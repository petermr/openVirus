    <rel_abs>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disorder caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2. The immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 patients, either systemic or local, have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, we analyzed both the changes in the cellularity of various immune cell types as well as cytokines important for immune reactions and inflammation. Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay underwent a similar "rise-decline" pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.</rel_abs>
