    <rel_abs>The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to a current pandemic of unprecedented levels. Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, many health systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test. Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close integral groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.</rel_abs>
