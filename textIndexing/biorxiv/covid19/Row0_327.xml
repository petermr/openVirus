    <rel_abs>Background Novel Coronavirus infection disease 2019 (NCOVID-19), caused by the corona virus, was first spotted in Wuhan, city of China, December 2019. The NCOVID-19 virus is spread among individuals through close communication in the form of droplets, not via airborne. Those individuals are at risk of infection who are in close contact with a NCOVID-19 patient or who take care of NCOVID-19 patients. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of any infection in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of basic knowledge and all procedures concerning prevention and protection from NCOVID-19. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the awareness level of healthcare workers toward NCOVID-2019 in Pakistan. Material and Methods A questionnaire was generated according to WHO information that was circulated among the healthcare workers of different hospitals and medical institutes of Pakistan. Calculated sample size was 650. Conclusion Healthcare workers have insufficient knowledge of preventive measures and infection control. The authorities must take initiatives on urgent basis to increase the awareness among the healthcare workers and general public also so that the drastic circumstances can be avoided in the developing country like Pakistan.</rel_abs>
