    <rel_abs>In February and March 2020, COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea met a large black swan effect by a Sincheonji cult mass infection in Daegu-Gyeongbuk area. The black swan made it difficult to evaluate that the current policies for infection prevention including social distancing, closing schools, hand washing, and wearing masks good enough or not. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated basic reproduction number (R0) and time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) of confirmed cases based on various kinds of populations, including total, Daegu-Geyoengbuk, except-Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Sincheonji, and except-Sincheonji. In total, it seems the infection is going to be under control, but this is never true because in the except-Sincheonji and except-Daegu-Geyongbuk cases, R0 is still above 1.0, and Rt is drifting around 1.0. This study could be used to determine government policies in the near future.</rel_abs>
