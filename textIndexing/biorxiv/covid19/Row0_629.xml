    <rel_abs>Background: The SARS-CoV-2 shares 74.5% genome identity with SARS-CoV, both exhibiting a similar well conserved structure. Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM &amp; IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.</rel_abs>
