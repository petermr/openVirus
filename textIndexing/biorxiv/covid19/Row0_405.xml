    <rel_abs>The purpose of the present paper is to present simple estimation and prediction methods for basic quantities in an emerging epidemic like the ongoing covid-10 pandemic. The simple methods have the advantage that relations between basic quantities become more transparent, thus shedding light to which quantities have biggest impact on predictions, with the additional conclusion that uncertainties in these quantities carry over to high uncertainty also in predictions. A simple non-parametric prediction method for future cumulative case fatalities, as well as future cumulative incidence of infections (assuming a given infection fatality risk f), is presented. The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude{rho} will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of epidemic models. This methodology is then reversed, thus enabling estimation of the preventive magnitude{rho} , and of the resulting effective reproduction number RE. However, the effects of preventive measures only start affecting case fatalities some 3-4 weeks later, so estimates are only available after this time has elapsed. The methodology is applicable in the early stage of an outbreak, before, say, 10% of the community have been infected. Beside giving simple estimation and prediction tools for an ongoing epidemic, another important conclusion lies in the observation that the two quantities f (infection fatality risk) and{rho} (the magnitude of preventive measures) have very big impact on predictions. Further, both of these quantities currently have very high uncertainty: current estimates of f lie in the range 0.2% up to 2% ([9], [7]), and the overall effect of several combined preventive measures is clearly very uncertain. The two main findings from the paper are hence that, a) any prediction containing f, and/or some preventive measures, contain a large amount of uncertainty (which is usually not acknowledged well enough), and b) obtaining more accurate estimates of in particular f, should be highly prioritized. Seroprevalence testing of random samples in a community where the epidemic has ended are urgently needed.</rel_abs>
