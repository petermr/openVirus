    <rel_abs>In recent days, Covid-19 coronavirus has been an immense impact on social, economic fields in the world. The objective of this study determines if it is feasible to use machine learning method to evaluate how much prediction results are close to original data related to Confirmed-Negative-Released-Death cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, a verification method is proposed in this paper that uses the concept of Deep-learning Neural Network. In this framework, Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are also assimilated finally for training the dataset and the prediction results are tally with the results predicted by clinical doctors. The prediction results are validated against the original data based on some predefined metric. The experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is useful in generating suitable results based on the critical disease outbreak. It also helps doctors to recheck further verification of virus by the proposed method. The outbreak of Coronavirus has the nature of exponential growth and so it is difficult to control with limited clinical persons for handling a huge number of patients with in a reasonable time. So it is necessary to build an automated model, based on machine learning approach, for corrective measure after the decision of clinical doctors. It could be a promising supplementary confirmation method for frontline clinical doctors. The proposed method has a high prediction rate and works fast for probable accurate identification of the disease. The performance analysis shows that a high rate of accuracy is obtained by the proposed method.</rel_abs>
