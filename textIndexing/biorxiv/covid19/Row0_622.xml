    <rel_abs>Background: Since January 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has spread rapidly and developing the pandemic model around the world. Data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of the affected patients in an imported cases as model in island outside Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study included all 168 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hainan province from 22 January 2020 to 13 March 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, radiological and laboratory data. Results: Of 168 patients, 160 have been discharged, 6 have died and 2 remain hospitalized. The median age was 51.0 years and 51.8% were females. 129 (76.8%) patients were imported cases, and 118 (70.2%), 51 (30.4%) and 52 (31%) of patients lived in Wuhan or traveled to Wuhan, had contact with Covid-19 patients, or had contact with Wuhan residents, respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (65.5%), dry cough (48.8%) and expectoration (32.1%). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (60.2%). The elderly people with diabetes, hypertension and CVD are more likely to develop severe cases. Follow-up of 160 discharged patients found that 20 patients (12.5%) had a positive RT-PCR test results of pharyngeal swabs or anal swabs or fecal. Conclusions: In light of the rapid spread of Covid-19 around the world, early diagnosis and quarantine is important to curb the spread of Covid-19 and intensive treatments in early stage is to prevent patients away from critical condition.</rel_abs>
