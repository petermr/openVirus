    <rel_abs>Background: At present, there is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Two previous case series from China have suggested that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, but the reports were limited by small numbers and few clinical information. Objective: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Four designated COVID-16 hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Medical records of 67 cancer patients admitted to hospitals between Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were included. Measurements: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Survival data of the cohort was cut-off on Mar 10, 2020. Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (P&lt;0.001). Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, and the proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient. Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19.</rel_abs>
