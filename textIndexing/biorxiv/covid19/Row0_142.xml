    <rel_abs>Mobility control measures are of crucial importance for public health planning in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies established the impact of population outflow from Wuhan on the spatial spread of coronavirus in China and hinted the impact of the other three mobility patterns, i.e., population outflow from Hubei province excluding Wuhan, population inflow from cities outside Hubei, and intra-city population movement. However, the overall impact of all mobility patterns, or the impact of the different timing of mobility restriction intervention, are not systematically analyzed. Here we apply the cumulative confirmed cases and mobility data of 350 Chinese cities outside Hubei to explore the relationships between all mobility patterns and epidemic spread, and estimate the impact of local travel restrictions, both in terms of level and timing, on the epidemic control based on mobility change. The relationships were identified by using Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise multivariable linear regression, while scenario simulation was used to estimate the mobility change caused by local travel restrictions. Our analysis shows that: (1) all mobility patterns correlated with the spread of the coronavirus in Chinese cities outside Hubei, while the corrleations droppd with the implemetation of travel restrictions; (2) the cumulative confirmed cases in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown was mainly brought by three patterns of inter-city population movement, while those in the third and fourth weeks after was significantly influenced by the number of intra-city population movement; (3) the local travel restrictions imposed by cities outside Hubei have averted 1,960 (95%PI: 1,474-2,447) more infections, taking 22.4% (95%PI: 16.8%-27.9%) of confirmed ones, in two weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, while more synchronized implementation would further decrease the number of confirmed cases in the same period by 15.7% (95%PI:15.4%-16.0%) or 1,378 (95%PI: 1,353-1,402) cases; and (4) local travel restrictions on different mobility patterns have different degrees of protection on cities with or without initial confirmed cases until the Wuhan lockdown. Our results prove the effectiveness of local travel restrictions and highlight the importance of synchronized implementation of mobility control across cities in mitigating the COVID-19 transmission.</rel_abs>
