    <rel_abs>Quick, simple and accurate diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 is very important for the screening and therapy of patients. Although several methods were performed in clinical practice, however, the IgM and IgG diagnostic value evaluation was little performed. 57 suspected COVID-19 infection patients were enrolled in our study. 24 patients with positive and 33 patients with negative nucleic acid test. The positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid was 42.10%. The positive detection rate of combination of IgM and IgG for patients with COVID-19 negative and positive nucleic acid test was 72.73% and 87.50%. The results were significantly higher than the nucleic acid or IgM, IgG single detection. hsCRP in the COVID-19 nucleic acid negative group showed significantly higher than the positive groups (P=0.0298). AST in the COVID-19 IgM negative group showed significantly lower than the positive groups (P=0.0365). We suggest a quick, simple, accurate aided detection method for the suspected patients and on-site screening in close contact with the population.</rel_abs>
