    <rel_abs>Background The illness progress of partial patient of COVID-19 is rapid and the mortality rate is high.we aim to describe the clinical features in death cases with COVID-19. Methods In this single center, observational study, We recruited all Death Cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.Demographics, basic diseases, X-ray/CT results, possible therapy strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, ICU and 48 h before death were collected and analyzed. Results This study involved 101 COVID-19 dead cases in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition.57 (56.44%) were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.The cases included 64 males and 37 females with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A 44.44%, type B 29.29%, type AB 8.08% and type O 18.19%.The clinical manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients),Cough (69[68.32%]) and dyspnea (75[74.26%]). Neutrophils, PCT, CRP,IL-6,D-dimer gradually increased as time went on.Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission,with the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased.61(60.40%) used antiviral drugs,59(58.42%) used glucocorticoids, 63.37% used intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% used thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) used restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) used antifungal drugs.84(83.17%) used non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 76.24% used invasive mechanical ventilation. 7 patients were treated with ECMO and 8 patients were treated with CRRT.The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00 days(IQR 0.00-6.00). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days (IQR2.00-8.00). Conclusions Critical COVID-19 can cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure with high mortality rate. Heart may be the earliest damaged organ except the lungs. Secondary infection in the later period is worthy of attention.</rel_abs>
