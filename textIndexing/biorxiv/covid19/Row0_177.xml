    <rel_abs>Abstract- The early detection of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of (COVID-19) is now a critical task for the clinical practitioners. The COVID-19 spread is announced as pandemic outbreak between people worldwide by WHO since 11/ March/ 2020. In this consequence, it is top critical priority to become aware of the infected people so that prevention procedures can be processed to minimize the COVID-19 spread and to begin early medical health care of those infected persons. In this paper, the deep studying based totally methodology is usually recommended for the detection of COVID-19 infected patients using X-ray images. The help vector gadget classifies the corona affected X-ray images from others through usage of the deep features. The technique is useful for the clinical practitioners for early detection of COVID-19 infected patients. The suggested system of multi-level thresholding plus SVM presented high accuracy in classification of the infected lung with Covid-19. All images were of the same size and stored in JPEG format with 512 * 512 pixels. The average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the lung classification using the proposed model results were 95.76%, 99.7%, and 97.48%, respectively.</rel_abs>
