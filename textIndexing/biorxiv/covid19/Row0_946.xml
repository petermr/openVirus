    <rel_abs>Background: Since mid-December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia-like diseases caused by a novel coronavirus, now designated COVID-19 by the WHO, emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. Conclusions: In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5oC, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease. Key words: 2019 novel coronavirus; acute respiratory infection; risk factors for disease severity</rel_abs>
