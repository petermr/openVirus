    <rel_abs>COVID-19 is spreading really fast around the world. The current study describes the situation of the outbreak of this disease in India and predicts the number of cases expected to rise in India. The study also discusses the regional analysis of Indian states and presents the preparedness level of India in combating this outbreak. The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate for India stands around 1.9. Kerala and Maharashtra are the top two infected states in India with more than 100 infected cases reported in each state, respectively. A total of 25 states have reported at least one infected case, however only 8 of them have reported deaths due to COVID-19. The ARIMA model prediction shows that the infected cases in India may reach up to 700 thousands in next 30 days in worst case scenario while most optimistic scenario may restrict the numbers up to 1000-1200. Also, the average forecast by ARIMA model in next 30 days is around 7000 patients from the current numbers of 536. Based on the forecasting model by Holts linear trends, an expected 3 million people may get infected if control measures are not taken in the near future. This study will be useful for the key stakeholders like Government Officials and Medical Practitioners in assessing the trends for India and preparing a combat plan with stringent measures. Also, this study will be helpful for data scientists, statisticians, mathematicians and analytics professionals in predicting outbreak numbers with better accuracy.</rel_abs>
