    <rel_abs>Novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic condition world-wide and has been declared as public health emergency of International concern by WHO in a very short span of time. The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain and USA among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product. Thus, this present study provides an initial platform of the rapid generation of an efficacious protective vaccine for combating COVID-19.</rel_abs>
