    <rel_abs>In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China. World Health Organization (WHO) declared the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020, acknowledging what has seemed clear for some time-the virus will likely spread to all countries on the globe. As of February 11, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) has officially reported that there are 2.0% (889) asymptomatic cases, 2.3% (1,023) death cases, and 80.9% mild cases among 44,672 confirmed cases. 51.4% (22,981) were male and 48.6% (21,691) were female. Lymphopenia, in particular T lymphopenia, was common among patients with SARS-COV-2 in the observation. A notable drop in CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts occurred early in the course of the syndrome and was associated with adverse outcomes. The appearing a phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) suggested severe adverse outcomes. The outcome observed: 60% had discharged and 20% had die.</rel_abs>
