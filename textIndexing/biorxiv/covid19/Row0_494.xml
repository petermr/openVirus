    <rel_abs>Objective: To compare the difference of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female COVID-19 patients and figure out a possible explanation for different outcome between male and female patients. Methods: A total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The plasma of these patients were collected during hospitalization and were detected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Afterwards, the difference of IgG antibody between male and female patients was analyzed. Results: The level of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed on difference between male and female. In severe status, the average IgG antibody level in female patients tended to be higher than that of in male patients. Compared with male patients, most of the female patients generated a relatively high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in severe status. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female tended to be stronger than male patients in disease early phase. Conclusions: The inconsistent of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody generation in male and female patients may account for the different outcome of COVID-19 between gender.</rel_abs>
