    <rel_abs>Purpose: COVID-19 has become global threaten. CT acts as an important method of diagnosis. However, human-based interpretation of CT imaging is time consuming. More than that, substantial inter-observer-variation cannot be ignored. We aim at developing a diagnostic tool for artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification of CT images for recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung. Experimental Design: In this study, images were retrospectively collected and prospectively analyzed using machine learning. CT scan images of the lung that show or do not show COVID-19 were used to train and validate a classification framework based on convolutional neural network. Five conditions including COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung were evaluated. Training and validation set of images were collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital whereas test set of images were collected from Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University and the fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Results: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI framework were reported. For test dataset, accuracies for recognizing normal lung, COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis were 99.4%, 98.8%, 98.5%, 98.3%, and 98.6%, respectively. For the test dataset, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of recognizing COVID-19 were 98.8%, 98.2%, 98.9%, 94.5%, and 99.7%, respectively. Conclusions: The performance of the proposed AI framework has excellent performance of recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung, which also has balanced sensitivity and specificity.</rel_abs>
