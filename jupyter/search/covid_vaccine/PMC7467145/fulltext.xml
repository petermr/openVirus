Although no proven therapies are identified yet which can offer a definitive treatment of the COVID-19, a series of antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic, immunosuppressant drugs have shown clinical benefits based on repurposing theory. However, these studies are made on small number of patients, and, in majority of the cases, have been carried out as nonrandomized trials. As society is running against the time to combat the COVID-19, we present here a comprehensive review dealing with up-to-date information of therapeutics or drug regimens being utilized by physicians to treat COVID-19 patients along with in-depth discussion of mechanism of action of these drugs and their targets. Ongoing vaccine trials, monoclonal antibodies therapy and convalescent plasma treatment are also discussed. Keeping in mind that computational approaches can offer a significant insight to repurposing based drug discovery, an exhaustive discussion of computational modeling studies is performed which can assist target-specific drug discovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Graphic abstract</title><p id="Par2">

The deadly disease was later termed as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020. The identified causative novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as it shares around 79.6% of genome similarity with SARS-CoV which also previously emerged in China during 2002&#x02013;2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. With the announcement of COVID-19 as &#x02018;Global Pandemic&#x02019; by WHO on March 11, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has eventually affected 212 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances. As of August 13, 2020, 20,881,635 cases have been confirmed with 748,503 deaths and 13,771,549 recovery cases, while among the active cases, 6,297,028 cases are in mild condition and 64,555 cases in a serious or critical condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> The global trend of COVID-19 reported death, recovered and active cases till August 13, 2020; <bold>b</bold> structure of SARS-CoV-2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11030_2020_10134_Fig1_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">The literature reported seven coronaviruses (CoVs) that are known to cause human disease where the strains 229E (&#x003b1;-CoV), HKU1 (&#x003b2;-CoV), OC43 (&#x003b2;-CoV) and NL63 (&#x003b1;-CoV) caused mild infections of the upper respiratory tract in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. On the contrary, other two strains SARS-CoV (occurring in 2002&#x02013;2003) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome occurring in 2012) and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 belonging to &#x003b2;-CoV have caused serious health threat and fatality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The present scenario and available pathophysiology specify that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable and contagious than its progenitor affecting not only the respiratory system but also the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, kidney, heart and liver leading to multiple organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 spike S glycoprotein has 72% identical sequence with human SARS with a unique furin-like cleavage site, which is absent in other SARS-like CoVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The Cryo-EM structural evidence has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has 10&#x02013;20 times higher binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV which may lead to higher transmission and contagiousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, blocking of the isolated viral S protein at its host receptor region and/or binding within the S protein-ACE2 interface are the two most important strategies to design probable drugs for COVID-19 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus replicates via multiple processes after entering into the host cell, and the proteins associated with these replication steps are the principal targets to treat the infected patients by blocking the viral replication.

In most of the active cases, physicians are relying on symptom-based treatment for mild cases and primarily oxygen therapy (if required, with ventilator support) for critically ill patients. A set of approved marketed drugs like hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], chloroquine (CLQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], combination of HCQ and azithromycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], remdesivir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], lopinavir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and ritonavir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] are being evaluated for the infection treatment; their clinical trials are also going on in different pharmaceutical industries. A series of new vaccines are also under clinical trial such as mRNA-1273 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Ad5-nCoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and ChAdOx1 nCoV19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] along with existing Bacillus Calmette&#x02013;Guerin (BCG) vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to check its efficiency in COVID-19.

The RCSB protein data bank (PDB) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org">www.rcsb.org</ext-link>) has already deposited around 110 protein crystal structures associated with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 to allow understanding important structural binding sites which can be explored in rational designing of small molecules.</p><p id="Par11">The current review discusses the most updated and probable drug candidates which are being experimentally used to treat patients in different parts of the world. Also, their possible targets and pharmacological mechanisms of action which might not be clear in many cases and their pathophysiology along with the details about the status of convalescent plasma treatment and ongoing vaccine trials are discussed. We have compiled up-to-date in silico studies providing information related to computational tools, employed protein crystal structure used in the study followed by probable future drug candidates evolved from the repurposed virtual screening (VS) study employing docking, molecular dynamics (MD) and homology modeling. Therefore, the details related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, protein structures, epidemiology, disease spectrum, diagnosis and testing are not discussed here at all as they have already been discussed in multiple literatures and separate reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The present review is significantly different from the other recently published ones on a similar topic in that it covers and gives emphasis on the in silico modeling studies in search of drugs against COVID-19.

In both ways, spike proteins (S1, S2) of SARS-CoV-2 mediate attachment to the membrane of a host cell and engage angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor. Inhibitors like convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies&#x000a0;bind to the spike glycoprotein, thus preventing the viral entry. When virions are taken up into endosomes, the spike protein can be activated by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 in close proximity to the ACE2 receptor, which initiates fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane. Camostat mesylate inhibits the TMPRSS2 receptor. The plasma membrane fusion entry is less likely to trigger host cell antiviral immunity and therefore more efficient for viral replication. After the viral RNA is released into the host cell, polyproteins are translated. The coronavirus genomic RNA encodes non-structural proteins that have a critical role in the synthesis of viral RNA and structural proteins which are important for virion assembly. First, polyproteins are translated and cleaved by some of proteases like 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, PL<sup>pro</sup>, etc. (lopinavir, ritonavir and darunavir act as inhibitors of this step) to form RNA replicase-transcriptase complex. The non-structural protein RdRp is responsible for replication of structural protein RNA. (Remdesivir, favilavir and ribavirin act as inhibitors of this enzyme). Structural proteins S1, S2, envelope and membrane are translated by ribosomes that are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and presented on its surface as preparation of virion assembly. The nucleocapsids (N) remain in cytoplasm and are assembled from genomic RNA. They fuse with the virion precursor which is then transported from the ER through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface via small vesicles. The mature virions are then released from the infected cell through exocytosis, and then, they search another host cell (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) blockers</title><p id="Par14">SARS-CoV-2 has transmembrane spikes (S protein). The spikes attached to the lipid membrane of the coronavirus recognize a host cell to attach and infect it with its viral RNA. The attachment of the coronavirus S protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at its cellular binding site promotes the entry into human cells. The S protein contains two subunits such as an N-terminal S1 subunit which is responsible for receptor-virus binding and a C-terminal S2 subunit which is responsible for the fusion of virus with cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The S1 subunit has two domains such as a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and an N-terminal domain (NTD). At the time of infection, at first coronavirus binds to the human cell through interaction between the cell ACE2 receptor and S1-RBD of coronavirus. As a result, conformational changes in the S2 subunit are triggered followed by virus-cell fusion and entry into the target cell. ACE2 is a natural protein present in the lungs and the intestine (epithelial cells), and in the heart and the kidneys (endothelial cells). ACE2 regulates the blood pressure by converting angiotensin molecules. It was found that the coronavirus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2002 also binds to the same ACE2 molecule, but in case of SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinity is 10 to 20 times more on human cells than the spike from the SARS virus of 2002, which makes it a suitable target for COVID-19. Due to the high affinity of this virus to human cells, it is spread without any difficulty from one person to another than the earlier virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cells via binding with ACE2 enzyme leads to ACE2 down-regulation. As a result, angiotensin II is produced excessively by the correlated enzyme ACE1, while a lower amount of ACE2 is not capable of transforming it to the vasodilator heptapeptide angiotensin 1&#x02013;7. Thus, expression of higher ACE2 resulting from frequently medicating COVID-19 patients with AT1R blockers may resist them against acute lung injury. This can be described by following two complementary mechanisms: (1) blocking the excessive angiotensin II-mediated AT1R activation caused by the viral infection, (2) upregulation of ACE2 decreasing angiotensin II production by ACE and enhancing the production of the vasodilator angiotensin 1&#x02013;7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The role of ACE2 to enter the coronavirus into the host cell and mechanism of action of ACE2 inhibitors to control the COVID-19 are depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>The role of ACE2 receptor for the entry of coronavirus into the host cell, and mechanism of action of ACE2 inhibitors and TMPRSS2 inhibitors to control COVID-19</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11030_2020_10134_Fig7_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">The SARS-CoV-2 uses the S protein to facilitate viral entry into the host cells. The pathogen S protein consists of two subunits S1 and S2, of which &#x0201c;S1&#x0201d; allows entry of pathogen and binding of S protein to ACE2 (cellular receptor) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In addition, the entry requires S protein priming by cellular proteases, which is responsible for cleavage of S protein. After this, &#x0201c;S2&#x0201d; subunit employs fusion of viral and cellular membranes. SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor that can be blocked by ACE2 inhibitors and Arbidol, and it employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming which is inhibited by camostat mesylate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Conclusively, SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interface occurs in the molecular level, and the efficiency of ACE2 usage is a key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility.</p><p id="Par17">Although it is widely accepted that coronavirus enters into the host cell through the ACE2 receptor, due to limited number of studies, it is yet to establish how ACE2, AT1 and AT2 receptors exert their activities in coronavirus-induced diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

An antimalarial drug, CLQ, has recently been reported to have potential in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. CLQ protects from viral infection by enhancing endosomal pH (making the environment unfavorable) which is required for virus-cell fusion. This drug may also block viral infection by inhibiting viral enzymes or processes like viral DNA and RNA polymerases, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, immunomodulation of cytokine release and virus release. CLQ also affects the glycosylation process of ACE2 (as discussed earlier that to enter the host cell, the viral S protein binds with this receptor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

In the NTD of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, a ganglioside-binding site was recognized. The antimalarial drug CLQ was found to be a probable blocker of the S&#x02013;ganglioside interaction. Thus, this drug may be used to fight pathogenic coronaviruses especially SARS-CoV-2 which is responsible for COVID-19. A detailed mechanism of action of CLQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. A recent report showed that the EC<sub>90</sub> value of CLQ against the SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells was 6.9&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M, which may be clinically achievable.

The mechanism 1 is that CLQ and its derivative HCQ are weak bases, which can raise the pH of acidic intracellular organelles, such as endosomes/lysosomes, essential for membrane fusion. On the other hand, mechanism-2 explains the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells also depends upon sialic acid (Neu5Ac) containing glycoproteins and gangliosides that act as the key binding factors along the respiratory tract. A ganglioside-binding site at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was recognized, and CLQ was found to be a possible blocker of the S&#x02013;ganglioside interaction which occurs in the first step of the viral replication cycle (i.e., attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, intermediated by the S protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The interaction was augmented by placing the negative charge of the carboxylate anion of Neu5Ac and one of the two positive charges of CLQ. SARS-CoV-2 especially interacted with 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl-<italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (9-<italic>O</italic>-SIA). In this case, the carboxylic acid group of the sialic acid interacted with the cationic group of the nitrogen-containing ring of CLQ. The formed complex of CLQ and 9-<italic>O</italic>-SIA was further stabilized by OH-&#x003c0; and van der Waals interactions. Next, the complex developed from HCQ was very close to that obtained from CLQ, although numerous conformational adjustments happened for the period of the simulations. Interestingly, the &#x02013;OH group of HCQ reinforced the binding of CLQ to Neu5Ac via formation of a hydrogen bond. The formed complex of CLQ-OH and 9-<italic>O</italic>-SIA will be stabilized again like CLQ to form a protective layer against fusion of the SARS&#x02013;CoV-2.</p><p id="Par22">HCQ is a hydroxy derivative of CLQ, which can block the viral infection by a similar mechanism as chloroquine; thus, this drug may also be a potential candidate against SARS-CoV-2.

In case of Influenza virus, it selectively inhibits RNA polymerase which is essential for viral replication when human cells are infected. It is believed that this drug may be effective for the treatment of COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 uses same enzyme (RNA polymerase) for replication and classification into the same type of single-stranded RNA virus like influenza.

Thus, the basic ideas of implication of in silico tools and repurposing of approved drugs are same, but the only difference is selection of the target protein in different studies. Without any doubt, the crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) in complex with an inhibitor N3 (PDB: 6LU7) is the most accessed protein for the drug discovery.

An unexplored concept under in silico tools</title><p id="Par39">Multiple incidents illustrated the outbreak of corona virus in animals, especially in pets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. Animals from dogs, cats, tigers, lions to minks are already tested positive and showed mild to severe symptoms of corona virus, followed by death of few instances. Although these events are scattered and not enough to study in the middle of human crisis, we cannot ignore the fact of human to animal transmission. If human to animal transmission is true, then there is a possibility of mutations, insertions and deletions in the genome sequence of this deadly virus in these animals in future with probabilities of zoonotic transfer of a stronger form of present SARS-CoV-2 virus from them to human in the near future. Thus, these small incidents need to be checked very carefully to avoid any future transmission.</p><p id="Par40">The above-mentioned facts help to build an interspecies analysis by Kar and Leszczynski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] for animals to human transmission or vice versa to aid in the drug discovery process of COVID-19 in upcoming days. The in silico interspecies-quantitative structure&#x02013;activity relationship (i-QSAR) modeling correlates and then extrapolates the response (activity/toxicity) data from animal source to human which will be helpful for drug discovery. Due to genome sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with the pangolins and bat, experimental data of drug candidates to pangolins/bat along with structural and physicochemical properties of drugs can be correlated with human response endpoint which is the first step of modeling. In the next step, extrapolation of animal data to human data can lead to no human testing through developed i-QSAR model. Once the acceptable predictive i-QSAR model is ready, there might be no need of future animal testing. As bat and pangolins are endangered species, thus future introspection can be performed in dogs and cats due to their better accessibility as well as considering them possible carriers of SARS-CoV-2 from the recent incidents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">Researchers from all over the world are trying to find the medicines which will help to stop the transmission of the virulent SARS-CoV-2 virus, mitigate the symptoms of the infected patients and help to lower the death toll throughout the world. Unfortunately, till now there is no silver gunshot which can solve this pandemic COVID-19. We have reported here a comprehensive and updated discussion on drug or drug candidates under investigation with their probable targets and mechanisms of action which might not be clear for many cases earlier, along with the effort of ongoing vaccine trials, monoclonal antibodies therapy and convalescent plasma treatment. We have presented here the ongoing computational efforts related to in silico tools to explore the probable drug candidates against COVID-19 along with the up-to-date target protein information. The information provided from in silico approaches may work as a magic bullet for the medicinal chemists to accelerate the drug discovery and development process. Overall, this review provides a strong intellectual foundation to support progress of ongoing research related to thorough knowledge of drugs or investigational drugs, vaccines and in silico approaches which can be helpful for the development of new drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Probir Kumar Ojha and Supratik Kar have contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>PKO thanks the UGC, New Delhi, for financial assistance in the form of a fellowship (F./PDFSS-2015-17-WES-11996).
