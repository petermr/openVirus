Published investigations mostly on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS has taught lessons on vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus. This is attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on the host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances. The COVID-19 pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after Spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted immune-potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this virus. This review is aimed at providing an overview of the efforts dedicated to an effective vaccine for this novel coronavirus which has crippled the world in terms of economy, human health and life.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Clinical Trials</kwd><kwd>Convalescent Plasma Therapy</kwd><kwd>Monoclonal Antibodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwd0010"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</kwd><kwd>CoV, Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2</kwd><kwd>MERS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019</kwd><kwd>hACE2, Human Angiotensin- Converting Enzyme 2</kwd><kwd>DPP4, Dipeptidyl Peptidase</kwd><kwd>ARDS, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</kwd><kwd>RBD, Receptor Binding Domains</kwd><kwd>RBM, Receptor Binding Motif</kwd><kwd>NSP, Non-structural Proteins</kwd><kwd>NTD, N Terminal Domain</kwd><kwd>TMPRSS2, Transmembrane Protease Serine 2</kwd><kwd>VLP, Virus-Like Particle</kwd><kwd>TLR, Toll-Like Receptor</kwd><kwd>LAV, Live Attenuated Vaccine</kwd><kwd>CP, Convalescent Plasma</kwd><kwd>LNP, Lipid Nanoparticle</kwd><kwd>DC, Dendritic Cells</kwd><kwd>ADE, Antibody-Dependent Enhancement</kwd><kwd>nAb, Neutralizing Antibody</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0160">The novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have emerged last year in 2019 in Wuhan from Bats. Crossing the species barrier it entered human beings with furtherance of infection through human to human transmission. The beta-coronaviruses have jumped between the species and have caused three zoonotic outbreaks namely, SARS CoV (2002-03), MERS-CoV (2012), and SARS-CoV-2 (2019- till date) in the last 2 decades. The existence of a myriad of coronaviruses in bats, including many SARS-related CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related Coronaviruses) and the sporadic crossing over of the species barriers of the coronaviruses to humans, suggest that the future occurrences of zoonotic transmission events may sustain (<xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0165">Since its emergence in Nov 2019, it has spread to 188 countries and 25 territories around the globe, despite elaborate efforts by WHO and Governments to contain the infection, primarily owing to the highly infectious nature of this virus (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Anon, 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Anon, 2020b</xref>). As of 2 July 2020, 10,533,779 cases have been reported globally with 512,842 deaths (<xref rid="bib0505" ref-type="bibr">(WHO) World Health Organisation, 2020</xref>). There has been a monumental increase in the number of infected patients, with a 7-day moving average of 210,209 cases per day, as of 2 July 2020 (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Anon, 2020a</xref>). SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious virus, tends to spread by the inhalation of the respiratory aerosols, direct human contact, and via fomites. Social distancing, personal hygiene, frequent hand washing or sanitizing using the alcohol (61-70%) based hand-sanitizers, and disinfection of the surfaces are some steps which can protect the individuals from getting infected (<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">(CDC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020</xref>). R<sub>0</sub> is an epidemiological scale; used to measure the contagiousness of an infectious agent. Its magnitude depends upon various biological, environmental, and socio-behavioral factors. It can be defined as &#x0201c;the average number of secondary cases one would produce in a completely susceptible population in the absence of any deliberate intervention in disease transmission (<xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Delamater et al., 2019</xref>).&#x0201d; SARS-CoV-2 has an R<sub>0</sub> value range of 2-3 (<xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr">Park, 2020</xref>) which is significantly higher in comparison to Spanish flu for which the R<sub>0</sub> was recorded at 0.9-2.1 (<xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr">Pyrek, 2018</xref>). According to WHO, people living with non-communicable diseases (co-morbid conditions) are prone to severe illness due to COVID-19 infection. The incubation period of the virus ranges from 2-14 days with a median of 5.1 days (<xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">Lauer et al., 2020</xref>). The symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, chills, muscles pain, headache, gastric disturbances and weight loss (<xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">CDC, 2020</xref>). Some patients may have lymphopenia and bilateral ground-glass opacity changes in the chest CT scans. The histological examinations of the lungs&#x02019; biopsy samples have shown a bilaterally diffused alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. A few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were observed both in the liver and the heart specimens (<xref rid="bib0525" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). However, a large population of the infected patients have no or mild symptoms and remain asymptomatic (<xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Shang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0170">Structurally coronaviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped viruses with a characteristic fringe of projections composed of S protein on their surface. These viruses are equipped with a positive sense ssRNA genome, which is complexed with the nucleocapsid (N) protein forming helical nucleocapsids. The genome is both capped and polyadenylated (<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Carter and Saunders, 2007</xref>). The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has revealed 79% similarity with a total of 380 amino acid substitutions condensed mainly within the NSP genes. Out of these substitutions, there are 27 amino acid replacements in the immune-dominant S protein while 102 and 61 amino acid substitutions are found in the NSP3 and NSP2. Whereas, NSP7, NSP13, E protein, and some accessory proteins are devoid of any amino acid substitutions (<xref rid="bib0520" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind a common host receptor, hACE2, to gain entry into the cell but SARS-CoV-2 binds the receptor with a higher affinity than the SARS-CoV. MERS-CoV uses an entirely different receptor that is, Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) (<xref rid="bib0495" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2020</xref>) and the virus is distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 with around 50% similarity as per the sequence analysis of the two viruses (<xref rid="bib0420" ref-type="bibr">Prof Roujian et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0175">The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is transcribed in at least 10 Open Reading Frames (ORFs). ORF1ab translates into a polyprotein which is processed into 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs) (<xref rid="bib0540" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimoto, 2020</xref>). The NSPs perform various functions like genome replication, inducing the cleavage of host mRNA, membrane rearrangement, generation of the autophagosome, cleavage of the NSP polyprotein, capping, tailing, methylation, unwinding of the RNA duplex, etc. which are essential for the viral life cycle (<xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">da Silva et al., 2020</xref>). Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus contains four structural proteins namely, spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins which are encoded by the 3&#x02019;-end of the viral genome (<xref rid="bib0515" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). Amongst the 4 structural proteins the S glycoprotein, being a large multi-functional trans-membrane protein, plays the vital role of viral attachment, fusion, and entry into the host cell (<xref rid="bib0515" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). The S protein consists of S1 and S2 subunits, which are further split into different functional domains. The S1 subunit has two functional domains viz. N-terminal Domain (NTD) and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and the latter contains conserved receptor binding motif (RBM) (<xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). The alignment studies have revealed that the region of RBD sequence lies between the residues 331 and 524 of the S protein (<xref rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr">Tai et al., 2020</xref>). Whereas, the S2 subunit has three operational domains namely, fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1, and 2. The S1 protein trimer aligns itself at the top of the trimeric S2 stalk to form the immune-dominant S protein (<xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, a furin cleavage site is observed within the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 while it is absent in the SARS-CoV which may be a possible explanation of the variation in the pathogenicity of the virus (<xref rid="bib0485" ref-type="bibr">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). A host trans-membrane protease serine 2, (TMPRSS2) is responsible for the initial priming of the spike protein. The virus can utilize both TMPRSS2 and endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) to initiate entry into the cell. The TMPRSS2 is responsible for the cleavage of the S protein to expose the FP region of the S2 subunit which is responsible for the initiation of the endosome mediated entry into the host cell. This indicates that TMPRSS2 is a host factor that is essential for viral entry; therefore, the drugs approved for the inhibition of this protease (like camostatmesylate) could be used for therapeutic purposes (<xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann and Kleine-Weber, 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 uses the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor to seize the target cell through the spike glycoprotein (S-Protein), . It has been suggested that the coronaviruses exercise the use of conformational masking and glycan shielding of the spike protein to circumvent the host immune cells. The Cryo-EM structures have revealed the presence of two distinct: closed and open conformations of the S-Protein ectodomain trimer, as a consequence of the opening of the structure at the trimer apex. This conformational diversification is necessary for the receptor binding as the trimer opening exposes the RBM which is present at the interface between the protomers in the closed trimers (<xref rid="bib0490" ref-type="bibr">Walls, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0180">The E protein that forms E channels (called the viroporins), and is involved in a myriad of functions in the viral replication cycle involving assembly, release, pathogenesis, etc. (<xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">Gralinski and Menachery, 2020</xref>). These reprobate ion channels exist in the form of homo-pentamers with each subunit containing 50-120 amino acids. E channels contain at least one trans-membrane domain (TMD) which facilitates the linkage in host cell membranes. SARS CoVs generally contain three categories of ion channels namely: E, 8a, and 3a. The E and 8a ion channels contain the PDZ (Post Synaptic Density Protein; Disc Large Tumor Suppressor; Zonula Occludens-1 Protein) Domain Binding Motif (PBM) which is responsible for the over-expression of the inflammatory cytokines which may result in the cytokine storm (<xref rid="bib0410" ref-type="bibr">Pharmaceutical Targeting the Envelope Protein of SARS-CoV-2: the Screening for Inhibitors in Approved Drugs, 2020</xref>). From the sequence alignment study of the E protein, it was observed that a negatively charged glutamate residue (E69) in SARS-CoV corresponds to a positively charged arginine residue (R69) in SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="bib0540" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimoto, 2020</xref>). However, this mutation is remote from the inhibitor binding site; therefore, E protein can be used as a pharmaceutical target (<xref rid="bib0410" ref-type="bibr">Pharmaceutical Targeting the Envelope Protein of SARS-CoV-2: the Screening for Inhibitors in Approved Drugs, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0185">M protein, the central organizer of CoV assembly, is most abundantly expressed in the virus particle. It functions crucially in the morphogenesis and assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the essential structural proteins (<xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">Conserved Protein Domain Family: SARS-like-CoV_M, 2020</xref>). The binding of the M and N protein stabilizes the N protein and RNA complex, and the internal core of the virus. In case of SARS-CoV, the M protein has also been shown to induce the process of apoptosis in the host cell (<xref rid="bib0540" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimoto, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0190">In addition to stabilizing the ssRNA genome of the virus particle, the N protein is an antagonist of the antiviral RNAi. It is responsible for the inhibition of the cell cycle of the host cell as it can inhibit the entry of the cell into the S-phase (<xref rid="bib0540" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimoto, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0195">Immunotherapy is considered as an effective method for the prophylaxis and treatment of various infectious diseases and cancers, which involves the artificial triggering of the immune system to elicit the immune response (<xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">Masihi, 2001</xref>). A vaccine that elicits the production of S protein neutralizing antibodies in the vaccinated subjects is the primary aim of all the programs for COVID-19 vaccines. Studies have revealed that there is a limited to no cross-neutralization between the sera of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that recovery from one infection may not shield against the other (<xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">Ou et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, a database of approximately 5500 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from various countries is now available at NCBI which facilitates delineating the polymorphisms in S protein and other important proteins of the virus concerning vaccine development. The rationale for writing this review is to gather all the information about the COVID-19 vaccine development programs and give the readers and researchers insight into types of vaccines being worked upon and the current status of the clinical trials of these vaccines for ready reference.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Vaccination strategies</title><p id="par0200">Many efforts have been directed towards the development of the vaccines against COVID-19, to avert the pandemic and most of the developing vaccine candidates have been using the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">Dhama et al., 2020</xref>). As of July 2, 2020, the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccine landscape includes 158 vaccine candidates, out of which 135 are in the preclinical or the exploratory stage of their development. Currently, mRNA-1273 (Moderna), Ad5-nCoV (CanSino Biologicals), INO-4800 (Inovio, Inc.), LV-SMENP-DC, Pathogen-specific aAPC (ShinzenGeno-Immune Medical Institute), and ChAdOx1 (University of Oxford) have entered the phase I/II clinical trials (<xref rid="bib0510" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020</xref>). The vaccines which are in the conduit are based upon inactivated or live attenuated viruses, protein sub-unit, virus-like particles (VLP), viral vector (replicating and non- replicating), DNA, RNA, nanoparticles, etc. with each exhibiting unique advantages and hindarances (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
) (<xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">Ning et al., 2020</xref>). COVID-19 vaccine landscape with percentage share of different types of vaccine is represented in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
. To enhance the immunogenicity, various adjuvant technologies like AS03 (GSK), MF-59 (Novartis), CpG 1018 (Dynavax), etc. are now accessible to the researchers for the vaccine development (<xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">Le et al., 2020</xref>). The immuno-informatics approach is also used for the epitope identification for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. It can be used to identify the significant cytotoxic T cell and B-cell epitopes in the viral proteins (<xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib0170"

The subunit vaccine, however, exhibits low immunogenicity and requires auxiliary support of an adjuvant to potentiate the vaccine-induced immune responses.

The addition of an adjuvant, therefore, helps in overcoming the shortcomings of the protein subunit vaccines (<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). The S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the most suitable antigen to induce the neutralizing antibodies against the pathogen. The S Protein consists of two subunits.

However, further clinical trials are essential to establish the effectiveness of the mAb (<xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">Michot et al., 2020</xref>). Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) claims to have successfully developed the mAb against SARS-CoV-2. The institute is in the process of patenting it which may soon be commercialized (<xref rid="bib0470" ref-type="bibr">Upadhyay, 2020</xref>). A group led by Professor Vijay Chaudhary at the University of Delhi, Centre for Innovation in Infectious Disease Research, Education and Training (UDSC-CIIDRET), is isolating the genes encoding the antibodies responsible for the neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2. These genes will be employed to foster the recombinant Ab by exploiting the pre-existing in-house antibody library and a library fabricated from the cells of convalescent COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="bib0415" ref-type="bibr">PIB, Delhi, 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0125"><label>4</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="par0325">The duration of clinical trials poses a sizable amount of hindrance to swift vaccine development. According to the norms laid down by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and WHO, a vaccine candidate has to pass through at least three phases of placebo-controlled clinical trials for the validation of its safety and efficacy, which can take years to complete. Considering the severity of the pandemic, which has forced a complete shut-down of the global economy, speedy vaccine development is necessary. Some authors suggest that the controlled human challenge studies may be conducted to suitably divert the Phase 3 testing, and allow the rapid licensure of the immunogenic vaccines. However, in the expanded field study participants will be monitored constantly to look for any long-term implications posed by the vaccine. Furthermore, the safety trials for the special groups including, children and pregnant women, and immuno-compromised patients can be conducted before the extension of the vaccination to these groups (<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Eyal et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0330">The testing and development of safe and effective vaccines rely upon laboratory animal models. These animal models must show a similar course of the disease as in human beings. However, the standard inbred strains of mice are not susceptible to the COVID-19 infection, due to the difference between the humans and mice ACE2 receptors (<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Anon, 2020D</xref>). This calls for the development of transgenic mice, expressing the hACE2 receptor. Two animal models (hACE2 transgenic mice model and another, primate Macaques model) were previously developed for the SARS-CoV but the current situation requires steady breeding and distribution of these animal models to meet demands of the researchers around the globe (<xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">Mice and Bao, 2020</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates can efficiently replicate in the lungs of the Syrian hamsters. The lungs of infected hamsters exhibit the pathological lesions analogous to the COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. Moreover, the nAb response exhibited by the infected hamster demonstrated immunity against the succeeding re-challenge studies. Furthermore, the transfusion of convalescent sera into the na&#x000ef;ve hamsters mounted the antibody response and hence hindered the viral replication in the lungs. The assemblage of these experiments have illustrated the Syrian hamster may be a perfect model for comprehending SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and evaluating antiviral drugs, and the immunotherapies (<xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">Imai and Iwatsuki-Horimoto, 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the assessment of the vaccine dependent immune enhancement cannot be extrapolated from the animal models and requires a legitimate survey from stage III human trials or the human challenge studies.</p><p id="par0335">The Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) is exploited by various viruses like Dengue, HIV, animal coronaviruses, etc. as an alternative method of infecting a variety of host cells. The virus-antibody complex can bind to the Fc receptors, activate the complement system, or induce a conformational change in the glycoprotein of the viral envelope (<xref rid="bib0535" ref-type="bibr">Yip et al., 2016</xref>). This mechanism is observed when the vaccine-induced antibodies are either non-neutralizing or they are present in inadequate concentrations. This process triggers the viral entry into the cell due to the intensified binding efficiency of the virus-antibody complexes to FcR bearing cells. The clinical and preclinical trials of SARS-CoV vaccine candidates have demonstrated the aggravation of the disease due to ADE. Vaccine Associated Enhanced Respiratory Disease (VAERD) can also be induced by virus-antibody immune complex and T<sub>H</sub>2-biased responses (<xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">Graham, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0340">The viral genome is vulnerable to mutations and can undergo the antigenic shift and the antigenic drift, as it continues to spread from one population to the next. The mutations may vary according to the environmental conditions of a geographical area, and the population density. By screening the 7500 samples of the infected patients, the scientists were able to figure out 198 mutations that may have materialized independently which may indicate the evolution of the virus inside the human host. These mutations may lead to different subtypes which may allow the virus to escape the immune system even after the administration of the vaccine (<xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">Dorp et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec0130"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="par0345">SARS-CoV-2 has been the matter of the moment from the date it was declared as a pandemic, it has led to the termination of economic activities universally. Scientists across the continents are joining hands for the innovative tie-ups with both the pharmaceutical giants and the medical start-ups to repurpose drugs, develop vaccines, and devices to impede the progress of this overwhelming pandemic. A large number of COVID-19 vaccine candidates based upon various platforms have already been identified. Despite the undergoing efforts, a definitive answer does not exist. The process of vaccine development is quite laborious with various stages, including the pre-clinical stage, and clinical development which is a three-phase process. However, if sufficient data is already available, it has been recommended to skip a few stages, to accelerate the attainment of a vaccine faster with a quick regulatory review, approval, manufacturing, and quality control. This novel Coronavirus has therefore forced the scientific community to use unconventional approaches to accelerate the process of vaccine development. According to WHO: &#x0201c;vaccine must provide a highly favorable benefit-risk contour; with high efficacy, only mild or transient adverse effects and no serious ailments.&#x0201d; The vaccine must be suitable for all ages, pregnant, and lactating women and should provide a rapid onset of protection with a single dose and confer safety for at least up to one year of administration.</p><p id="par0350">The use of novel technologies for vaccine development requires extensive testing for the safety and efficacy of a vaccine. The scientific community needs to construct various processes and capacities for the largescale manufacturing and administration of the coronavirus vaccines. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), an international non-governmental organization, which is funded by the Wellcome Trust, the European Commission, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and eight countries, is subsidizing the development of a large number of pandemic vaccine candidates around the globe. Moderna and the Vaccine Research Centre are co-developing an mRNA based vaccine candidate, wherein the mRNA is encapsulated in the lipid nanoparticles while Codagenix in collaboration with the Serum Institute of India is currently focused on developing the live attenuated viral vaccine. The pharmaceutical giants like Novavax, Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals, iBio, and the University of Queensland are in the preclinical stage of the recombinant S glycoprotein vaccines. Additional strategies like the viral vector-based vaccines, targeting the S glycoprotein are being developed by the University of Oxford and CanSino Biologics, and other companies, Inovio and the Applied DNA Sciences are currently developing the DNA based vaccine candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 S Protein. Some of these vaccine candidates are at least months, away from being ready for human use, while others may take longer if at all approved for final use.</p><p id="par0355">In India alone, six biotech ventures i.e. Serum Institute of India, ZydusCadila, Biological E, Indian Immunologicals, Bharat Biotech, and Mynvax are working in collaboration with various international vaccine developers. They are working on DNA vaccines, live attenuated recombinant measles vaccines, inactivated viral vaccines, subunit vaccines, and the vaccines developed by codon-optimization (<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Coronavirus, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the academic institutes like National Institute of Immunology (NII), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) New Delhi, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), etc. are attempting to develop the vaccines, and therapies, and the SARS-CoV-2 animal models to restrain the pandemic shortly (<xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">Nandi, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0360">The need of the hour is to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine which can induce an appropriate immune response to terminate this pandemic. It is the universal priority to spot the international funding mechanisms to support the development, manufacturing, and stockpiling of the coronavirus vaccines. This pandemic should serve as the guidepost to the international research community to not only acknowledge the outbreak but also indurate the following coronavirus crossing into mammals. A pan-coronavirus vaccine is urgently needed as the delay of vaccine rollout even by one week will accompany millions of deaths. Furthermore, it appears to be a scientifically feasible task if sufficient resources are made available in due time.</p></sec><sec id="sec0135"><title>Funding Information</title><p id="par0365">This work received no specific grant from any funding agency.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="par0370">The author(s) declare that there are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>J.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sohn</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>S.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hyun</surname><given-names>J.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baek</surname><given-names>Y.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeong</surname><given-names>S.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>J.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ku</surname><given-names>N.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yeom</surname><given-names>J.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Roh</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>M.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chin</surname><given-names>B.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Y.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yong</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>H.O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>J.Y.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in Two COVID-19 Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Korea</article-title><source>J Korean Med Sci</source><volume>35</volume><issue>14, April</issue><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e149</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>J.Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sohn</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>S.H.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of convalescent plasma therapy in two covid&#x02010;19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in Korea</article-title><source>J Korean Med Sci.</source><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e149</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0015"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anon</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Countries where COVID-19 has spread</chapter-title><year>2020</year><comment>www.worldometers.info.
