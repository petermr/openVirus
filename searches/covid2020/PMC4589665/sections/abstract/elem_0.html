      <p>Infectious disease metagenomics is driven by the question: “what is causing the disease?”
         in contrast to classical metagenome studies which are guided by “what is out there?”
         In case of a novel virus, a first step to eventually establishing etiology can be
         to recover a full-length viral genome from a metagenomic sample. However, retrieval
         of a full-length genome of a divergent virus is technically challenging and can be
         time-consuming and costly. Here we discuss different assembly and fragment linkage
         strategies such as iterative assembly, motif searches, k-mer frequency profiling,
         coverage profile binning, and other strategies used to recover genomes of potential
         viral pathogens in a timely and cost-effective manner.
