      <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airway inflammation
         and/or airflow limitation due to pulmonary emphysema. Chronic bronchitis, pulmonary
         emphysema, and bronchial asthma may all be associated with airflow limitation; therefore,
         exacerbation of asthma may be associated with the pathophysiology of COPD. Furthermore,
         recent studies have suggested that the exacerbation of asthma, namely virus-induced
         asthma, may be associated with a wide variety of respiratory viruses. COPD and asthma
         have different underlying pathophysiological processes and thus require individual
         therapies. Exacerbation of both COPD and asthma, which are basically defined and diagnosed
         by clinical symptoms, is associated with a rapid decline in lung function and increased
         mortality. Similar pathogens, including human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,
         influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus, are also frequently detected
         during exacerbation of asthma and/or COPD. Immune response to respiratory viral infections,
         which may be related to the severity of exacerbation in each disease, varies in patients
         with both COPD and asthma. In this regard, it is crucial to recognize and understand
         both the similarities and differences of clinical features in patients with COPD and/or
         asthma associated with respiratory viral infections, especially in the exacerbative
         stage. In relation to definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology, this review aims
         to summarize current knowledge concerning exacerbation of both COPD and asthma by
         focusing on the clinical significance of associated respiratory virus infections.
