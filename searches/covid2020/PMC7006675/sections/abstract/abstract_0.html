      <p>Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a severe respiratory
         disease in humans. The MERS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein mediates viral entry into target
         cells. For this, MERS-CoV S engages the host cell protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4,
         CD26) and the interface between MERS-CoV S and DPP4 has been resolved on the atomic
         level. Here, we asked whether naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4, that alter
         amino acid residues required for MERS-CoV S binding, influence cellular entry of MERS-CoV.
         By screening of public databases, we identified fourteen such polymorphisms. Introduction
         of the respective mutations into DPP4 revealed that all except one (Δ346-348) were
         compatible with robust DPP4 expression. Four polymorphisms (K267E, K267N, A291P and
         Δ346-348) strongly reduced binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4 and S protein-driven host
         cell entry, as determined using soluble S protein and S protein bearing rhabdoviral
         vectors, respectively. Two polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context
         of authentic MERS-CoV and were found to attenuate viral replication. Collectively,
         we identified naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4 that negatively impact cellular
         entry of MERS-CoV and might thus modulate MERS development in infected patients.
