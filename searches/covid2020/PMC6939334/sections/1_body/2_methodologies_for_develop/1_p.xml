<p id="Par69">Human, humanized, chimeric, and murine antibodies respectively account for 51, 34.7, 12.5, and 2.8% of all mAbs in clinical use, making human and humanized mAbs the dominant modalities in the field of therapeutic antibodies. In the next section, we first introduce techniques for antibody humanization. Then, we describe three technical platforms related to the generation of fully human antibodies, including phage display, transgenic mice and single B cell antibody isolation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Last, we describe the use of an affinity maturation method to optimize antibody binding activity.
