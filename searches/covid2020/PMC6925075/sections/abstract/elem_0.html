      <p>Today’s world is characterized by increasing population density, human mobility, urbanization,
         and climate and ecological change. This global dynamic has various effects, including
         the increased appearance of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), which pose a growing
         threat to global health security.
      </p>
      <p>Outbreaks of EIDs, like the 2013–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa or the current
         Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), have not only put populations
         in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) at risk in terms of morbidity and mortality,
         but they also have had a significant impact on economic growth in affected regions
         and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) is an innovative global
         partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organizations
         that was launched as the result of a consensus that a coordinated, international,
         and intergovernmental plan was needed to develop and deploy new vaccines to prevent
         future epidemics.
      </p>
      <p>CEPI is focusing on supporting candidate vaccines against the World Health Organization
         (WHO) Blueprint priority pathogens MERS-CoV, Nipah virus, Lassa fever virus, and Rift
         Valley fever virus, as well as Chikungunya virus, which is on the WHO watch list.
         The current vaccine portfolio contains a wide variety of technologies, ranging across
         recombinant viral vectors, nucleic acids, and recombinant proteins. To support and
         accelerate vaccine development, CEPI will also support science projects related to
         the development of biological standards and assays, animal models, epidemiological
         studies, and diagnostics, as well as build capacities for future clinical trials in
         risk-prone contexts.
