      <p>Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are extremely common especially in the first year
         of life. Knowledge of the etiology of a RTI is essential to facilitate the appropriate
         management and the implementation of the most effective control measures. This perspective
         explains why laboratory methods that can identify pathogens in respiratory secretions
         have been developed over the course of many years. High-complexity multiplex panel
         assays that can simultaneously detect up to 20 viruses and up to four bacteria within
         a few hours have been marketed. However, are these platforms actually useful in pediatric
         clinical practice? In this manuscript, we showed that these platforms appear to be
         particularly important for epidemiological studies and clinical research. On the contrary,
         their routine use in pediatric clinical practice remains debatable. They can be used
         only in the hospital as they require specific equipment and laboratory technicians
         with considerable knowledge, training, and experience. Moreover, despite more sensitive
         and specific than other tests routinely used for respiratory pathogen identification,
         they do not offer significantly advantage for detection of the true etiology of a
         respiratory disease. Furthermore, knowledge of which virus is the cause of a respiratory
         disease is not useful from a therapeutic point of view unless influenza virus or respiratory
         syncytial virus are the infecting agents as effective drugs are available only for
         these pathogens. On the other hand, multiplex platforms can be justified in the presence
         of severe clinical manifestations, and in immunocompromised patients for whom specific
         treatment option can be available, particularly when they can be used simultaneously
         with platforms that allow identification of antimicrobial resistance to commonly used
         drugs. It is highly likely that these platforms, particularly those with high sensitivity
         and specificity and with low turnaround time, will become essential when new drugs
         effective and safe against most of the respiratory viruses will be available. Further
         studies on how to differentiate carriers from patients with true disease, as well
         as studies on the implications of coinfections and identification of antimicrobial
         resistance, are warranted.
