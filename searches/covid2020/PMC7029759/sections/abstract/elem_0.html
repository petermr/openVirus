      <p>A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory
         viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment
         and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled
         with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should
         be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection,
         despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential
         death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with
         an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective
         therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing
         neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting
         the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally,
         I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant
         to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that
         blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting
         enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing
         antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit
         the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement
         decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute
         respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence
         of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in
         recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients
         under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a
         treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and
         widely available in the coming months to year(s).
