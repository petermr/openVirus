      <p>With rising population numbers, anthropogenic changes to our environment and unprecedented
         global connectivity, the World Economic Forum ranks the spread of infectious diseases
         second only to water crises in terms of potential global impact. Addressing the diverse
         challenges to human health and well-being in the 21st century requires an overarching
         focus on ‘Planetary Health’, with input from all sectors of government, non-governmental
         organisations, academic institutions and industry. To clarify and advance the Planetary
         Health agenda within Australia, specifically in relation to emerging infectious diseases
         (EID) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), national experts and key stakeholders were
         invited to a facilitated workshop. EID themes identified included animal reservoirs,
         targeted surveillance, mechanisms of emergence and the role of unrecognised human
         vectors (the ‘invisible man’) in the spread of infection. Themes related to AMR included
         antimicrobial use in production and companion animals, antimicrobial stewardship,
         novel treatment approaches and education of professionals, politicians and the general
         public. Effective infection control strategies are important in both EID and AMR.
         We provide an overview of key discussion points, as well as important barriers identified
         and solutions proposed.
