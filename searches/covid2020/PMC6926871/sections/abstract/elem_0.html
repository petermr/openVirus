      <p>A scoping search and a systematic literature review were conducted to give an insight
         on entry and exit screening referring to travelers at points of entry, by analyzing
         published evidence on practices, guidelines, and experiences in the past 15 years
         worldwide. Grey literature, PubMed. and Scopus were searched using specific terms.
         Most of the available data identified through the systematic literature review concerned
         entry screening measures at airports. Little evidence is available about entry and
         exit screening measure implementation and effectiveness at ports and ground crossings.
         Exit screening was part of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) temporary recommendations
         for implementation in certain points of entry, for specific time periods. Exit screening
         measures for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the three most affected West African countries
         did not identify any cases and showed zero sensitivity and very low specificity. The
         percentages of confirmed cases identified out of the total numbers of travelers that
         passed through entry screening measures in various countries worldwide for Influenza
         Pandemic (H1N1) and EVD in West Africa were zero or extremely low. Entry screening
         measures for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) did not detect any confirmed
         SARS cases in Australia, Canada, and Singapore. Despite the ineffectiveness of entry
         and exit screening measures, authors reported several important concomitant positive
         effects that their impact is difficult to assess, including discouraging travel of
         ill persons, raising awareness, and educating the traveling public and maintaining
         operation of flights from/to the affected areas. Exit screening measures in affected
         areas are important and should be applied jointly with other measures including information
         strategies, epidemiological investigation, contact tracing, vaccination, and quarantine
         to achieve a comprehensive outbreak management response. Based on review results,
         an algorithm about decision-making for entry/exit screening was developed.
