      <p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), under the EU enlargement
         policy, has supported national efforts of Western Balkan countries to strengthen their
         communicable disease prevention and control systems. The new EU strategy “A credible
         enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans” advocates
         transformation processes that will build the foundation of EU-oriented national reforms.
         Well-functioning public health microbiology laboratories are key for early detection
         and control of infectious diseases, and thus maintaining and enhancing health security
         in Europe. In order to help Western Balkan countries to improve their national capacities,
         ECDC facilitated needs assessments and identified key areas for advancement toward
         effective public health microbiology systems. Countries identified gaps in their laboratory
         data reporting and exchange systems. Harmonized and effective procedures for handling
         of highly contagious agents and cross-border transportation of biological samples
         were often lacking, as well as the systematic use of diagnostic testing at the primary
         care level or referral of patients, in particular for detection of antimicrobial resistance.
         There is a clear need to address the financial investment required for sustaining
         sufficient numbers of skilled laboratory workforce, laboratory supplies, and the development
         of new methods and techniques, including investment in emerging laboratory technologies,
         such as molecular typing by whole genome sequencing. This article highlights the key
         areas for investing in public health microbiology laboratories in Western Balkan countries
         needed to strengthen health security in Europe.
