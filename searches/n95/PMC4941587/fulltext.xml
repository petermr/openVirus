<bold>Background&#x02002;</bold> We compared the efficacy of medical masks, N95 respirators (fit tested and non fit tested), in health care workers (HCWs).</p><p>
<bold>Methods&#x02002;</bold> A cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 1441 HCWs in 15 Beijing hospitals was performed during the 2008/2009 winter. Participants wore masks or respirators during the entire work shift for 4&#x02003;weeks. Outcomes included clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza&#x02010;like illness (ILI), laboratory&#x02010;confirmed respiratory virus infection and influenza. A convenience no&#x02010;mask/respirator group of 481 health workers from nine hospitals was compared.</p><p>
<bold>Findings&#x02002;</bold> The rates of CRI (3&#x000b7;9% versus 6&#x000b7;7%), ILI (0&#x000b7;3% versus 0&#x000b7;6%), laboratory&#x02010;confirmed respiratory virus (1&#x000b7;4% versus 2&#x000b7;6%) and influenza (0&#x000b7;3% versus 1%) infection were consistently lower for the N95 group compared to medical masks. By intention&#x02010;to&#x02010;treat analysis, when <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted for clustering, non&#x02010;fit&#x02010;tested N95 respirators were significantly more protective than medical masks against CRI, but no other outcomes were significant. The rates of all outcomes were higher in the convenience no&#x02010;mask group compared to the intervention arms. There was no significant difference in outcomes between the N95 arms with and without fit testing. Rates of fit test failure were low. In a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis adjusted for potential confounders, N95 masks and hospital level were significant, but medical masks, vaccination, handwashing and high&#x02010;risk procedures were not.</p><p>
<bold>Interpretation&#x02002;</bold> Rates of infection in the medical mask group were double that in the N95 group. A benefit of respirators is suggested but would need to be confirmed by a larger trial, as this study may have been underpowered. The finding on fit testing is specific to the type of respirator used in the study and cannot be generalized to other respirators.</p><p>

</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of medical masks compared to fit&#x02010;tested and non&#x02010;fit&#x02010;tested N95 respirators in HCWs in the prevention of disease because of influenza and other respiratory viruses.</p></sec><sec id="ss2"><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective, cluster randomized trial of medical mask and respirator use in frontline HCWs was conducted from December 2008 to January 2009 in Beijing, China. We initially aimed to determine the efficacy of two different kinds of respiratory protection (N95 respirators and medical masks) during the influenza season compared to each other and compared to a no&#x02010;mask group. However, although we intended to have a randomized control group, this was not acceptable to the Chinese IRB, who felt it would be unethical to assign HCWs randomly to not wear a mask, given mask use was widespread in Chinese hospitals that were included in the randomization. As such, we studied a convenience&#x02010;selected no&#x02010;mask group of HCWs who did not wear a mask. These HCWs were selected from other hospitals where mask wearing was not routine during the study period. Absence of randomization in the no&#x02010;mask group meant that we eventually had to restrict the primary analysis of the trial to the comparison of the efficacy of N95 respirators and medical masks with each other.</p><p>Participants were hospital HCWs aged &#x02265;18&#x02003;years from the emergency departments and respiratory wards of 15 hospitals. These wards were selected as high&#x02010;risk settings in which repeated and multiple exposures to respiratory infections are expected. We also monitored all participating wards by active surveillance for clinically compatible illness, including in the no&#x02010;mask group, for outbreaks of respiratory infection in patients during the study period, and none was detected. All hospitals were large, tertiary hospitals in urban Beijing, and there was no variation in the start of the influenza season within this geographic area.</p><p>Recruitment commenced on the 1 December 2008 and final follow&#x02010;up was completed on 15 January 2009. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Research Ethics Committee of the Beijing Ministry for Health. Verbal informed consent was provided by participants, and they were provided written information about the study.</p><p>The nine hospitals in the convenience no&#x02010;arm group were not part of the randomization, but HCWs in those hospitals were selected from the same type of wards as the intervention arms (emergency departments and respiratory wards). They were followed up in the same way as the trial participants for development of infections.</p><sec id="ss3"><title>Randomization and intervention</title><p>The unit of randomization was hospitals. Hospitals were randomized to one of three intervention arms: (i) Medical masks (3M&#x02122; medical mask, catalogue number 1820, St Paul, MN, USA); (ii) N95 fit&#x02010;tested mask (3M&#x02122; flat&#x02010;fold N95 respirator, catalogue number 9132) and (iii) N95 non&#x02010;fit&#x02010;tested mask (3M&#x02122; flat&#x02010;fold N95 respirator, catalogue number 9132). <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> outlines the recruitment and randomization (using a secure computerized randomization program) process. A pre&#x02010;study assessment of hospital infection control levels determined that the hospitals had sufficient diversity to warrant stratified randomization by size of hospital and level of infection control. This assessment measured ventilation, spatial dimensions, bedding configuration, handwashing facilities and personal protective equipment use. The Ministry of Health in 1989 categorizes hospitals in China into three levels (Level 3 is the highest) depending on their level of sophistication, equipment and staff/bed numbers. Fifteen hospitals were randomized &#x02013; five level 2 and ten level 3.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>&#x02002;Consort Diagram of recruitment and follow&#x02010;up.</p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-1" xlink:href="IRV-5-170-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>Primary endpoints</title><p>(i) Clinical respiratory illness (CRI),<xref rid="b19" ref-type="ref">

Also, all respiratory pathogens share a similar transmission mechanism namely aerosol, droplet and fomite spread, although the relative role of these factors may vary between different viruses and in different clinical situations. Other endpoints included adverse effects, measured using a semi&#x02010;structured questionnaire and adherence.</p></sec><sec id="ss5"><title>Eligibility</title><p>Any nurse, doctor or ward clerk who worked full time in the emergency or respiratory wards at the hospital were eligible. HCWs were excluded if they: (i) were unable or refused to consent; (ii) had beards, long moustaches or long facial hair stubble; (iii) had a current respiratory illness, rhinitis and/or allergy and (iv) worked part&#x02010;time or did not work in the aforementioned wards/departments. In all participating wards, 100% of eligible health workers participated.</p></sec><sec id="ss6"><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants wore the mask or respirator on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks after being shown when to wear it and how to fit it correctly. Participants were supplied daily with either three masks for the medical mask group or two N95 respirators. Participants were asked to store the mask in a paper bag every time they removed it (for toilet breaks, tea/lunch breaks and at the end of every shift) and place the bagged mask or respirator in their locker. All participants were instructed on the importance of hand hygiene prior to/after the removal of medical masks and respirators. Participants in arm two underwent a fit&#x02010;testing procedure using a 3M&#x02122; FT&#x02010;30 Bitrex Fit Test kit according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions (3M&#x02122;, St Paul, MN, USA).</p><p>Detailed demographic and clinical details of all participants were collected. This included age, sex, smoking history, comorbidities, seasonal influenza vaccination status, medications, conduct of high&#x02010;risk procedures (defined as suctioning, intubation, nebulized medications, chest physiotherapy and other aerosol generating procedures), handwashing practices, use of other personal protective equipment (gowns, gloves, eye shields and hair/foot covers) and results of laboratory tests. Use of specific interventions for influenza such as antivirals was also measured.</p></sec><sec id="ss7"><title>Follow&#x02010;up</title><p>Participants were followed for 4&#x02003;weeks of wearing the masks or respirators and an extra week of non&#x02010;wearing for development of respiratory symptoms.</p><p>All participants received a mercury thermometer to measure their temperature at the beginning of each day and at the onset of any symptoms. Diary cards were provided for the duration to record daily the (i) number of hours worked; (ii) mask/respirator usage and (iii) recognized CRI encounters.</p><p>Participants were contacted daily by phone or face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face contact to actively identify incident cases of respiratory infection. At each ward, the head nurse actively followed up all participants and identified incident illness. Staff members from the District CDC also undertook daily monitoring of the sites. If participants were symptomatic, swabs of both tonsils and the posterior pharyngeal wall were collected.</p><p>We also monitored adherence with mask or respirator use over the 4&#x02010;week time course by: (i) observation: the head ward nurse observed compliance on the ward on a daily basis and recorded the information on a structured form, (ii) self&#x02010;report: a diary card with tick boxes was given to each subject, to be carried during the day. Adherence to wearing the masks or respirators was monitored by these diary cards and returned to researchers on a weekly basis. Exit interviews with participants were conducted after the 4&#x02003;weeks to gain further insights into adherence and other issues around the use of masks/respirators including adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="ss8"><title>Sample collection and laboratory testing</title><p>Participants with symptoms had two pharyngeal swabs collected by a trained nurse or doctor. Double rayon&#x02010;tipped, plastic&#x02010;shafted swabs were used to scratch both tonsilar areas and the posterior pharyngeal wall. These were transported immediately after collection to the laboratory, or at 4&#x000b0;C within 48&#x02003;hours if transport was delayed.</p><p>Pharyngeal swabs were tested with at the Laboratories of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Viral DNA/RNA was extracted from 300&#x02003;&#x003bc;l of each respiratory specimen using the Viral Gene&#x02010;spin<sup>TM</sup> kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc., Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed on 8&#x02003;&#x003bc;l of RNA in a final reaction volume of 20&#x02003;&#x003bc;l for 1&#x000b7;5&#x02003;hours at 37&#x000b0;C, using the RevertAid<sup>TM</sup> First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) to synthesize cDNA. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using the Seeplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> RV12 Detection kit (Seegen, Inc., Seoul, Korea) to detect adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 or 3, influenza viruses A or B, respiratory syncytial virus A or B, rhinovirus A/B and coronavirus OC43/HKU1. Three microlitres of synthesized first&#x02010;strand cDNA, 4&#x02003;&#x003bc;l of multiplex primers, 10&#x02003;&#x003bc;l master mix (hot start <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase and dNTP are included in the reaction buffer) and 3&#x02003;&#x003bc;l of 8&#x02010;methoxypsoralen (8&#x02010;MOP) were added (8&#x02010;MOP, accompanied by UV irradiation for 20&#x02003;minutes, prevents amplification of contaminated DNA). A mixture of 12 viral clones was used as a positive control template, and sterile deionized water was used as a negative control. After preheating at 95&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02003;minutes, 40 amplification cycles were carried out under the following conditions in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR system 9700, Foster City, CA, USA): 94&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02003;seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000b7;5&#x02003;minutes and 72&#x000b0;C for 1&#x000b7;5&#x02003;minutes. Amplification was completed at the final extension step at 72&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02003;minutes. The multiplex PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide&#x02010;stained 2% agarose gel. Viral isolation by MDCK cell culture was undertaken for some of the influenza samples which were positive by nuclei acid detection. Specimen processing, DNA/RNA extraction, PCR amplification and PCR product analyses were conducted in different rooms to avoid cross&#x02010;contamination.</p></sec><sec id="ss9"><title>Analysis</title><p>The primary endpoints of interest as described above were analysed by intention&#x02010;to&#x02010;treat analysis. The two N95 arms were also combined and compared to the medical mask arm, given that there was no significant difference between them and rates of fit test failure were extremely low in the fit&#x02010;tested arm (5/461 fit test failures). Differences in proportions between the trial arms were tested by calculation of Pearson&#x02019;s chi&#x02010;square using <sc>sas</sc> 9.2 software (Cary, NC, USA). The distribution of key potentially confounding variables between study arms was compared. To estimate the odds ratio while adjusting for the clustering effects, we used a random effect logistic regression model. In the model, we added a hospital&#x02010;specific random intercept in the linear predictors, and maximum likelihood was estimated using adaptive quadrature.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="ref">

However, only the N95 non&#x02010;fit&#x02010;tested arm was significantly protective against CRI, and there were no other significant differences between N95 respirators and medical masks for the four primary outcomes in the adjusted analysis. However, it should be noted that under the null hypothesis where there is no difference between groups, the probability that we wrongly find at least one significant difference given the 12 tests undertaken is 46%. The trial may also be underpowered because observed attack rates were lower than expected.</p><p>The rates of all outcomes were higher in the convenience no&#x02010;mask group than in the masks groups. By adjusted intention&#x02010;to&#x02010;treat analysis, N95 respirators but not medical masks had significantly lower rates of infection compared to no masks. However, the convenience no&#x02010;mask group was not a randomized control arm and hospitals in this group were actually selected on the basis that most of their staff did not wear masks (which is not the norm in hospitals in Beijing), suggesting that conditions in those hospitals were different than those in hospitals from the masks groups. As a consequence, it is not possible to make any definitive judgement on the efficacy of masks on this basis. One possible bias would be if those hospitals had differentially higher risk of infection compared to the intervention hospitals, for example because of the occurrence of outbreaks. However, we monitored all hospitals involved in the study for outbreaks which may have increased apparent attack rates, and none were documented. Other than that, possible sources of bias that could have plausibly increased the infection rate in the control arm (namely vaccination, handwashing, hospital level and high&#x02010;risk procedures) were measured. In a <italic>post hoc</italic> adjusted analysis, only hospital level and the N95 arm were significant against CRI and laboratory&#x02010;confirmed viral infection.</p><p>Respiratory protection is a key strategy for pandemic control and key to sustaining the health care workforce. The fact that rates of all outcomes were consistently lower in the N95 group suggest that N95 respirators might offer better protection for HCWs; but a larger trial is needed to make a definitive judgment about the relative efficacy of respirators and medical masks. A recent, smaller trial found no difference between N95 and medical masks, but was probably underpowered to detect any differences.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="ref">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> Further, the intervention in that study was use of respiratory protection only during care of identified febrile patients with ILI or high&#x02010;risk procedures. This is different from the intervention in our study, which comprised wearing the mask for the entire shift. In addition, that study measured serological evidence of influenza as an outcome, which comprised the majority of outcomes, but did not exclude influenza&#x02010;vaccinated participants, a flaw that would have resulted in false&#x02010;positive cases of &#x02018;influenza&#x02019;.</p><p>The finding that fit testing did not improve the efficacy of N95 respirators is important, although it could be explained by a lack of power. The value of fit testing varies with the quality of the respirator, and our study used a high&#x02010;quality respirator. These results would not be generalizable to other respirators, where fit testing may be more important. As such, we still recommend that fit testing be part of the process of using respirators.</p><p>The small number of randomization units along with the small numbers of cases means that estimation of multivariate models would not necessarily converge. In the <italic>post hoc</italic> multivariable analysis, we could not adjust for all of the factors because of high correlation among some of them.</p><p>Other limitations of the study include the generalizability of our results to other types of respirators and to other HCW populations in other countries. Scoping work with Australian HCWs showed compliance of 10% with continual mask wearing during a severe influenza season.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="ref">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref> Beijing was selected to maximize the power of the study because of the strong culture of mask wearing among HCWs. Another limitation of the study is that cluster RCTs can be impacted by heterogeneity of behaviours, meaning that we cannot exclude such effects caused by behaviours we did not measure. The cluster design is also strength, as interventions against infectious diseases can have herd effects. In infectious diseases which can spread from person to person, the &#x02018;herd effect&#x02019; is a real and documented phenomenon where protecting some individuals with an intervention (most commonly vaccination, but also applicable to other interventions) can also protect individuals who were not protected by the intervention. Therefore, if some individuals are randomized to masks on a ward, the individuals who do not wear masks may also be protected because of the effect the masks have on interrupting the transmission of disease from person to person. This is why it is preferable to use cluster design, where everyone in the cluster gets the same intervention.</p><p>In our study, masks or respirators were worn during the entire shift. Some policies recommend mask/respirator use only when HCWs are conducting high&#x02010;risk procedures or entering an isolation room. Whether masks/respirators will be protective when used only when an identified episode of exposure occurs depends on whether HCWs accurately identify all episodes of risk, whether most transmission occurs after clearly identified exposures and whether there is transmission from asymptomatic or pre&#x02010;symptomatic infections. There is currently no evidence on how much of a HCWs&#x02019; risk is unidentified or unrecognized. In our study, HCWs who conducted high&#x02010;risk procedures had higher rates of CRI, but not of laboratory&#x02010;confirmed pathogens or influenza. Further clinical research is required to determine the efficacy of continuous versus targeted mask use.</p><p>Until now, public health policy for dealing with pandemics has relied heavily on data from a modest number of often old and inadequate studies. Data from the SARS outbreak showed that masks reduced transmission of SARS and other viral respiratory infections.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="ref">

</xref> During SARS, the use of N95 respirators and medical masks was the major protective infection control measure.<xref rid="b27" ref-type="ref">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref> However, the relative contribution of each type or the difference between N95 respirators and medical masks cannot clearly be determined from observational data.</p><p>Problems with adherence to mask/respirator use are also a potential problem. We showed that in Australia, less than half of parents who were randomized to wear a medical mask or respirator while their child was ill adhered with mask wearing.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="ref">

<sup>10</sup>
</xref> with higher rates in the N95 group, but it did not affect their adherence with mask/respirator wearing. This suggests that discomfort is not the primary driver of adherence, and rather, cultural acceptability and other behavioural factors may be the main reason for non&#x02010;adherence. The past experience of Beijing health workers with SARS may also be a factor in the high adherence. This level of adherence may not translate to Western cultural contexts in a normal winter season, especially for N95 respirators; however, adherence can change with perception of risk. During a pandemic, we would expect HCWs to have higher adherence to infection control measures. In summary, our study adds evidence on the use of respiratory protection for HCWs, but highlights the need for larger trials and comparison of different policy options.</p></sec><sec id="ss14"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Professor C.
