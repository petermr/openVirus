Respiratory viral infections among healthcare workers can negatively impact delivery of healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>United States national guidelines call for modes of transmission to dictate infection control measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For most human respiratory viruses, the precise mode(s) of person-to-person transmission is incompletely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The predominant mode of transmission for some human respiratory pathogens, such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus is believed to be <italic>droplet transmission. Airborne transmission</italic> plays a role with some human respiratory pathogens via small aerosol particles, often called droplet nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Airborne transmission is the predominant mode of transmission for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and recent evidence has suggested a larger role than previously thought for Influenza A and B viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Disposable respiratory protective devices (RPD) that fit tightly to the wearer&#x02019;s face, sometimes called air-purifying respirators or filtering facepiece respirators, are primarily designed to <italic>protect the wearer</italic> against infection spread by ill patients. N95 filtering facepiece respirators (commonly known as &#x0201c;N95 respirators&#x0201d;) are one type of RPD capable, with proper facial fit and usage, of reducing inhalation of airborne particulates by a factor of 10 or greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Medical masks (MM), typically called surgical masks in operative settings, are primarily devised to <italic>protect patients</italic> against infection spread by the wearer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Both types of devices also serve as a physical barrier keeping sprays and splashes of infectious materials and contaminated hands and objects away from oronasal region of wearer. Although RPD and MM are capable of filtering particulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], RPD are designed to filter smaller particulates that may remain airborne for long periods. A tight seal between the respirator and the wearer&#x02019;s face is designed to prevent leakage of particulates, a feature not provided by loose-fitting MM. The U.S. Department of Labor&#x02019;s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to ensure each HCP, who may be exposed to airborne-transmissible infections in the workplace, receives an RPD with an adequate respirator-to-face seal that is determined during a mandated annual &#x0201c;fit-test&#x0201d;.</p><p>However, evidence is inconclusive that RPD are better than MM at protecting HCPs from respiratory infections in clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], despite tight-fitting RPD produced by manufacturers, with higher levels of exposure reduction validated by numerous laboratory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and the use of a complete respiratory protection program (e.g., training, initial and annual fit test) as defined by OSHA to protect HCP. Intuitively, RPD should better protect HCP against airborne infections than MM, but objective evidence has not validated this supposition. One possibility that may explain this discrepancy between expectations and observations is pragmatic: HCP, in general, do not tolerate N95 respirators as well as medical masks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], perhaps prompting them to remove respirators more frequently and/or for longer periods, increasing the likelihood of exposure to infections. Models have shown that 25&#x000a0;% or more non-wear time during exposure negates any significant differences in protective ability between types of RPDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given the difficulty with HCP adherence to guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and general dissatisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] with RPD, medical masks worn more consistently may provide similar levels of reduction in respiratory viral disease transmission as N95 respirators.</p><p>This key gap in knowledge has contributed to discrepant clinical and public health recommendations about respiratory protection for HCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Therefore, in addition to RPDs, filtration testing was done on medical masks prior to enrollment of subjects to ensure consistency between models across study locations. The filtration performance of the N95 respirators and medical mask models in the study were tested in a manner similar to that used by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Devices were attached to a test fixture and placed in a TSI 8130 automated filter tester operated with an air flow rate of 85 liters per minute. The TSI 8130 uses a photometer to measure the flux of light scattering from aerosol particles. Polydispersed particles (mass median diameter of ~0.3 microns) were generated from a 2&#x000a0;% NaCl solution and passed through each device being tested for 1&#x000a0;min. Each test was repeated 3 times with a fresh N95 respirator or medical mask. To be certified as an N95 respirator, filter penetration needs to be less than 5&#x000a0;% (or 95&#x000a0;% efficient). As shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the average penetration percentages for the NIOSH certified N95 respirators were an order of magnitude lower than those of medical masks, which are not NIOSH certified.

The attack rate laboratory-confirmed influenza during a single study season is assumed to be 20&#x000a0;% among unvaccinated individuals in the medical mask group. We assume 65&#x000a0;% of our population will be administered a vaccine that is 65&#x000a0;% effective in preventing influenza infection. Vaccine effectiveness at the higher end of published reports (86&#x000a0;% in health care workers) will lead to a reduction in the yearly attack rate to approximately 8.8&#x000a0;%, and effectiveness at the lower end of published reports (51&#x000a0;% in the general population) would lead to an increased yearly attack rate of approximately 13.4&#x000a0;%. Importantly, the anticipated effect on the needed sample size of annual variations in influenza incidence is larger than the expected impact of variation in vaccine effectiveness.</p><p>The ResPECT study will need 157 independent clusters with a median size of 16 participants each to achieve 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a relative risk of 0.75 between N95 and surgical masks at preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, with a Type-I error rate of 0.05. The total number of individuals participating each season will need to be approximately 2506, with 10,024 total person-seasons accumulating over the multi-year study. For the secondary outcome of laboratory confirmed respiratory illness, the estimated total number of clinics will need to be 80, the total number of individuals participating each season will need to be 1276, and total person-seasons accumulated need to be 5104 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) over the multi-year study.

Healthcare-associated infections cost $10B annually in U.S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Factors influencing transmission of respiratory infections in healthcare facilities include the population density of ill patients in healthcare settings, the types of exposures within healthcare settings, the administrative and physical structures of healthcare facilities, and intrinsic characteristics of virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Measures to prevent transmission within healthcare facilities include HCP vaccination, hand-hygiene, cleaning and disinfection of inanimate surfaces, pre- and post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis, patient isolation, and personal protective equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. ResPECT is designed to better understand the extent to which PPE, specifically represented by differences in exposure reduction afforded by N95s and MMs, reduces clinical illness among HCPs.</p><p>While it may seem that N95 respirators should better protect HCPs than MM against airborne infections in the workplace, this notion has not been validated by objective clinical evidence. Low tolerance to respirator wear among HCPs may prompt more frequent or longer periods of removal, compared to MM, to an extent that the benefits of higher levels of filtration and lower levels of leakage around the facial seal afforded by respirators is offset or subjugated.</p><p>Key sources of variability in HCP health outcomes are difficult to control for, even in a rigorously designed clinical study such as ResPECT. For example, the inability to prevent HCP community exposures to respiratory infections and the inherent year-to-year variation of viral respiratory infections provide a challenging setting in which to evaluate the effectiveness of personal protective equipment. While community-acquired infections may pose a significant source of exposure for HCPs, this type of exposure, if occurring non-differentially between study arms, would bias the results from ResPECT towards the null hypothesis.</p><p>Key reasons for choosing a cluster-randomized design are (a) to increase compliance by equipping all members of a healthcare team with the same equipment and (b) to capture indirect effects of the intervention at the cluster-level, such as herd immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>A fully successful study would produce clinically relevant results that help clinician-leaders make reasoned decisions about protection of HCPs against occupationally acquired respiratory infections and prevention of spread within healthcare systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ARI, acute respiratory illness; CDC, centers for disease control and prevention; DSMB, data safety monitoring board; HAI, hemagglutination inhibition antibody; HCP, healthcare personnel; ILI, influenza like illness; LCRI, Laboratory confirmed respiratory illness; MM, medical mask; N95, N95 respirator; NIOSH, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; OSHA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration; PPE, occupational protective equipment; ResPECT, respiratory protection effectiveness clinical trial; RPD, respiratory protective devices; RT-PCR, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; US, United States.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the members of the ResPECT Team (complete list to be provided prior to publication).
