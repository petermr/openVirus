The other two published HCW RCTs used a more specific and less sensitive definition of influenza based on nucleic acid testing (NAT) of respiratory specimens in symptomatic subjects. As such, even these substantially larger RCTs were unable to demonstrate any significant difference in influenza infection between N95 respirators and medical masks.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Finally, a recent study examined the efficacy of cloth masks compared to medical mask and control groups, and found that cloth masks may increase the risk of infection in HCWs.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>
</p><p>Guidelines for respiratory protection have been driven by presumed transmission mode alone, and under an assumption that influenza and other pathogens are spread by one mode alone.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> However, the paradigm of unimodal droplet or airborne spread is based on outmoded experiments from the 1940s, which concluded that only large droplets are found at close proximity to the patient, while small droplet nuclei and airborne particles are found at a longer distance.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> It has since been shown that both small and large particles can exist at short distances from the patient, and that aerosolised transmission can occur at close proximity.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>
</p><p>In our two published RCTs conducted in China,<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> we used the same outcomes, case definitions and measurement tools, and used the same testing methods for a range of different pathogens transmitted by different routes. This afforded an opportunity to pool the data from both trials for improved statistical power to examine the outcomes by pathogens and mode of transmission. The aim of this pooled analysis was to examine the efficacy of medical masks and respirators in HCWs against respiratory infection.</p></sec><sec id="irv12474-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>METHODS</title><p>We pooled the results of our two RCTs on mask and respirator use in hospital HCWs in Beijing, China. The first RCT (Trial 1) was conducted from December 2008 to January 2009,<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> and included 1441 HCWs randomised to: medical mask arm (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;492), N95 fit&#x02010;tested arm (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;461) and N95 non&#x02010;fit&#x02010;tested arm (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;488). The rate of fit&#x02010;test failure was very low (5/461) in this trial, so data from both N95 arms were combined for analysis.</p><p>An additional 481 healthcare workers from nine hospitals were recruited to a control arm. These hospitals were purposefully selected as they indicated low levels of routine mask/respirator use during a pre&#x02010;trial assessment. Participants in the control arms continued their usual mask wearing practices and were followed using the same protocol as applied to the other arms.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>
</p><p>The second trial (Trial 2) was conducted from 28 December 2009 to 7 February 2010, using the same design.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> In Trial 2, participants were randomised to three arms: medical masks at all times on shift (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;572), continuous N95 respirators at all times on shift (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;516) and targeted/intermittent use of N95 respirators only while doing high&#x02010;risk procedures or barrier nursing of a patient with known respiratory illness (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;521). Fit testing was not performed in the second RCT. In both trials, participants were followed for 4&#x000a0;weeks of wearing the medical masks or respirators, and an extra week of non&#x02010;wearing of masks for the development of symptoms. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including gender, age, smoking, vaccination status, pre&#x02010;existing medical illnesses, hand hygiene and high&#x02010;risk procedures. Pharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic participants, and samples were tested at the laboratories of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There was no major difference in the products used in both clinical trials. In the first trial, we used medical masks (3M, catalogue number 1820) and N95 fit/non&#x02010;fit&#x02010;tested respirator (3M, catalogue number 9132). The following products were used in the second trial: medical masks (3M, catalogue number 1817) and respirator (3M, catalogue number 1860).</p><p>The interventions compared in the pooled analysis were as follows: (i) continuous use of N95 respirators (pooled data from both trials &#x02010; 1530 subjects); (ii) targeted N95 respirator use (data from trial 2&#x02010;516 subjects); (iii) continuous use of medical masks (pooled data from both trials &#x02010; 1064 subjects) and (iv) and a control group (data from trial 1&#x02010;481 subjects).</p><p>Only laboratory&#x02010;confirmed outcomes were included in the analysis, which were defined and measured identically in both trials, and comprised: (i) laboratory&#x02010;confirmed viral respiratory infection (detection of adenoviruses; human metapneumovirus; coronavirus 229E &#x02044; NL63; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3; influenza viruses A and B; respiratory syncytial virus A and B; rhinovirus A&#x02044;B and coronavirus OC43 &#x02044;HKU1 by multiplex PCR); (ii) laboratory&#x02010;confirmed (multiplex PCR) influenza A or B and (iii) laboratory&#x02010;confirmed bacterial colonisation (Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia).<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> The laboratory testing has previously been described.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>
</p><p>Laboratory&#x02010;confirmed bacteria and viruses identified in participants were categorised according to droplet (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;285), contact (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) and airborne (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) transmission modes (Table <xref rid="irv12474-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>A). Sixty&#x02010;one co&#x02010;infection cases with multitransmission were categorised separately. Among the viruses isolated, coronavirus and influenza A/B were included in the droplet category (and thus included in the additional analysis); rhinovirus A/B was included in the airborne category and adenovirus; parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were included in contact category in the base case analysis. All bacteria were categorised into the droplet transmission category. For consistency, data on the transmission modes were taken from the Pathogen Safety Data Sheets (PSDSs) of the Public Health Agency of Canada<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> (Table <xref rid="irv12474-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>A). As the largest number of confirmed infections was in the droplet category, we conducted a subgroup analysis of droplet&#x02010;transmitted infections.

We used a fitted fixed effect model because there are only two trials. Two studies were conducted in the same setting with similar participant characteristics, and they examined the same underlying effect. In the analysis, relative risk (RR) was estimated using the control arm as the referent category after adjusting for potential confounders and their interaction terms with a trial ID number. The overall rates of seasonal infection were higher in the second trial than the first. The consistency assumption (ie between study homogeneity) for the IPD meta&#x02010;analysis was tested by fitting an interaction term between trial ID and trial arms where a significant interaction is indicative of inconsistency.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Any interaction term (between trial ID and covariates other than trial arm) that was not a confounder was subsequently excluded from the model using backward elimination approach. This approach is described in detailed elsewhere.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> We repeated the above&#x02010;described methods for each of the outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="irv12474-sec-0010"><label>3</label><title>RESULTS</title><p>After combining the data sets from the two trials, 3591 cases were entered into the pooled analysis (1064 cases in the medical mask arm, 516 cases in the targeted N95 arm, 1530 cases in the continuous N95 arm and 481 cases in the control arm).

This suggests that transmission is more complex than assumed by traditional classifications, and supports the fact that both large and small droplets are present close to the patient, and that aerosol transmission may occur for presumed &#x0201c;droplet&#x0201d; infections. Respirators are designed to provide respiratory protection through filtration and fit, and properly fitted respirators provide better protection compared to medical masks.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> We could not demonstrate efficacy of medical masks against any outcome, but the non&#x02010;significant trend appeared to be towards protection. Medical masks may well have efficacy,<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> but if so, the degree of efficacy was too small to detect in this study, and larger studies are needed, given the widespread use of these devices in health care.</p><p>The practical implication of this research is illustrated with influenza as a case in point. Droplet and contact are thought to be primary modes of transmission for seasonal influenza; therefore, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend medical masks during routine patient care, while N95 respirators are recommended during procedures in which aerosols may be generated and during other high&#x02010;risk situations.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> However, there is increasing evidence of aerosol transmission of influenza during routine care as well (in the absence of aerosol generating procedures), which may warrant superior respiratory protection.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Influenza research is challenging because there is high seasonal variation in activity, and the level of circulating influenza in any given year cannot be predicted when planning RCTs. In addition, a diagnosis of influenza requires the detection of virus from respiratory specimens, or a fourfold rise in serological titres, both of which are highly resource&#x02010;intensive and depend on daily subject follow&#x02010;up and on optimal timing of specimen collection. For all these reasons, the published studies to date have been unable to determine whether there is a difference in efficacy against influenza infection between medical masks and N95 respirators. This study can therefore usefully inform policies for prevention of influenza.</p><p>In the first RCT, compared to medical masks, N95 respirators were found to be protective against CRI, but not against ILI or laboratory&#x02010;confirmed influenza.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> When compared with the control arm, rates of laboratory&#x02010;confirmed virus and bacterial colonisation were significantly lower in N95 arm (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="irv12474-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap">5</xref>). In the second RCT, continuous use of N95 respirators was associated with lower rates of CRI and laboratory&#x02010;confirmed bacterial colonisation compared to the medical mask use.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Pooled analysis of these studies improved the power to analyse other infectious outcomes by intervention and to allow analysis by mode of transmission.</p><p>An important finding of this analysis was the efficacy of N95 respirators against droplet&#x02010;transmitted infections. Generally, medical masks are considered sufficient for droplet&#x02010;transmitted infections such as influenza.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> However, this study has demonstrated a clear benefit of using N95 respirators (both continuous and targeted) to protect HCWs against droplet infections and does not show significant protection of medical masks. In the light of these findings, it may be prudent to use respirators when the transmission mode of a disease is unknown or when HCWs exposed to droplet&#x02010;transmitted infections with a high&#x02010;case fatality rate.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS&#x02010;CoV) and Ebola virus disease (EVD) are not airborne infections, yet the CDC recommendation of using respirators to protect HCWs recognises the uncertainty around transmission.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> The CDC initially recommended medical masks for Ebola, but changed their guidelines when US HCWs became infected, amidst unrest and challenges to the prior guidelines.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> In contrast, the WHO recommends medical masks for MERS&#x02010;CoV and Ebola <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> despite having older guidelines for filoviruses which recommended respirators.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> There is a need for a more evidence&#x02010;based approach to updating guidelines and ensuring consistency between different guidelines.<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>
</p><p>Our study also demonstrated that, over and above the benefit of continuous use, targeted use of N95 is associated with reduced risk of infection. Many guidelines recommend targeted use,<xref rid="irv12474-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="irv12474-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> and our study supports this practice. However, better protection is achieved through continuous use of respirators. This may be because HCWs cannot always identify situations in which they are at risk, especially in busy clinical settings with a high level of movement of patients and staff in and out of wards.</p><p>This study has some limitations. Firstly, the reporting of the results included in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="irv12474-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is different from the IPD meta&#x02010;analysis results. This is due to the uneven distribution of randomisation arms and differing seasonal attack rates between the trials. In Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="irv12474-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, these between&#x02010;trial differences were not taken into account. The IPD meta&#x02010;analysis takes into account of these and gives an unbiased association. Secondly, the control arm in trial 1 was not randomised; however, the risk of bias is less due to similar study setting, outcome measures and participant characteristics. Moreover, whether infection was acquired in the community or the hospital cannot be determined, but the RCT design should result in community exposure being distributed equally across all arms. Finally, we categorised pathogens according to various transmission modes, while certain viruses are transmitted via multiple routes. The pooled data were suggestive of an effect of respirators against influenza, but probably did not have enough statistical power for this outcome. The major strength of this study is the use of the same endpoints, measurements and methods in the two trials, which allowed valid pooling of the data.</p></sec><sec id="irv12474-sec-0012"><label>5</label><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>It is a long&#x02010;held belief in hospital infection control that a mask is adequate for droplet&#x02010;transmitted infections. We showed that the use of respirators provides better protection against respiratory infections, even those presumed to be spread predominantly by the droplet mode. The targeted use of a respirator was also effective, whereas no efficacy was demonstrated for medical masks alone. However, the trends suggest some degree of protection from medical masks, and larger studies are required to measure the efficacy of these devices. The superiority of respirators should be reflected in infection control guidelines to ensure the occupational health and safety of HCWs. A growing body of clinical efficacy evidence, including this study, challenges long&#x02010;held paradigms about the transmission of infection.</p></sec><sec id="irv12474-sec-0013"><label>6</label><title>SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</title><p>
