However, few studies have investigated the adverse impacts of exposure to emissions from road tunnel portals or their ventilation stacks, or the beneficial effects of diverting traffic from surface roads into tunnels. This may be due to the difficulty in designing studies that distinguish between emissions from road tunnels and emissions from general surrounding traffic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Only one study has investigated the association between exposure to emissions from a road tunnel ventilation stack and health effects. That cross-sectional study found no evidence of increased respiratory or irritant symptoms in high exposure zones compared to low exposure zones.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></p><p>Several recent studies have reported designs that may be helpful for assessing this type of exposure. Each has investigated the respiratory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4 R5 R6 R7 R8">4&#x02013;8</xref> or cardiovascular<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11 R12 R13">9&#x02013;13</xref> effects of very short-term exposures (typically 2&#x02005;h or less) to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and diesel emissions in real-world settings. All are characterised by their quasi-experimental study design in which participants were taken to locations (busy traffic, inner city with diesel only, quiet park like) or underwent realistic commutes (in buses, cars or bicycling) where the investigators expected elevated exposures or contrasts in exposures to TRAP to occur. However, these designs have not yet been applied to the assessment of new point sources, such as emissions from road tunnels and their ventilation stacks.</p><p>A proposal to build a new road tunnel in Sydney with emissions vented to the surface via ventilation stacks presented us with an opportunity to prospectively test the hypothesis that short-term exposure to emissions from the tunnel ventilation stacks has an adverse effect on respiratory health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted in Sydney, Australia between 2006 and 2008, and approved by the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) on 17 August 2006.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>The study was a randomised, controlled cross-over trial. Thirty-six volunteers were recruited through a university, student and workplace networks, and the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research's (WIMR) Volunteer Database. Eligibility criteria included nonsmokers, ability to walk easily for 2&#x02005;h, able to participate in 2006 and 2007, sense of smell not compromised and not pregnant.</p><p>Study participants were randomised into three equal-size groups, which defined the order of exposure in the cross-over study. Three exposure conditions were tested: &#x02018;downwind&#x02019; of the LCT western ventilation stack (putative adverse exposure), &#x02018;upwind&#x02019; of the stack (negative control) and a &#x02018;heavily trafficked site&#x02019; (positive control). The three exposures took place over 6&#x02005;days in October&#x02013;November in 2006, before the tunnel opened, and during the same months in 2007 and 2008, after the tunnel opened, to account for seasonal influences. Data collection extended to 2008, the second follow-up year, as it was expected that traffic volumes in the tunnel would be increased between 2007 and 2008. Traffic volumes in November 2007 and 2008 were 49 218 vehicles per day (vpd) and 58 218 vpd respectively. Each exposure comprised two morning sessions during peak traffic periods (07:00&#x02013;09:00) on two consecutive weekdays (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001201F1">figure 1</xref>). There was a 6&#x02005;day washout period between exposure conditions. The order of group allocation to exposure type was the same each year, except in 2008 where order of testing for two groups was changed twice due to changing wind conditions.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2012001201F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic of fieldwork.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="BMJOPEN2012001201f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Exposure locations</title><p>The tunnel ventilation stacks are located at its eastern and western ends, respectively. As the eastern stack is located close to tunnel feeder roads, attribution of an effect solely due to the stack would be difficult. Hence, we decided to conduct the study at sites located around the western ventilation stack using predetermined walking routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001201F2">figure 2</xref>). The heavily trafficked (positive control) site was located alongside a major urban commuter road close to Sydney's central business district and remote from the study area. The annual average daily traffic volume at this site was 64&#x02005;418 vehicles per day during 2005.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2012001201F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Study area and field sites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="BMJOPEN2012001201f02"/></fig><p>We selected six sites in a 500&#x02013;1000&#x02005;m circumference around the stack and two sites on either side of the major commuter road. The stack sites were chosen based on the feasibility of accommodating testing procedures and identification of 20&#x02005;min walking routes, which were all on quiet residential streets with low traffic volumes, and were not undulating. Participants were asked to walk at a comfortable, even pace.</p><p>For each study day, two of the six stack sites were selected and defined as &#x02018;upwind&#x02019; or &#x02018;downwind&#x02019; sites based on the wind direction recorded at 06:00 that morning.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>Prior to fieldwork we conducted spirometry, measured nitric oxide concentration in exhaled breath (eNO) and performed allergen skin prick tests (SPTs) on participants in the WIMR laboratory. Participants completed a questionnaire recording asthma diagnosis, wheeze, medication use, respiratory symptoms and odour perception,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17">15&#x02013;17</xref> as experienced in the preceding 3&#x02005;months. Participants also completed a series of 14 visual analogue scales (VAS) to rate their perception of respiratory and chest, nose, throat and eye symptoms. They rated odour perception (strength and annoyance) on a VAS if they responded affirmatively to detecting odour. Symptoms were ranked on VAS scales from &#x02018;no symptoms&#x02019; (0) to &#x02018;the worst I can imagine&#x02019; (100). These data were used to determine pre-existing disease and to characterise the study population.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Fieldwork</title><p>Participants were either transported in a mini-van or made their own way to the field site. They were asked to wear N95 mask (Alpha Protech N95 particulate face mask certified to NIOSH standards) from when they left home each morning until measurements were made, to minimise exposure on route. They were asked to withhold long-acting bronchodilators for 12&#x02005;h and short-acting bronchodilators for 6&#x02005;h before fieldwork.</p><p>Each exposure period was started at 07:00 and lasted approximately 2&#x02005;h, incorporating two 20&#x02005;min periods of walking and two rest periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001201F1">figure 1</xref>). During each exposure, subjects underwent three rounds of testing including completion of VAS forms, eNO measurement and spirometry, in that order, and at timepoints as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2012001201F1">figure 1</xref>. Participants were allocated to pairs for testing and walking, with each pairing maintained (as much as possible) throughout the 3&#x02005;years of testing.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Clinical tests</title><p>We used a hand-held spirometer (QRS Diagnostic: Z-5000-2668) linked to Office Medic software (V. 4.5i) to record forced expiratory volume in 1&#x02005;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Spirometry was performed according to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) criteria with technically unsatisfactory curves identified at the time of testing and again after fieldwork. These technically unsatisfactory curves were excluded from analysis. To improve reliability of the measures we chose the highest of two values reproducible within 150&#x02005;ml for FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC. Where not reproducible, curves were rechecked for quality and, if acceptable, the highest measures for FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC were selected.</p><p>We used an off-line technique to measure eNO, according to ATS/ERS criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> at an expiratory flow rate of 200&#x02005;ml/s.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> Exhaled breath was collected into a 3-litre chemically inert bag through a rotameter incorporating a filter and an NO scrubber on the inlet valve, to exclude the influence of ambient NO levels on personal NO concentrations. The NO concentration was measured within 24&#x02005;h of collection using a chemiluminescence analyser (ThermoEnvironmental 42&#x000b0;C).</p><p>SPTs were performed using airborne allergens for house dust mites (<italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic>, <italic>D. farinae</italic>), mould (Alternaria, Aspergillus), cat pelt, dog, cockroach, ryegrass and grass mix (Hollister-Stier).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> Wheal sizes were measured as the average of the largest diameter and its perpendicular at 15 min. Wheals larger than 3&#x02005;mm in diameter and larger than the negative control were considered positive. Subjects with any positive SPT were classified as atopic.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Air quality monitoring</title><p>Air quality monitoring took place on each field testing day at each visited site, constituting a total of 18 measurement days. We collected samples for particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1</sub>), volatile organic compounds (VOCSs), total oxides of nitrogen (NOx), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxide (NO).</p><p>We used Osiris instruments to collect PM data in 2006 and 2007 and Topas units for collection of PM data in 2008 due to the unavailability of Osiris instruments. Concentrations of PM data were recorded as 2&#x02005;min averages.</p><p>VOC samples were collected using a stainless-steel canister and inlet designed to collect an evenly spaced sample over the 2&#x02005;h of fieldwork, providing an average reading. The samples were analysed at the CSIRO Laboratory in 2006 and 2008 for 1,3-butadiene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, <italic>m</italic>-+<italic>p</italic>-xylene, <italic>o</italic>-xylene. Samples were analysed by an alternative laboratory in 2007 but the limit of detection (DL) was higher and given that many of the readings were below this DL we excluded the 2007 data.</p><p>Samples for ambient NOx/NO<sub>2</sub> were collected via grab samples every 15 min at each site using identical collection bags as those used for eNO collection. These were analysed (within 24&#x02005;h) as for eNO analysis.</p><p>We obtained continuously recorded data for 2006&#x02013;2007 for NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> from two air quality monitors sited in elevated positions near the ventilation stacks and established by the tunnel proponents for statutory purposes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Wind direction</title><p>Wind direction for each field day was determined using meteorological forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology and by releasing slightly buoyant balloons filled with a mixture of air and helium from an elevated location near the western stack.</p><p>To validate our choice of testing sites, wind speed and direction data were obtained from three air quality monitoring stations located near the western ventilation stack, including the elevated site mentioned above. The other two were ground-level stations, operated for all three study years. We constructed wind roses for the three monitoring sites using Lakes Environmental WRPlot View (V.6.5.1).</p><p>Post hoc validation of assignment of downwind and upwind study sites for each testing day was checked using wind rose data. Where the chosen locations were within &#x000b1;45&#x000b0; of the measured downwind or upwind direction, they were deemed to be accurate downwind or upwind locations, respectively. This validation was used in the sensitivity analysis. Data for the heavily trafficked site (north or south side of the road) were included in the sensitivity analysis in the same way. Data were also excluded where wind speed was &#x0003c;1&#x02005;m/s.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Health outcomes</title><p>The distributions of eNO were skewed and so these values were log-transformed. All other dependent variables were analysed without transformation.</p><p>Principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to reduce the 14 symptom scores to five factors which were found to explain 77% of the overall variance. The scree plot suggested that this was the optimum number of factors. Hence, a five-factor structure was fitted with varimax rotation using data for all 3&#x02005;years. The five-factor scores were output for each observation and these were used as continuous measures of symptom intensity. The five symptom factors were (1) itchy/dry/sore eyes and blocked nose (EYE); (2) sore/dry throat, sore chest and runny nose (THROAT); (3) chest tightness, difficulty breathing (CHEST); (4) sneezing, cough, watery eyes; (SNEEZE) and (5) dry-nose symptoms (DRY NOSE). The distributions of VAS scores for &#x02018;strong smell&#x02019; and &#x02018;annoying smell&#x02019; were highly skewed and included a large proportion of zero values, and so were treated as binary outcomes: zero (&#x02018;no&#x02019;) and greater than zero (&#x02018;yes&#x02019;).</p><p>To estimate the air pollutant means we first calculated the daily means for each pollutant, and then calculated the mean pollutant level by location and year.</p><p>We analysed the data using an &#x02018;intention to treat&#x02019; approach, based on the locations chosen for each group for each field-testing session. Data for timepoint_0 were excluded from the main analyses based on the assumption that exposure had not started when that measurement was made. We used a mixed effects linear regression model in which the fixed effects were location (upwind, downwind, control) and year (2006, 2007, 2008), and used contrast statements to test specific interactions between them. We also used contrast statements to estimate the overall difference (averaged over all years) in effect between the heavily trafficked location and the upwind and downwind locations combined. Since we expected that health outcomes would be worse at the heavily trafficked site, this served as a validation of the design. We included a random intercept term for subjects, with a variance components covariance structure, to account for repeated measures within subjects. Spirometric outcomes, eNO and the five symptom factors were separately included as outcome variables. Significance of the fixed effects was tested using F tests. Least squares means were estimated for each combination of year and location. Analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.2 PROC MIXED procedures.</p><p>The binary variables &#x02018;strong smell&#x02019; and &#x02018;annoying smell&#x02019; were treated identically except that a generalised linear mixed model was fitted with Proc GLIMMIX using the adaptive quadrature estimation method, a logistic link and a binomial error distribution in SAS V.9.2. Examination of the distribution of residuals indicated that there were no major departures from normality and transformation of the data was not required.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Air pollutant concentrations</title><p>We used a similar mixed effects linear regression model with contrast statements, to test the effects of location and year, and their interaction, on air pollutant measurements (NOx, NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>1</sub>), excluding VOCs where there were too few readings. A random intercept term for days was used to account for repeated measures. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for the air quality data by re-fitting the models using data that were validated using the wind-rose method, as described earlier.</p><p>For the elevated monitor data, we used an autoregressive error model with Yule-Walker estimates and stepwise regression to determine whether there was a difference in air quality between 2006 (pretunnel) and 2007 (post-tunnel opening), by comparing daily averages for the 2&#x02005;years. We adjusted this analysis for changes in regional air quality measured at three regulatory monitoring stations operated by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW), including as a covariate the change in average daily readings from the DECCW sites combined. We tested up to 20 lags, residuals were plotted to check for normality, and the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function were checked for autocorrelation.

This absence of any adverse health effect might be explained by the fact that we did not measure higher pollutant concentrations at the downwind stack sites after the tunnel opened. The finding of increased pollutant levels and increased symptoms and airway inflammation during periods of exposure at the heavily trafficked site supports previous evidence of the detrimental effects of short-term exposures to TRAP.</p><p>This study relied on the proposition that the downwind sites we selected were, in fact, exposed to emissions from the tunnel ventilation stack during peak traffic periods. For a downwind site to be impacted by the emission plume from the stack the plume needed to be mixed at ground level prior to reaching the site and subjected to consistent wind direction during the sampling period. We used weather balloons early on each study morning in order to select the most appropriate downwind site. Compared to the upwind locations, pollutant concentrations at the downwind locations were similar, or sometimes slightly lower. This may have reflected actual conditions in the field suggesting that there was little measurable impact of the plume on the pollutants measured. However, this finding may have also arisen due to inaccurate prediction of the ground-level location of the plume. Nevertheless, the sensitivity analysis we conducted was designed to address this potential weakness. The findings of that analysis support the original analysis.</p><p>Our finding that eNO, an indicator of airway inflammation, was increased at the heavily trafficked site is consistent with evidence of increased airway inflammation after exposure to TRAP (or diesel) in previous studies.

It is unlikely that the participants were aware of the upwind/downwind status of their location on any given day. The study was further strengthened by including the heavily trafficked sites as a positive control. The finding that pollutant levels were higher, and that subjects had greater airway inflammation, eye and chest symptom scores at this site, support the validity of the study methodology. The before/after nature of our study and repeated measures within and across years also strengthened the study design.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the differential loss from the groups over time. Common reasons for nonparticipation in follow-up years were travel overseas, residence relocation and changing work practices, all factors unrelated to the experience of study participation.</p><p>In conclusion, while we found that this ventilation stack, under current operating conditions, had little measurable short-term health impact, we did demonstrate adverse health effects attributable to short-term exposures to TRAP at heavily trafficked locations. These findings support evidence from existing studies of the adverse health effects attributable to short-term exposures to TRAP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e181" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001201.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e182" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001201.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the volunteers for their participation in this study.
