protection has never been applied to other infection control measures such as the
use of personal protective equipment, which could also act to prevent transmission
of infection. Theoretically, such interventions applied to a population could also
interrupt transmission of infection if enough people are protected above the
critical threshold for herd protection.</p><p>Personal protective equipment plays an important role in the prevention of
respiratory infections in healthcare settings, particularly during the early phase

the sick and to protect wearers from splash and spray of blood and body fluids.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0300060516665491" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, medical masks are not designed for respiratory protection and their

protective equipment, or whether the use of N95 respirators by enough HCWs can
reduce infection risk in unprotected HCWs within a closed setting such as a ward.

respiratory infections by HCWs wearing N95 respirators in hospital wards. In this
present study, there was an inverse relationship between the level of compliance
with wearing an N95 respirator and the risk of CRI; and the MCL was shown to be 50%.
A previous analysis of data from this prospective cluster randomized clinical trial
demonstrated that N95 respirators have efficacy in protecting against CRI.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0300060516665491" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, this present analysis has demonstrated that there was no significant
difference between the rates of CRI in compliant and non-compliant N95 users by
ward, with each ward being a closed environment for transmission of infection, which
suggests that a herd protection effect for the non-compliant users was conferred by
the compliant users. This present analysis also showed that non-compliant N95 users
had a significantly lower rate of infection than the control subjects who did not
use any masks (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.26; 95% CI 0.08, 0.82; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.022), again
suggesting a benefit of herd protection from the complaint users.</p><p>In contrast to non-communicable diseases, it is the unique contagious nature of
infections that results in the potential for herd protection. Transmission of
infection within a closed setting is dynamic, with chains of transmission from one
infected person to the next being established.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0300060516665491" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> As such, interruption of transmission below a critical threshold by any
means, whether it is vaccination or personal protective equipment, can reduce the
chains of transmission and result in &#x02018;herd protection&#x02019;. As shown in this present
study, even though not 100% of participants of each ward wore N95 respirators above
the MCL (50% compliance rate), the reduction of incidence of CRI still occurred in
the non-compliant users due to the intervention by N95 respirators. To date, herd
protection has been discussed only in the context of immunization programmes.
However, this present study suggests that a herd effect as a result of interventions
other than vaccinations are possible.</p><p>This study had a number of limitations. First, the data from the convenience control
arm may have been a source of bias.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0300060516665491" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The control arm was not randomized because mask use was widespread in Chinese
healthcare settings and it was unethical to ask HCWs to not wear a mask during the
influenza season. Most subjects in the control arm wore medical masks at some stage,
but not N95 respirators. Secondly, the sample size within each compliance level for
the rates of CRI and for the analyses based on variables such as sex, handwashing
and vaccinations was relatively small (mostly &#x0003c;10), which might reduce the power
of the study. Thirdly, community exposure cannot be ruled out and participants may
have contracted CRI in the community.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that herd protection from respiratory infections
was provided by N95 respirators. The benefits of respirator use within a closed
setting such as a hospital ward may extend beyond the individual who is wearing it.
Future studies on the herd effects of other interventions that interrupt
transmission of infections, and larger scale studies, are required to confirm the
herd effect and implications for hospital infection control.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Our sincere thanks go to the staff at the Beijing Centre for Disease Control,
