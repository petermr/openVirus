The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)&#x02013;B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010a">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1_lrg"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015d"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Developmental exposure to environmental factors can disrupt the immune system.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Long-term low-dose exposure to chemical mixtures is linked to imunodeficiency</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Immunodeficiency contributes to chronic diseases and the current Covid-19 pandemics.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Environmental chemicals and microorganisms share similar molecular pathomechanisms (AhR pathway).</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">Understanding the underlying pathomechanisms helps to improve public health.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Xenobiotics</kwd><kwd>Pollutants</kwd><kwd>Immune deficiency</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Chronic diseases</kwd><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Epidemic</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Human and animal health threats from coronaviruses have been present over time.

The proinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of many toxic stimuli may have limited effects on the immune system, unless exposure occurs early in life or concurrently with infections or malignant diseases. Under these circumstances, there is an increased risk of progression from exposure to infection, autoimmune diseases, or even cancer. Nevertheless, the compensatory mechanisms of the immune system limit the potential health impact at the individual level, although minor immunomodulatory effects may have an impact at the population level by contributing to increased burden of diseases (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Hartung and Corsini, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">Environmental factors are believed to contribute to the increased prevalence of allergies and autoimmune diseases, many of which are due to the activity of Th17&#x000a0;T cells. These Th17&#x000a0;T cells are a newly-identified helper T-cell subset characterized by production of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22, as observed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref rid="bib170" ref-type="bibr">Veldhoen et al., 2008</xref>) and more recently in COVID-19 patients in China. The immunologic response of barrier organs (e.g., skin, gut, lung, eyes, and oral and genital mucosal tissues) against pathogenic microbes and protein antigens, including SARS-CoV-2, is disrupted in hematopoietic stem cells, innate immune system cells, as well as in T-cell subsets and B cells.</p><p id="p0060">Chronic exposure to environmental chemicals has been shown to suppress or enhance immune responsiveness, depending on factors such as dose, timing, and route of exposure. For example, environmental immunology has led to the understanding of how xenobiotics (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) acting via immunomodulatory signaling pathways, and specifically the aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR), may adversely affect the developing immune system (which seems to be more sensitive to environmental insults than the adult immune system (<xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Kreitinger et al., 2016</xref>)). Immunotoxicology can also be beneficial in investigating whether an epidemic/pandemic, or a chronic disease, is idiopathic or a deterministic event reflecting cumulative adverse effects on the immune system. Understanding the impact of environmental toxic stimuli on the immune response ultimately contributes to improving public health.</p><p id="p0065">Many decades ago, infectious diseases were the main cause of mortality globally. With the increased influx of modern technology and its under-regulated adverse byproducts into the environment and workplace, non-communicable diseases have replaced infectious diseases as the leading cause of mortality world-wide. However, infectious diseases are still amongst the top five causes of global death (<xref rid="bib185" ref-type="bibr">Winans et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">Xenobiotics, whether natural or anthropogenic, can readily interact with the immune system, leading to a suppressed or enhanced immune responsiveness (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Fenga et al., 2017</xref>). Of increasing concern is the observed reduced immune response to viral and bacterial infection, as well as myelosuppression and thymic dysfunction. For example, coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins have been shown to mediate their effect via the AhR. Such effects include diminished humoral antibody responses, humoral immune suppression (<xref rid="bib152" ref-type="bibr">Silkworth and Antrim, 1985</xref>), severe thymic atrophy, and reduced cell-mediated immunity, to name a few.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>The AhR signaling pathway in immune system responses against xenobiotics and viruses</title><p id="p0075">The AhR is an evolutionarily ancient protein that can be activated or inhibited by various types of exogenous and endogenous ligands. While AhR canonical signaling has been identified as a primary mediator of biological responsiveness to environmental chemicals, alternative signaling events are increasingly being understood to mediate the physiological effects of AhR (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Khazaal et al., 2018</xref>). AhR is a cytosolic signal sensor and transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus upon binding to planar aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, AhR signaling is intricately involved in fine-tuning distinct immune responses, particularly at environmental interfaces where endogenous and exogenous AhR ligands accumulate (<xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">Quintana et al., 2008</xref>). For example, AhR activity has been documented to be a key determinant of T helper (Th) cell differentiation. Notably, ligands with differential AhR agonist activity may have opposing effects on Th cell differentiation, demonstrating the finely tuned regulation of this transcription factor at the ligand-binding level (<xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">Quintana et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="p0080">The AhR signaling pathway plays a key role in innate and adaptive immune responses, and controls transcription of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes like cytochrome P450 family members (e.g., CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) (<xref rid="bib155" ref-type="bibr">Stockinger et al., 2014</xref>). Exogenous AhR ligands include environmental toxic stimuli (e.g., dioxin), bacterial metabolites, or naturally occurring ligands, such as dietary ligands (e.g., flavonoids and glucosinolates), abundantly found in plants (<xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh et al., 2010</xref>). Starting from infancy, AhR levels in hepatic, lung, and thymic cytosol slowly decline with age. Thus, while innate immune cells in children have high expression of AhR, immune cells in adults have conservative to low AhR expression (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Esser and Rannug, 2015</xref>), representing a potential important highlighted finding in COVID-19 prevalence in adults.</p><p id="p0085">It is recognized that polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, and biphenyls can activate AhR given their structural resemblance to physiologic ligands. This, in turn, may increase the metabolic turnover of physiologic ligands, thus decreasing their half-life. As a result, uncontrolled or persistent activation of the AhR by exogenous small molecules or UVB radiation may alter the tightly controlled and transient AhR-regulated cell functions (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Esser and Rannug, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0090">AhR signaling is dependent of the formation of complexes with other proteins (cross-talk), such as AhR-interacting protein (AIP), estrogen receptor (ER), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), prostaglandin synthase (PGHS), retinoblastoma protein (RB), tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XME) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Beischlag et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="p0095">AhR canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways can regulate master regulatory transcriptional factors, such as the nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B promoter and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). These transcriptional factors regulate the general transcriptional machinery to induce transcriptional, post-translational and epigenetic expression of selective inflammatory genes (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt and Ghosh, 2014</xref>). Additionally, cytosolic AhR and NF-kB regulate calcium-related genes, increasing rapidly the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations that drive cardiac and skeletal muscle pathology. This sequence leads to downstream pro-inflammatory responses mediated by c-src, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and C&#x02013;C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1) (<xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">N'Diaye et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). AhR is also a key component for T cell development and activation mainly through the action of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway (<xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Xenobiotics induce regulatory T cell (iTreg) deficits, as found in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="bib186" ref-type="bibr">Wing and Sakaguchi, 2010</xref>), through their impact on AhR.</p><p id="p0100">Xenobiotics and viruses affect the immune cells (e.g. hematopoietic, myeloid, lymphoid) as well as the immune system barriers of the lung, gut, mucosal epithelia and the placenta through differential and variable AhR expression levels (<xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">Quintana and Sherr, 2013</xref>). AhR deficiency and AhR dysregulation can impair the development of the aforementioned tissue barriers as well as the function of the adaptive and innate immune systems (<xref rid="bib151" ref-type="bibr">Sherr and Monti, 2013</xref>). For example, smokers are more sensitive to viral and bacterial infection due to increased CYP1A1/CYP1B1 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression through AhR activation by PAHs present in tobacco smoke, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">Ono et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0105">The AhR molecular pathway regulates the immune response against bacterial and viral attacks. Therefore, it plays a role in the context of autoimmunity, infection, and cancer. Additionally, AhR modulates the circadian clinical manifestations of infectious diseases and opens potential opportunities for developing targeted therapeutics (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Guti&#x000e9;rrez-V&#x000e1;zquez and Quintana, 2018</xref>). Hence, the circadian rhythm (evening)- observed exacerbation of clinical symptoms in malaria, bacterial sepsis, or seriously ill COVID-19 patients can be regulated by AhR.</p><p id="p0110">AhR not only affects the immune responses to viral infection, but can also interact with viral proteins and affects viral latency.

). The human gut virome, the &#x02018;missing link&#x02019; between gut bacteria and host immunity, is a poorly understood component of the gut microbiota (<xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">Reyes et al., 2012</xref>). Diet, antibiotic use, and geographic variation can substantially affect the gut virome. Synthetic diets or diets with no vegetables and fruits have very low AhR activators, such as polyphenols and glucosinolates. These deficient diets can adversely affect the organogenesis of intestinal lymphoid follicles and innate immune cell homeostasis in the gut (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Holtz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib164" ref-type="bibr">Tsiaoussis et al., 2019</xref>).<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Xenobiotics, viruses, bacteria, obesity and aging acting through AhR.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0120">Exposure of the gut microbiota to various antibiotics has led to a substantial enrichment of the gut microbiome with phage-encoded genes that confer resistance to the administered and similarly acting antibiotics. This increased resistance, however, has created rather complicated biofilms promoting persistent infections or chronic inflammation (<xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Modi et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, microbiome is a highly dynamic ecosystem that evolves with age (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). This also reflects the profound interpersonal diversity of the gut virome (<xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Minot et al., 2013</xref>). The virus&#x02013;bacterial-host interactions in the gut play a protective role against gastrointestinal diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants (<xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Neu and Walker, 2011</xref>), ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and highlight the role of viruses in contributing to the initiation of inflammation (<xref rid="bib177" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0125">It is well established that pulmonary tissue is the most sensitive human tissue in COVID-19. Of particular interest is the fact that alveolar cells express the AhR at high levels at the basal matrix underneath the alveoli in which immune cells are found [namely mast cells, lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)] (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Frericks et al., 2007</xref>). This part of the respiratory system, however, is vulnerable to the effects of very fine particulate matter (especially matter with a diameter less than 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, which is mainly produced by diesel engines, charcoal-burning, wood-burning, and industrial exhausts). This vulnerability is because particles of this size are able to bypass the protective mechanisms of the respiratory tract and accumulate in the alveolar tissue.

All these elements play key roles in increasing inflammation and its resulting morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">Salanitro et al., 2012</xref>).

Several micronutrients and dietary components have been shown to play specific roles in the development and maintenance of an effective immune system. For example, arginine is necessary for the nitric oxide generation by macrophages, and vitamin A and zinc are known regulators of cell division. Vitamin E is both an antioxidant (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Han, 2018</xref>) and protein kinase C activity inhibitor (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Childs et al., 2019</xref>). Dietary and supplementation interventions enriching the gut microbiome, such as the use of probiotics and prebiotics (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), may be needed to help enhancing or restoring a healthy gut microbiome. In addition, diets lacking vegetables may decrease the diversity of nutrients reaching the gut microbiome. This in turn alters epithelial integrity resulting in increased permeability or &#x02018;leaky gut&#x02019;, allowing immune cells within the gut-associated lymphoid tissue to be directly exposed to intraluminal nutrients or elements of the gut microbiota. A great example of altered gut permeability induced by micronutrient status is that of vitamin D. Specifically, vitamin D-deficient diets are found to be responsible for increased epithelial permeability due to dysfunctioning tight junctions, resulting in both acute and chronic gut inflammation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Bischoff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Sassi et al., 2018</xref>).
