Most of the pneumonia patients had multiple ground-glass opacity in the chest CT scan, there were no differences in opacity among the four groups (P &#x0003e; 0.05).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0010"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The laboratory findings and imaging features of respiratory virus-infected patients.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0015">Table 2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Flu A virus (n = 72)</th><th align="left">Flu B virus (n = 32)</th><th align="left">COVID-19 (n = 18)</th><th align="left">RSV<break/>(n = 14)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">White blood cell count, &#x000d7;10&#x02079;/L</td><td align="left">6.44 &#x000b1; 2.23</td><td align="left">5.44 &#x000b1; 2.36</td><td align="left">5.02 &#x000b1; 1.62</td><td align="left">11.49 &#x000b1; 5.93</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Neutrophil count, &#x000d7;10&#x02079;/L</td><td align="left">4.91 &#x000b1; 2.25</td><td align="left">3.87 &#x000b1; 2.19</td><td align="left">2.70(1.95-3.25)</td><td align="left">8.03(4.33-11.73)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lymphocyte count, &#x000d7;10&#x02079;/L</td><td align="left">0.81(0.50-1.41)</td><td align="left">1.01 &#x000b1; 0.44</td><td align="left">1.61 &#x000b1; 0.65</td><td align="left">1.80 &#x000b1; 1.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hemoglobin, g/L</td><td align="left">136.59 &#x000b1; 21.04</td><td align="left">145.20 &#x000b1; 24.19</td><td align="left">143.56 &#x000b1; 21.69</td><td align="left">117.00 &#x000b1; 31.54</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Platelet count, &#x000d7;10&#x02079;/L</td><td align="left">196.00 &#x000b1; 57.59</td><td align="left">193.00 &#x000b1; 49.29</td><td align="left">214.67 &#x000b1; 60.40</td><td align="left">222.64 &#x000b1; 122.11</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C-reactive protein, mg/L</td><td align="left">15.50(3.57-58.21)</td><td align="left">6.02(2.58-20.75)</td><td align="left">10.30(0.92-21.52)</td><td align="left">36.73(11.61-99.55)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Pneumonia in chest CT</td><td align="left">15/31 (48.39%)</td><td align="left">2/14 (14.29%)</td><td align="left">15/18 (83.33%)</td><td align="left">9/14 (64.29%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Solitary lesion</td><td align="left">2 (13.33%)</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">4 (26.67%)</td><td align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Multiple lesion</td><td align="left">13 (86.67%)</td><td align="left">2 (100%)</td><td align="left">11 (73.33%)</td><td align="left">9 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Consolidation</td><td align="left">1 (6.67%)</td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">1 (6.67%)</td><td align="left">1 (11.11%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ground-glass opacity</td><td align="left">14 (93.33%)</td><td align="left">2 (100%)</td><td align="left">14 (93.33%)</td><td align="left">8 (88.89%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Notes: Flu A: influenza A; Flu B: influenza B; COVID-19: coronavirus disease, 2019; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0040"><title>Discussion</title><p id="par0080">In this study, even though conducted during the spreading of 2019-nCoV, more than half of the patients with positive etiology had the Flu A virus infection in Beijing. Less common was the Flu B virus infection. This is similar to that previously reported (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Al-Baadani et al., 2019</xref>). Only 11.94% and 10.45% of the patients had COVID-19 and RSV infections, respectively. Although COVID-19 should be taken seriously, other respiratory viral infections, especially influenza, should not be ignored. To distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory virus infections, the epidemic history was an essential criterion because, compared to the other three groups, the COVID-19 group had a higher clustering onset, and a higher rate of contact with an epidemic area within 14 days.</p><p id="par0085">Similar to what has been reported for COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), fever was the most common symptom in respiratory virus infection patients. In this study, the ratio of fever to the highest temperature was higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. Given the absence of fever and low-grade fever in COVID-19 patients and its high risk (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>), it was practical to ask fever-free patients with respiratory symptoms to screen as previously recommended (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Even though the rate of pharyngalgia, headache, myalgia, and fatigue were relatively higher in influenza infection groups, it could not be said that the presence of these symptoms was meaningful for excluding COVID-19 because they were not specific symptoms in different respiratory virus infection. In fact, no specific symptoms were helpful in distinguishing COVID-19 from other respiratory virus infections (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0090">As previously reported, COVID-19 patients had low or normal WBC and neutrophil count (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). And in this study, it was found that COVID-19 patients even had lower WBC counts and neutrophil counts than Flu A virus and RSV infection groups. Although it was reported that COVID-19 patients had low lymphocyte counts (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>), this study found that the lymphocyte count was higher in COVID-19 than in Flu A and B virus infection patients. These results showed that low WBC, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were suggestive of viral infection, but could not distinguish different between the respiratory-virus groups. Also, even though the CRP level was higher in the RSV infection group than in COVID-19 and Flu B infection groups, it was not statistically different in Flu A infection, Flu B infection, and COVID-19 groups. Lower WBC and lymphocyte levels and higher CRP levels might be more valuable in monitoring disease severity rather than in screening for COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). The value of CBC parameters and CRP deserve more study in respiratory viral infections.</p><p id="par0095">The percentage of pneumonia in the Chest CT scan was higher in the COVID-19 group than in Flu A and B virus infection group. This finding was similar to other studies that showed COVID-19 patients were likely to have pneumonia (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). And the possibility of COVID-19 should be considered if pneumonia was found in a chest CT scan during the spreading of 2019-nCoV, as was recommended in a screening procedure in a fever clinic (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="par0100">There are some limitations to this study. First, only one center was enrolled in the study. It might not be that representative of the whole city of Beijing. Second, most patients, especially the COVID-19 patients, were mild cases on the first visit. They were not representative of respiratory viral infections of varying severity. Third, no follow-up data were available in this study, therefore it was impossible to analyze the whole clinical course of different virus infections.</p></sec><sec id="sec0045"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="par0105">Influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of cases respiratory virus infection, even during the epidemic of 2019-nCoV, in Beijing. No single symptom nor laboratory finding was indicative of a specific respiratory virus; however, the epidemic history was valuable for screening out COVID-19 patients. A combination of epidemic history, symptoms, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, and finally, a pathogenic examination was essential for an accurate diagnosis of respiratory virus infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec0050"><title>Funding</title><p id="par0110">This study was funded by the <funding-source id="gs0005">Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences&#x02019; Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences</funding-source> (2020-I2M-CoV19-002).</p></sec><sec id="sec0055"><title>Declarations of interest</title><p id="par0115">None.</p></sec><sec id="sec0060"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="par0120">The work was approved by the institutional review board committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec0065"><title>Authors&#x02019; contribution</title><p id="par0125">Huadong Zhu, Jihai Liu, Yan Li, Jiangshan Wang, Xuezhong Yu, Jun Xu and Yi Li designed the study.
