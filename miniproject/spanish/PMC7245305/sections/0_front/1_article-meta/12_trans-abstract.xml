 <p>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which affects the entire population in general, poses a special risk for patients with chronic kidney disease because of their immunosuppression status, advanced age and the coexistence of significant comorbidity.</p>
 <p>Renal patients undergoing hemodialysis run the risk not only of suffering but also of transmitting and spreading COVID-19 due to multiple factors, both procedural and logistical, associated with the process. These include the long duration of the technique, collective transfer to and from the centres, and the waiting time before performing the technique, aspects that make strict isolation difficult and therefore increase not only the risk of contagion between patients but also between specialist health professionals, which makes it more difficult to replace professionals.</p>
 <p>Prevention, protection, detection, isolation and distribution measures are essential in the management of the epidemic and must be taken from the initial stage. For this to be possible, it is necessary to draw up protocols to guide the actions of both the patient and the professionals in the different stages of chronic renal disease.</p>
