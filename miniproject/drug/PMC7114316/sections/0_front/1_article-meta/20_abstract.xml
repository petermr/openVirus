 <p>The computational search of chemical libraries has been used as a powerful tool for the rapid discovery of candidate compounds. To find small molecules with anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) properties, we utilized a virtual screening technique to identify the active site on the viral protease for the binding of the available natural compounds. The protease 3CL (3CL
  <sup>pro</sup>) plays an important role in the replication cycle of FIPV and other viruses within the family 
  <italic>Coronaviridae.</italic> The 15 best-ranked candidate consensus compounds, based on three docking tools, were evaluated for further assays. The protease inhibitor assay on recombinant FIPV 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> was performed to screen the inhibitory effect of the candidate compounds with IC
  <sub>50</sub> ranging from 6.36 ± 2.15 to 78.40 ± 2.60 μM. As determined by the cell-based assay, the compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 showed better EC
  <sub>50</sub> values than the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir, under all the test conditions including pre-viral entry, post-viral entry, and prophylactic activity. The NSC87511 particularly yielded the best selective index (&gt;4; range of SI = 13.80–22.90). These results indicated that the natural small-molecular compounds specifically targeted the 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> of FIPV and inhibited its replication. Structural modification of these compounds may generate a higher anti-viral potency for the further development of a novel therapy against FIP.
