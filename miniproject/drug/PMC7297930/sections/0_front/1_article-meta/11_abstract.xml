 <p id="Par1">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 significantly affects multiple systems including the cardiovascular system. Most importantly, in addition to the direct injury from the virus per se, the subsequent cytokine storm, an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds, causes devastating damage. To date, emerging anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments are warranted to control epidemics. Several candidate drugs have been screened and are currently under investigation. These primarily include antiviral regimens and immunomodulatory regimens. However, beyond the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, these drugs may also have risks to the cardiovascular system, especially altering cardiac conduction. Herein, we review the cardiovascular risks of potential anti-COVID-19 drugs.</p>
