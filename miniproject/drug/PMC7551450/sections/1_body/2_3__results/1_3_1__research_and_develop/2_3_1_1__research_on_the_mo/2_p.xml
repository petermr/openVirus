<p>Firstly, research related to the mechanisms of infection, the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and the identification of a virus–host interaction mechanism (Sub-Cluster 1-1) in general consisted of 81 projects worth 186,810,747 USD. The University of Maryland in the US recently completed a project called “Host, pathogen, and the microbiome: determinants of infectious disease outcomes” and spent 19.6 million USD between 2014 and 2019. The University of Pittsburgh and the University of Iowa have participated in projects entitled “Targeting host responses to prevent virus induced ARDS in the nonhuman primate model” and “Role of eicosanoids in pathogenic human CoV infections”, respectively. Meanwhile, Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam of the EU and Yamaguchi University of Japan conducted a project entitled “European management platform for emerging and reemerging infectious disease entities” with expenditures of 18.6 million USD between 2009 and 2014, and “Elucidation of the mutation mechanism and virulence acquisition machine of coronavirus” with a cost of 514,800 USD between 2015 and 2018, respectively (see
