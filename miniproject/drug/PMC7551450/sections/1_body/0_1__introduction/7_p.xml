<p>Due to the magnitude of the public funds invested in infectious disease-related research [
 <xref rid="B14-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the Korean government has to evaluate their investment strategy about which research fields must be invested in and in which research fields is needed collaboration with international partners to reach important research goals [
 <xref rid="B13-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To date, few studies have provided a comprehensive analysis of infectious disease R&amp;D from a public funding perspective [

 <xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study to satisfy both prerequisites for understanding what coronavirus disease-related research and development has been conducted from both the world’s and South Korea’s perspectives. Therefore, this study aims to provide useful information about the coronavirus disease-related scientific research trends of leading nations and Korea during the 2012–2018 time period and then analyze this research to plan further scientific research. Many studies have indicated that the US, EU, and Japan have critical roles in the scientific and technological advancements in infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="B20-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In particular, as the four leading national scientific funding organizations or programs related to the health domain in the world, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the US; the framework programs for research and innovation (i.e., Horizon 2020) funded by the EU; and the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) program of the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of the Japanese government are significant [

Therefore, the data from government-funded projects were gathered from searchable, open, project-based information databases such as STAR METRICS, CORDIS (Community Research &amp; Development Information Service, Brussels, Belgium), and KAKEN (Database of Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Shizuoka, Japan), respectively, that are available for individual or multiple institutions in those places. Besides, the official centralized national R&amp;D database called the National Science &amp; Technology Information Service (NTIS)—which has gathered, managed, and provided all Korean government-funded research information since 2004 (

This paper aims to apply machine learning methodologies and network analysis to understand how the US, EU, and Japan have invested their funding to determine what coronavirus disease-related research fields already exist and match those to the Korean projects with designated research fields stemming from leading nations’ data analysis. Our research addresses the following questions:
