At the center of the WHO, its networks of researchers and other experts have coordinated global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modeling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and on researching other ways to identify and manage the disease and limit its onward transmission [

In order to contribute to the treatment and prevention of the virus with the collaborative efforts of countries around the world, much research will continue to be conducted in the fields of pathogen monitoring, source identification, primary etiology, clinical treatments, vaccine development, viral replication, pathogenesis, antiviral drugs, and others [

The US CDC, as well as other national governmental bodies, has the explicit goal of preventing sustained outbreaks like COVID-19 within their borders but also makes significant contributions to ongoing publicly shared research in disease transmission, diagnostics, vaccine development, and therapeutics, as well as offering guidelines to front-line clinicians and coordinating with both the WHO and local health departments [
