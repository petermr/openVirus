<p>This study aimed to elucidate the trends of coronavirus-related R&amp;D—because COVID-19 has been globally endangering human health and well-being since December 2019 and, at the moment, the spread of COVID-19 has barely been controlled in Korea—thereby deriving directions for government-driven R&amp;D to prepare for the post-corona pandemic era. Three coronavirus-related R&amp;D areas were clustered through co-occurrence matrix analysis, and then, on the subjects of two of them, five sub-clusters were additionally extrapolated based on experts’ reviews. According to the results, the US, the EU, and Japan have invested in coronavirus-related research areas through 160 projects worth 1,099,242,389 USD, nine projects worth 44,637,157 USD, and 46 projects worth 6,183,689 USD, respectively. Meanwhile, Korea has funded 170 projects worth about 81,559,215 USD. Due to the centralized database of Korea, its coronavirus-related R&amp;D activities may be overestimated. Despite this limitation, we found that developed nations focused their propensity on investing in entire research areas. On the other hand, due to the outbreak of MERS-CoV in 2015, Korea is likely to continue pursuing technological commercialization to strengthen its bio-industry competitiveness in some specific areas rather than basic research areas from a short-and medium-term viewpoint.</p>
