<p>The LNS routinely holds surveillance records of all samples received from 2000 to 2016 for national and international reporting. We performed descriptive analyses on the data available to detect spatial and temporal patterns of the cases reported by LNS across the study period. Information regarding location of the cases and the health centres was available for 2016, and this information was used to compare the origin of the cases versus the health centre visited to determine patterns of displacement to receive health services.</p>
