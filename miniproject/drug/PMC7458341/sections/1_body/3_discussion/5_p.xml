<p>A large proportion of the samples tested here were dengue-negative, which was notably high in 2015 and 2016, coinciding with the large chikungunya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and zika [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] epidemics in the country. These diseases have a similar, unspecific clinical presentation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other common causes of fever compatible with dengue in the Latin American region include leptospirosis, typhoid fever, influenza, Rickettsiosis and less common arboviruses such as Oropouche and Mayaro [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which are likely to be investigated as potential dengue cases in surveillance laboratories. Testing samples using syndromic panels that include a wider range of pathogens is currently too costly and labour intensive for routine implementation. However, co-infections and parallel epidemics are well documented. For example, dengue and chikungunya co-circulated in Guatemala, with a report indicating that both viruses were present in 32% of samples in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, testing samples with more comprehensive diagnostic panels could generate broader information on the co-circulation of pathogens and lead to improved multi-disease surveillance. The development of multiplex diagnostics such as the CDC Trioplex [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has simplified testing algorithms and improved detection of acute co-infections. However, serological tests still struggle to differentiate between DENV and Zika virus infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which may have inflated the number of probable dengue cases in our analysis.
