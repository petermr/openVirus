<p>Globally, DENV1 has been the most common serotype detected since 2010, particularly in Africa, Europe and the Western Pacific region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, DENV2 is the most commonly identified serotype in the Americas, and these two serotypes combined account for most cases in Guatemala. The infrequent detection of DENV4 is also mirrored from other settings, with monotypic DENV4 being responsible for only four percent of outbreaks globally between 2010 and 2016 [
