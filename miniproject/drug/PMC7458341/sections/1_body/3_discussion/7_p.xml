<p>The surveillance of dengue in Guatemala, and other countries in Latin America, would benefit from studies to optimise thresholds of excess reporting, which could trigger outbreak responses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and the initiation of active surveillance. Data from Australia, one of the few high income countries with dengue transmission which utilises active surveillance, has shown that rapid notification and case finding enables the minimisation of transmission by triggering public health responses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, active surveillance systems are expensive and implementation would require a robust cost-benefit analysis [
