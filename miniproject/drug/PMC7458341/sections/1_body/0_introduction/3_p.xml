<p>The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (DENV 1 to 4) share 65–70% of their genomic sequence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and overlap spatially and temporally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], with changing yearly patterns and fluctuating levels of serotype-specific immunity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Infection with one serotype provides serotype-specific immunity without significant cross protection for other serotypes and a follow-on infection with a different DENV serotype carries an increased risk of disease severity through antibody mediated enhancement [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008535.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
