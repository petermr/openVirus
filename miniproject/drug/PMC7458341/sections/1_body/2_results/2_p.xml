<p>Serotyping by culture or RT-qPCR was available for 5619 (70.2%) of 7097 confirmed cases. DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4 were detected in 2218 (39.5%), 2580 (45.9%), 591 (10.5%) and 230 (4.1%) cases, respectively. DENV1 and DENV2 had the highest frequencies, often over consecutive years (Figs

Peaks of DENV2 were observed in 2002 (262 cases) and 2003, followed by low numbers between 2006 and 2008 and a resurgence in 2009, when it caused the largest outbreak of the study period (1080 cases). DENV2 was often replaced by DENV1, most notably after the 2003 and 2010 epidemics. DENV1 predominated between 2004 and 2008, with peaks in 2005 and 2011–2015, causing 103 cases in 2011, 392 in 2012 and 542 in 2013 (
