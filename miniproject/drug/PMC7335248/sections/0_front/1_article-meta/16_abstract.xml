 <p>Viruses continue to be a major threat to human health. In the last century, pandemics occurred and resulted in significant mortality and morbidity. Natural products have been largely screened as source of inspiration for new antiviral agents. Within the huge class of plant secondary metabolites, resveratrol-derived stilbenoids present a wide structural diversity and mediate a great number of biological responses relevant for human health. However, whilst the antiviral activity of resveratrol has been extensively studied, little is known about the efficacy of its monomeric and oligomeric derivatives. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the achievements in this field, with particular emphasis on the source, chemical structures and the mechanism of action of resveratrol-derived stilbenoids against the most challenging viruses. The collected results highlight the therapeutic versatility of stilbene-containing compounds and provide a prospective insight into their potential development as antiviral agents.</p>
