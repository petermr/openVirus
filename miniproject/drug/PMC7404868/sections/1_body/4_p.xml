<p>With a surge of new viral infectious diseases appearing recently we could ask the following questions: why do these new viral infectious diseases emerge at this particular time? Why do they manifest themselves in particular geographical areas? What are the factors that lead to the emergence of these new viral infectious diseases in the first place? How can we predict future new viruses? In order to attempt to answer these questions, we will need to engage in the exchange of information across diverse disciplines and embark on projects that involve inter‐disciplinary cooperation.</p>
