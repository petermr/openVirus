<p>Our previous studies have pointed out that sunspot extremes or +/‐1 year is an important risk factor for the occurrence of new viral infectious diseases.

 </xref> Sunspot numbers are related to solar activity. During solar maximum the sun produces high‐energy and low‐energy solar particles by a process of mass ejections from the sun's surface and solar flares. When the sun is least active, the solar magnetic field gets weaker and there will be more galactic cosmic rays entering the earth. We discussed in an earlier paper that the present time 2019–2020 is characterized by very low sunspot numbers and we are in a solar minimum that is the lowest in over 100 years. Ionizing radiation (cosmic rays) which peak at this time can cause virus mutation as well as genetic recombination, particularly if viruses are included in a biosphere extending even beyond the tropopause. In order to verify the correctness of this theory we issued an early warning in a letter to

 </xref> Here we explicitly reminded the world that new infective viruses are likely to emerge in the ensuing months from mutations and/or ingress and that public health authorities must be vigilant and take necessary action. The emergence of the COVID‐19 outbreak uncannily confirms the accuracy of our early warning and highlights the urgency of taking appropriate precautions for future safety without further prevarication.
