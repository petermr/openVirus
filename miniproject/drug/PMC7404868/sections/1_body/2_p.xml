<p>There are a wide range of uncertain factors in the emergence and spread of new infectious diseases that needs to be explored. Within the current framework of medical knowledge most researchers think it impossible to predict when and where the next pandemic will occur. If one attempts to make any such prediction one needs to comprehensively detect countless potential pathogens in every possible location including the high atmosphere; but this method requires an extent of manpower and material resources that is not realistic at the present time. The most important prerequisite to early warning is to fully identify and explore those factors that are worth monitoring, and discover methods to detect an incipient epidemic in a local area before it begins to take on disastrous epidemic or pandemic proportions.</p>
