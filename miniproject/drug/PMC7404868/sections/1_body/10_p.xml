<p>As the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich once said, what a nation needs is for people to look up at the stars rather than down on the ground, and in this way a nation can have hope. Medical science should perhaps seek the cause of new viral infectious diseases by looking up at the stars. The famous Chinese book called “The Golden Mean” says: “Preparedness ensures success, and unpreparedness spells failure.” In our view “preparedness” at the present time involves setting up means to detect influences from outside the Earth, including conditions of space weather, cosmic ray flux, and arrival of novel cosmic strains of bacteria and viruses in the atmosphere. Following the discoveries of novel bacteria in the stratosphere at heights of 42km
