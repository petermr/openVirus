<p>We conclude by reiterating that a continual monitoring of the stratosphere for its bacterial and viral content as well as 
 <italic>in situ</italic> gene sequencing which is well within our biotech and space capabilities should be carried out as a priority and without further delay. In the event of a new virus or a mutated or recombined virus being detected at, say, an altitude of say 40 km, the settling time to ground level to reach the human population could be many months. This would be enough time for mitigation strategies to be put in place. As Arthur C. Clarke once said the dinosaurs became extinct because they did not have space‐guard programme. Let us hope that we humans in 2020 could be wiser.
