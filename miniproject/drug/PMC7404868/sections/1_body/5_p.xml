<p>It is becoming amply clear that we cannot solve the most fundamental questions relating to the origin of new viral infectious diseases within the comfort zone of Earth‐bound medical science alone.

It is only with such an initiative that we can come anywhere near the prevention and control of infectious diseases in the long term.</p>
