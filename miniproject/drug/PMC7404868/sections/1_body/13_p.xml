<p>Finally we propose the following framework as a strategy for the future amelioration of pandemic‐caused disasters (Figure 
 <xref rid="mco220-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>): 
 <list list-type="order" id="mco220-list-0001">
  <list-item>
   <p>Establishing a cosmic ray monitoring stations including in the troposphere, as high priority.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Concurrently setting up virus monitoring stations, with in situ Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) equipment, in high altitude locations, preferably including one sited above the atmospheric boundary layer.  Balloon borne samplers should also be considered, as well virus (PCR) samplers installed on the exterior of a space station.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>In the event of potentially harmful variants of a virus or a new virus being identified by PCR analysis, ground strategies are triggered into action.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Ground strategies must include checking resources for monitoring spread of the virus in the human population, providing hospital services (including intensive care if relevant) and in a longer term manufacturing appropriate vaccines, strengthening early symptom surveillance to identify abnormal cases.</p>
