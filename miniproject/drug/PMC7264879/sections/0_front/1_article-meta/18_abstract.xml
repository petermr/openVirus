 <title>Summary</title>
 <p>What was initially a lung infection epidemic in the metropolitan area of Wuhan followed by a now contained extension to mainland China has now spread to all continents as a major pandemic with current hotspots in Europe and the USA. This minireview is an update of an earlier report on this novel coronavirus infection (Brüssow, 2020, 
  <italic>Microb Biotech</italic> 13, 607). I am now summarizing the research literature published between end of February to mid‐April 2020.
