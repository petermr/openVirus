<p id="Par11">The H1N1 subtype influenza A virus causing the 1918 pandemic outbreak caused the seasonal epidemics until 1957 when a new influenza A virus of the H2N2 subtype emerged [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This was referred to as the “Asian” influenza virus, causing the second pandemic after the Spanish flue as stated above [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The H2N2 kept continuing the dissemination of the seasonal influenza from 1957 to 1967; and in 1968 the third pandemic appeared with the new H3N2 subtype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The H2N2 subtype, causing the pandemic in 1957, indeed continued to disseminate in humans till 1968 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The antigenic diversity of human H2N2 viruses isolated between the intermittent 12 years (from 1957 to 1968) has been well characterized; and two amino acid substitutions, T128D and N139K, located in the head domain of the H2 hemagglutinin (HA) molecule, have been shown to be the functional determinants of the antigenic change during the evolution of H2N2 subtype [
