<p id="Par7">Some of the viral factors including haemagglutinin (HA) and the polymerase gene segments are stringently known to trigger the abnormal increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, for example: Interleukin (IL)-2, 5, 6 and 8, the interferon (IFN)-inducible protein (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP1α), MIP1β and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), etc. in course of the viral pathogenesis during a pandemic outbreak [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells among the young population was another prime factor for the viral pathogenecity [

However, pointing out the virally infected persons as well applying the proper anti-viral therapy is always essential to limit the dreadful propagation of the disease. During the years 1918–1920, there were no certain drugs that could be effectively implanted for the elimination of virus. On the contrary, in the current days, several anti-viral drugs like the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are employed prophylactically in the outbreak situations [
