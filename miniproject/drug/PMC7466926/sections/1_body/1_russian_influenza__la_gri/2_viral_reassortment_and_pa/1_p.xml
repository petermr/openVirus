<p id="Par5">Interestingly, it has been recently inferred that the causative virus of the Russian influenza could be of the H3Nx subtype which circulated up to the 1918 influenza pandemic outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The logic behind such inference is that the causative virus of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic remained undefined in an aspect that whether the virus originated from the multiple reassortment events or not [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The reassortment event could be held between the avian-, swine- and human influenza viruses, or it could be introduced by a direct zoonotic transmission by the vectors stated above [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As a known information, it’s clear that the influenza pandemics occurs when the hemagglutinin (HA, or H) with or without neuraminidase (NA, or N) subtypes of influenza viruses infect humans (with little or no immunity) with the subsequent follow up of person to person transmission. So far 18 HA subtypes (H1 to H18) and 11 NA subtypes (N1 to N11) have been recognized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Besides the reassortment events as stated above, another interpretation on the viral pathogenecity underlies the point mutations within the set of genes encoding the corresponding amino acids required for antigenic expressions. Eventually such mutations augment the enhanced rate of replacement of NA and HA (possibly by the positive selection pressure) which are already known as the antigenic cluster of the viral subtype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such an event leads to parallel replacement of the antigens or even may drive the current antigens back to their ancestral forms which go a long way to impart the viral adaptation and survival within the host inactivating the protective immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A simple illustration of the viral reassortment between the influenza viruses is shown in Fig.
