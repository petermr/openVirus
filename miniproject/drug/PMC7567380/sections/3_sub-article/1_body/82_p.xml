<p>Line 193-195: “The impact on HIV incidence rate in Southern states diminished after adjustment for viral suppression and demographic characteristics to being 36% lower compared with the Northeastern states.” This statement is slightly confusing, the impact of what? Suggest changing to something such as “After adjustment for viral suppression and demographic characteristics, HIV incidence rate was 36% lower in Southern states compared to northeastern states” or “The relative difference in HIV incidence in Southern states compared to Northeasterns states diminished after.”</p>
