<p>My overarching concern is that the authors have not accounted for undiagnosed HIV in their analysis. The authors state that viral suppression measures come from data reported to CDC from jurisdictions with complete reporting of HIV viral load tests, so the viral suppression parameter reflects the proportion of *diagnosed* individuals who are virally suppressed. However, the more proximal variable related to HIV incidence would be state-level viraemia, i.e. the proportion of the *entire population* which have detectable HIV. Therefore, large difference in rates of undiagnosed HIV across states / over time may bias results. Are there any estimates of HIV prevalence / rate of undiagnosed HIV in each state which could be used in conjunction with viral suppression rates among those diagnosed to estimate community-level viremia? If this is not possible this should be discussed in the limitations, or the authors should elaborate on the rationale for using viral suppression among those diagnosed as the driver of HIV incidence.</p>
