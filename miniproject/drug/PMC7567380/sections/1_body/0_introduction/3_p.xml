<p>Similar associations between reduced viral load and reduced HIV incidence were observed in British Columbia, Canada, and in the context of a community trial in India. In British Columbia, a population-level longitudinal analysis of province-wide registries showed a 1% decline in HIV incidence for every 1% increase in viral suppression [

The authors concluded that ART expansion between 1996 and 2012 was associated with “a sustained and profound population-level decrease in morbidity, mortality and HIV transmission.” In India, a cluster-randomized trial was conducted among more than 26,000 injection drug users and men who have sex with men (MSM) from 22 communities. These researchers concluded that to reduce HIV incidence by 1%, the viremia in the population would have to be reduced by 4.3% and ART use by PWH would have to increase by 19.5% [
