<p>Means and standard deviations were used to summarize percent viral suppression and state level demographic variables by year. Quartiles for estimated HIV incidence rate and percent viral suppression were calculated across the entire time frame, and used to evaluate changes in these measures over time. Estimated annual percent changes (EAPC) in HIV incidence with corresponding fitted yearly rates were determined using Poisson regression models that included a fixed effect for year for each jurisdiction and for all 30 jurisdictions combined. Fitted yearly incidence rates were also determined by region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). Unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios associated with differences in percent viral suppression and demographic characteristics were calculated using multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression models that included a fixed effect for year, and a random intercept to account for within-state correlations. Percent viral suppression and state level demographics were treated as continuous covariates and adjusted models included 2010 estimated HIV incidence rate as a covariate. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 and R version 3.5.0.</p>
