<p>Relative standard errors (RSEs) were previously calculated for estimates of HIV incidence per state. Estimates with an RSE &gt; 50% are considered statistically unreliable and ordinarily not published, and were not included in this analysis. To understand the potential impact of this source of missing data, a sensitivity analysis was done by including these suppressed incidence estimates in the final statistical model to evaluate the change in fitted incidence rates.</p>
