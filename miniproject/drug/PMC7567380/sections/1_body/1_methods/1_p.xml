<p>The National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) serves as the source for both HIV diagnosis and viral suppression data. CDC estimates and publishes HIV incidence using the reported diagnosis data following the methodology of Song et al. using a CD4 depletion model to estimate time between infection and diagnosis [

 <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The estimation method also makes use of first reported CD4 cell count after HIV diagnosis, assuming that persons are ART naïve at the time. Reporting of first CD4 test result after diagnosis is a required element in NHSS and significant progress has been made in reporting of all levels and percentages of CD4 test results [
 <xref rid="pone.0240727.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For this analysis, we used CDC’s published HIV incidence estimates among persons 13 years or older (adults and adolescents) for the years 2010 through 2015 [
