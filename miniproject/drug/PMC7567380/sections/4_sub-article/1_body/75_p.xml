<p>AUTHORS: It is beyond the scope of this paper to elaborate the methods of previously published models which our team did not design. While two citations reference the methods, we agree with Reviewer 2 that there is some ambiguity as to the source of the HIV incidence data by state. We have added a reference and modified the Methods section to read as follows: “The National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) serves as the source for both HIV diagnosis and viral suppression data. CDC estimates and publishes HIV incidence using the reported diagnosis data following the methodology of Song et al. using a CD4 depletion model to estimate time between infection and diagnosis. The estimation method also makes use of first reported CD4 cell count after HIV diagnosis, assuming that persons were ART naïve at the time. Reporting of first CD4 test result after diagnosis is a required element in NHSS and significant progress has been made in reporting of all levels and percentages of CD4 test results. For this analysis, we used CDC’s published HIV incidence estimates among persons 13 years or older (adults and adolescents) during 2010 through 2015.” </p>
