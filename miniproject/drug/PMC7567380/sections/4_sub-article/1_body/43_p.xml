<p>This paper describes the association between state-level viral suppression among HIV-diagnosed individuals and the fittest HIV incidence rate in the following year across the United States. The authors conclude that increased viral suppression is associated with a modest decrease in HIV incidence in the following year, and report declining trends in HIV incidence across most US states during the study period. This paper describes important population-level evidence to support U=U and Treatment as Prevention, and would be of interest to PLOS-ONE readership. The statistical analysis is sound and appropriate, however there are some major limitations in using viral suppression estimates among HIV-diagnosed individuals as a proxy of community-level viraemia, which should be further discussed.</p>
