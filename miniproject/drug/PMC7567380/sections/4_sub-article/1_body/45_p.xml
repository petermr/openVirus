<p>AUTHORS: The proportion of PWH virally suppressed for each state was calculated using all persons living with HIV (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) as the denominator, so undiagnosed HIV is accounted for in the calculation of this variable. Our methodology and source data are now more explicitly described in the revised manuscript. </p>
