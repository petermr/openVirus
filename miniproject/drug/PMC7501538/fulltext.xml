Participants randomly assigned within 1 triplet block all belonged to the same ART clinic.

Participants were followed up for 12 months. Any ART client who accessed care in the study clinics during the recruitment period was approached for participation (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200622-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Once saturation was reached (ie, the study team did not identify any new potential participants for at least 1 week), we moved to recruitment in the next clinic, using a random ordering of clinics. HIV clinicians introduced the study to patients and referred them to study staff if interested, at which time eligibility was assessed and written informed consent was obtained. Viral load was not assessed prior to enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="H2-6-ZOI200622"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Participants in all 3 groups received a standard Ministry of Health recommendation from their HIV clinician to decrease alcohol use and a referral to harm reduction services and to treatment of hepatitis B and C viruses, sexually transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis. The processes for selecting and culturally adapting the 2 interventions are described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> We conducted training and provided supervision through weekly meetings using a completion checklist and the Yale Adherence and Competence Scale (YACS; range 1-7, with 7 indicating excellent fidelity)<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> to ensure sessions were standardized across our team of paraprofessional counselors who delivered the interventions. A team of 2 counselors, 1 woman and 1 man, was assigned to the combined intervention group, and a different counseling team, 1 woman and 1 man, was assigned to the brief intervention group.</p><p>Because the concept of alcohol reduction is novel in this setting, we selected a combined intervention approach that includes cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200622r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The brief intervention has similar components as the combined intervention but is briefer.</p><p>The combined group included 6 individual face-to-face sessions delivered 1 week apart and 3 optional group sessions delivered concurrently. The first session used motivational enhancement therapy, adopting a guiding but nonjudgmental style to enhance motivation. Subsequent sessions used cognitive behavioral therapy, building skills to effectively refuse alcohol, to manage cravings and high-risk situations for alcohol use, and to develop self-efficacy. Sessions also provided information on the harmful effects of drinking on HIV and overall health. Group sessions reinforced skills learned in the individual sessions and provided a forum to discuss experiences (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI200622-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Participants in the brief intervention group participated in 2 individual face-to-face sessions and 2 individual booster telephone sessions.

Behavioral measures, including ART adherence, were based on self-report. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire&#x02013;9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#x02013;7 scores, respectively, and alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse was defined using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview version 5.0.0. After the questionnaires were completed, interviewers administered the timeline follow-back interview.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Participants provided blood samples at every visit except screening for the following tests: CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count, HIV viral load (HIV-1 RNA test, COBAS AmpliPrep and COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, Roche Molecular Systems), and hepatitis B surface antigen rapid test (Alere Determine hepatitis B surface antigen reagent). Dried blood spots were collected and shipped to US Drug Testing Laboratories for phosphatidylethanol testing to detect any alcohol use during the 3 weeks before the study visit. Phosphatidylethanol is a direct metabolite of alcohol consumption that serves as a biomarker for alcohol consumption during the preceding 3 weeks.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Phosphatidylethanol levels of less than 10 ng/mL have demonstrated a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88.5% with an area under the curve operating characteristic curve of 0.92 for detection of any recent drinking (past 21 days).<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="H2-8-ZOI200622"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end points were the effect of each intervention, compared with the standard of care, on self-reported percentage of days abstinent from alcohol measured by the timeline follow-back interview and viral suppression at 12 months after enrollment.

For each outcome, we evaluated the extent to which the mean values differed across groups after baseline by intention-to-treat. To do this, first we estimated the proportion of patients in each of the 3 groups for whom the outcome was measured and compared among groups using the deviance &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. We also estimated the mean outcome level in each group and compared among groups using a Wald &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. We also assessed the possibility of selectively differential attrition across arms at each postbaseline visit. To do this, we estimated and compared the mean baseline outcome among groups for the patients who provided outcome data at that postbaseline visit. If an imbalance was found, we also produced postbaseline regression-adjusted outcome estimates by recalibrating the baseline distribution of that group to the baseline distribution across all groups combined.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In short, the overall group distribution of the baseline outcome can be estimated at each value <italic>x</italic> as 1&#x02009;/&#x02009;total sample size <italic>n</italic>.

Both integrated alcohol reduction interventions, the combined intervention and brief intervention, led to increased percentage of days abstinent from alcohol compared with standard of care; this effect was sustained during 12 months. Notably, self-reported percentage of days abstinent using the timeline follow-back interview was validated using the alcohol biomarker phosphatidylethanol. In the 12-month visit, the proportion of virally suppressed participants increased by 5% in the brief intervention group and dropped by 6% in the SOC group. In the combined intervention arm, the proportion of patients who had viral suppression stayed approximately the same across visits. The 11% difference in viral suppression between the brief intervention and SOC groups more than halved the proportion of participants who were not virally suppressed and has major clinical implications for transmission in this high-risk population.</p><p>As described elsewhere,<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> the combined intervention is more resource-intensive than the brief intervention ($30 additional cost per participant); however, the brief intervention was at least as, if not more, effective than the combined intervention on biologically validated alcohol measures and viral suppression. Part of the explanation for our findings may be that, given the lack of alcohol reduction programs in Vietnam, even 2 in-person sessions and 2 telephone sessions of alcohol reduction counseling can increase awareness of the harms of alcohol and teach coping skills to manage high risk moods and/or situations for alcohol use. Importantly, these results underscore that a brief intervention provided by paraprofessional counselors effectively reduced alcohol consumption and increased viral suppression among people with hazardous or heavy drinking being treated in ART clinics. Practical implications include integrating the brief intervention into ART clinics and screening for ART clients with hazardous drinking. Our findings highlight the need for a rigorously evaluated implementation study in multiple settings to evaluate whether the same results could be achieved in real-world settings in a wide variety of low- to middle-income countries.</p><p>Heavy alcohol use among PWH is prevalent and is associated with lower ART adherence, lower rates of viral suppression, and increased sexual and injecting risk behaviors.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200622r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200622r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> People who drink alcohol excessively may be more likely to become HIV infected.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> But higher rates of drinking among PWH is likely due in part to coping with the stress of HIV-related stigma and negative life events, such as an HIV diagnosis, as well as lack of social support.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200622r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Training in alternative means of coping may both reduce alcohol use and enhance well-being. But alcohol treatment has rarely been incorporated into HIV care settings. In the United States, a stepped alcohol treatment intervention for patients with HIV and alcohol use disorder incorporating a physician-managed medication-based intervention, motivational enhancement therapy, and referral to intensive outpatient or residential treatment led to improvements in the proportion of days abstinent and the proportion of patients with an undetectable HIV viral load at 52 weeks.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> We showed the effects of 2 counseling-only interventions on these same outcomes at 52 weeks, which, unlike physician-managed medication-based interventions, can be realistically scaled in low-resource settings. Specifically, both the combined and brief interventions have a highly structured format that are manualized and can be delivered by trained paraprofessionals. Notably, alcohol reduction and associated improvement in viral load were achieved in patients who were drinking at hazardous or heavy levels but were not seeking alcohol treatment.</p><p>At 12 months, viral suppression was significantly higher in the brief intervention group compared with the SOC group; however, the percentage of virally suppressed participants was also higher in the brief intervention group than the SOC group at baseline. After standardizing both baseline levels of viral suppression and dropout rates over time, the brief intervention group still had a significantly higher level of viral suppression compared with the SOC group. This suggests that the brief intervention reduced alcohol use, which in turn improved ART adherence, leading to greater viral suppression compared with SOC.</p><p>Our study included only individuals receiving ART and did not exclude those who had already achieved viral suppression; therefore, a high proportion of our study population already had viral suppression at baseline. We anticipate that including people who are not receiving ART and excluding those who had achieved viral suppression would increase the effect of the interventions on viral suppression. In settings where viral suppression is already high, it is important to reach the final non&#x02013;virally suppressed 10% to 15% of patients, who are often the most challenging to engage in HIV care.</p><p>Self-reported alcohol abstinence was a primary outcome, but other measures of alcohol reduction may also achieve viral suppression. Comparing the proportion of patients who reduced alcohol consumption between the SOC and combined intervention groups and the SOC and brief intervention groups at 12 months is important to understand how the interventions may operate to affect viral suppression. We found that both number of drinks per drinking day and number of heavy drinking days at 12 months were reduced in the combined and brief intervention groups compared with the SOC group, providing additional support for the effectiveness of the combined and brief interventions.</p><sec id="H2-16-ZOI200622"><title>Limitations and Strengths</title><p>This study has limitations. Self-reported alcohol abstinence is susceptible to social desirability bias. To assess the extent of this bias, we compared phosphatidylethanol level of less than 8 ng/mL, the established cut-off for abstinence, to self-reported alcohol abstinence. Only 1% to 6% reported no alcohol use in the past 21 days but had phosphatidylethanol levels of greater than 8 ng/mL, suggesting social desirability at play. However, we saw a similar percentage of those with phosphatidylethanol levels of less than 8 ng/mL who reported alcohol use in the past 21 days, suggesting possible imperfections in either or both measures that work in both directions. Therefore, while there was a strong association between phosphatidylethanol levels of less than 8 ng/mL and self-reported alcohol abstinence, it is still unclear how to best use phosphatidylethanol.</p><p>Most participants in this study were men. This was expected, given that 65% of PWH are men<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and most individuals with alcohol use disorder in Vietnam are men.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Therefore, we anticipate that our findings will generalize to our target population in Vietnam, although they may not be generalizable to other contexts in which women account for a greater proportion of PWH and people with alcohol use disorders</p><p>This study also has several strengths. The interventions were designed to be scalable. Both interventions were conducted in the very clinic settings in which they could be implemented during scale-up. By integrating into an existing structure and enrolling current ART clients, we had the opportunity to evaluate the interventions in real-world clinic settings to directly inform future scale-up.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The role of counselors can likely be fulfilled by peers, social workers, counselors, or clinicians. The counselor role did not require a high level of education, and some counselors did not have a bachelor&#x02019;s degree. Indeed, lay counselors have effectively delivered psychological treatment for men with alcohol dependence in primary care settings in India.<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Uptake of both interventions was excellent. Attendance was high compared with other trials of the combined and brief interventions<sup><xref rid="zoi200622r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and was relatively higher for the brief intervention, which was expected given the lower burden on the participants (ie, 6 in-person sessions vs 2 in-person sessions plus 2 brief telephone sessions). Duration of sessions, including the brief intervention telephone sessions, was also longer than expected, reflecting high engagement during the sessions. Counselor fidelity to the intervention manual was also acceptable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI200622"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the brief intervention, which combined in-person and telephone sessions, and the combined intervention, which included individual and group sessions, increased the percentage of days abstinent from alcohol (confirmed using phosphatidylethanol), decreased the number drinks per drinking day, and decreased the number of heavy drinking days. These effects were sustained through 52 weeks. Furthermore, the brief intervention increased viral suppression at 52 weeks. Based on the strength of the brief intervention compared with the combined intervention as well as the lower resources required to sustain the brief intervention compared with the combined intervention, implementation of the brief intervention should be a priority in other populations of ART clients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI200622"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi200622r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name name-style="western"><surname>Duko</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Ayalew</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Ayano</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group>
