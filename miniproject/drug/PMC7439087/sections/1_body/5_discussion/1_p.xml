Although pharmacological studies have demonstrated the underlying mechanisms, targets, and biological pathways to treat COVID-19, the only two targets are cathepsin L (CL)-like proteases (CL3) and ACE2. Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) is another host cell route that can be explored for possible pharmacological treatments (Suo et al., 2016).
