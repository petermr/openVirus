<p id="para0022">A TCM study was performed to accurately identify patients infected with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). In the Wanzhou District (Chongqing), 225 common and severe COVID-19 cases were analyzed. Based on TCM theory, the core pathogenesis of COVID-19 is dampness, heat, toxins, and deficiency, and the main treatment principle is strengthening the lungs to prevent dampness, clearing away heat and detoxification, supplementing qi, and nourishing Yin (
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2020</xref>). Further, there were 209 cases of COVID-19 in Chongqing City with cough (70.81%) and fever (55.50%) as the common symptoms. The primary clinical TCM pathogens are heat obstructing lung syndrome (30.14%), dampness obstructing syndrome (16.27%), and cold dampness stagnating lung syndrome (11.96%) (

In Hunan province, by the end of February 25, 2020, a total of 1016 patients were diagnosed, and 981 of these patients were treated with TCM as part of their treatment, accounting for 96.56%. Of these patients, 779 patients (95.76%) were discharged, and 233 patients were hospitalized. Among them, 233 patients were treated with TCM, accounting for 100% (

 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Except for one death in the extreme stage, the rest of the cases improved or were discharged. Qingfei Paidu decoction was most commonly used in COVID-19 treatment. Ninety-eight cases of COVID-19 in Sichuan province treated using Qingfei Paidu decoction were analyzed. After 9 days of treatment with Qingfei Paidu decoction, the total effective rate was 92.09%, the recovery rate was 41.13%, and the significant efficacy rate was 26.92% (
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In another case, in which six patients were treated using Lung-toxin Dispelling Formula (1 version) in combination with Western medicine for 16 days, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests came back negative, and the average hospitalization time was 20 days. All six patients were cured and discharged (
 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). A case of COVID-19 in Changchun that was treated using integrated TCM and Western medicine for 7 days resulted in the patient's rent recovery and discharge (
 <xref rid="bib0089" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). As of February 17, there were 60,107 confirmed cases treated using TCM in China, accounting for 85.20% of all cases. Outside Hubei, 87% of patients who were cured using TCM and discharged participated in the treatment of cases. There may be a positive correlation between the cure rate of COVID-19 and the rate of TCM use, but there are other factors that affect the cure rate of COVID-19. The exact relationship between the two needs to be further verified by science (
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Ang et al. (2020)</xref> summarized and analyzed the herbal formulae provided by the guidelines for their pattern identifications (PIs) and compositions of herbs to treat patients with COVID-19. Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2 Korean guidelines. In the frequency analysis of herbs, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Ephedrae Herba</italic>, and 
 <italic>Gypsum Fibrosum</italic> were found to be the herbs with the highest frequency of use in the Chinese guidelines.
