<p id="para0005">Infectious diseases are the demons with which human beings have been fighting since the beginning of human history. Several epidemics have occurred in the history of China.

SARS-CoV2 can be understood as the “outcry” in Wen Xie, which is of great significance for screening susceptible people.
