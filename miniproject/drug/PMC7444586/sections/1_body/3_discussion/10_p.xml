<p>Our study may have overestimated disease mortality by basing mortality rates on estimates of the crude case fatality rate in China, as suggested by a recent study [

 <sub>0</sub> as estimated through 500 runs of uncertainty analysis. The latter may have biased our reported results towards lower

 <sub>0</sub> in China was 1.95, but the point estimate assuming the baseline values of the input parameters was higher at 2.10 [
