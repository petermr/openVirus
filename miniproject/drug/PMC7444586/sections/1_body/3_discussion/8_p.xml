<p>Model 10-year age-bands were informed by available empirical evidence, which hindered analysis using narrower age intervals [

 <xref rid="pone.0237959.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] does not necessarily imply absence of infection, but may reflect rapid infection clearance or subclinical infection. This may impact our estimates depending on these infections’ degree of infectiousness. Two sensitivity analyses assuming a 50% increase in the susceptibility of younger age cohorts or equal susceptibility among those aged &lt;20 to those aged 20–29 (to somewhat reflect the effect of subclinical infections) resulted in smaller differences in

It is conceivable that such subclinical infections may have lower viral load, and therefore rapid infection clearance and limited transmission potential. Data on infection clusters from China and other countries suggested that children do not appear to play a significant role in the transmission of this infection [
