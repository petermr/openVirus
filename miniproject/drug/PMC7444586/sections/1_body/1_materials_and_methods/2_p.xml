<p>The model stratified the population into compartments according to age (0–9, 10–19, …, ≥80 years), infection status (uninfected, infected), infection stage (mild, severe, critical), and disease stage (severe, critical), using a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations (Section 1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237959.s001">S1 File</xref>). Susceptible individuals in each age group were assumed at risk of acquiring the infection at a hazard rate that varies based on the age-specific susceptibility to the infection (S1 Fig in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237959.s001">S1 File</xref>), the infectious contact rate per day, and the transmission mixing matrix between the different age groups (Section 1 in
