 <p>In December 2019, the world started to face a new pandemic situation, the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Although coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, major cardiac complications are being reported. Cardiac manifestations etiology seems to be multifactorial, comprising direct viral myocardial damage, hypoxia, hypotension, enhanced inflammatory status, ACE2‐receptors downregulation, drug toxicity, endogenous catecholamine adrenergic status, among others. Studies evaluating patients with COVID‐19 presenting cardiac injury markers show that it is associated with poorer outcomes, and arrhythmic events are not uncommon. Besides, drugs currently used to treat the COVID‐19 are known to prolong the QT interval and can have a proarrhythmic propensity. This review focus on COVID‐19 cardiac and arrhythmic manifestations and, in parallel, makes an appraisal of other virus epidemics as SARS‐CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and H1N1 influenza.</p>
