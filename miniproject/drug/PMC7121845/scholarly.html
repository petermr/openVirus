Introduction</div> <p id="Par2">India’s military is a human-intensive workforce with nearly 1.3 million defence personnel and over 2.0 million personnel in reserve. In addition, to cater to the nation’s security needs – both external and internal – India has over 1.0 million paramilitary personnel. The military personnel are deployed in diverse harsh environmental conditions to guard national sovereignty under diverse geoclimatic conditions and diverse terrains exposing them to unique conditions that are not perhaps encountered anywhere elsewhere on the globe. Homeland security is an important component of national security. The paramilitary and military personnel inevitably have to participate in low-intensity conflict (LIC) theatres also. Besides, the Indian military has always risen to the occasion and helped in disaster management, whenever there has been a natural calamity. The Indian military personnel have also been an integral part of several successful UN peacekeeping missions.</p> <p id="Par3">Keeping the physical and mental health of soldiers is paramount from an operational perspective. In addition, they need to be updated and trained to be able to utilize state-of-the-art technologies. They need to be ever vigilant, be prepared for handling any situation and protecting national interests in a rapidly changing world. In order to keep the military fighting fit for operations, there is a need to equip the soldiers with state-of-the-art technologies, often disruptive technologies, products, processes and requisite paraphernalia with a human engineering perspective to support them and handle today’s VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environment. DRDO well realizes that this can be only accomplished through continuous, concerted R&amp;amp;D with a focus on new technologies and product development, synergizing the private industry sector along with academia. Today’s military operations have to be conducted seamlessly, irrespective of environmental stressors like sub-zero temperatures, torrential rains, snow, extremes of humidity, lashing winds, extreme heat, etc. and/or in a nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) environment. In the Indian military context, the environmental hazards posed due to the geographical locale often prove more lethal to the health of a soldier than the military operation itself. More than the threat from enemy bullets is the threat of fluid loss from the body under desert conditions or frostbite and high-altitude pulmonary oedema on mountaintops in winter. High pressure of the water column can limit the performance of submariners. Even those who escape sickness may face problems of performance at altitudes in the Eastern and Western Himalayas, where the atmosphere is rarefied due to low oxygen availability. In fact in Siachen sector, more lives have been lost due to the environmental conditions rather than military operations in this ruthless sector.</p> <p id="Par4">During the combat active period, the Indian military personnel are exposed to almost all of the environmental and occupational hazards in a single lifetime. The military personnel, depending on their field of activity, are exposed to various stresses in micro-environments like engine rooms of ships, submarines, aircraft cockpits, crew compartments of tanks and other combat vehicles which are usually cramped, hot, polluted by noise, smoke and toxic gases and radiation, and hence these also pose real threats to efficient performance and health of the warfighter.</p> <p id="Par5">The operational needs of the Indian Defence Forces necessitate operations under unforgiving and inhospitable environments, which can severely impact both physical and cognitive performance of the personnel. The Life Sciences laboratories of DRDO are engaged in R&amp;amp;D with the aim to develop processes, products and technologies and effective strategies to protect and enhance the operational efficiency of the Indian Armed Forces. The mandate of the Life Sciences laboratories in Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is to optimize performance of the of the human-intensive combat force, create soldier-system fit in the various weapon development programmes and help them in meeting the unique operational requirements in conventional and nonconventional warfare situations. The R&amp;amp;D activities of the laboratories are focussed on recruitment, selection and development of appropriate human capital, development of intricate life support systems and technologies to protect against extreme and toxic/lethal environments, promotion of health and well-being of warfighter and development of strategic support systems. The fields of research encompass protective equipments and clothing, physiological-psychological aspects, protection against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) warfare and high-altitude agro-animal technologies to meet fresh food requirement of troops at high altitudes, exploiting bioenergy as emergency fuel and meeting instant food requirements for high-altitude battlefield operations.</p> <p id="Par6">Over the last five decades, the endeavours of the Life Sciences cluster of laboratories have resulted in:</p> <div class="graphic_UNKNOWN" position="anchor" id="MO1" /> <p id="Par7">The Life Sciences group of laboratories of DRDO have made significant contributions towards improving the health and performance of soldiers deployed at high altitude, cold, desert, under water, both in air and space and low-intensity conflict areas. The various labs have also made immense progress in agriculture and food technology for adverse environments such as extreme altitude, space, etc. Further, these labs are also engaged in the development of novel technologies to detect, decontaminate and protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats. Research in the various laboratories and sponsored projects cover an entire gamut of areas ranging from biomedical, food and high-altitude agro-animal and bioenergy research. Development of herbal technologies is an important area of research where attention is being focused in DRDO, in keeping with prevalence of rich traditions of diverse systems of medicine in India that have been tried, tested and proved over a period of thousands of years. Perhaps no other system of medicine has stood the test of time for such a long period.</p> </div> <div class="resurgenceofinterestinherbaltechnologiesinindia" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Resurgence of Interest in Herbal Technologies in India</div> <p id="Par8">Affordable, accessible and acceptable healthcare for all sections of society is the need of the hour. Meeting the health needs of population of over seven billion people, majority of which reside in developing/underdeveloped countries where the population just cannot afford costly healthcare, has necessitated the revival of traditional systems of medicine and the development of cost-effective and pragmatic strategies for the masses. Besides, the disease preventive as well as curative aspects of Indian herbal medicine, its safety and efficacy proved over thousands of years, have made it a preferred choice amongst the masses. The Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, has evolved as a result of years of medical practice with medicinal plants in humans. India is endowed with extremely rich biodiversity and is home to innumerable medicinal and aromatic plant species which have been used extensively to prevent and/or cure diseases. Similarly, other alternative systems of health like Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy are now officially recognized, and a ministry known as AYUSH – Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy – has been set up. In view of the huge population of India, it is imperative to develop cost-effective and sustainable health solutions for the public at large. Only one particular system of medicine cannot meet the health challenges posed by the burgeoning population. It is the author’s firm belief that we have to consider the rich, Indian traditional systems of medicine for both their preventive and therapeutic aspects and utilize them for meeting the health challenges of our country. Besides, treatments for all diseases are not available in the allopathic system of medicine. The undesirable side effects of modern medicines, the mounting costs of conventional hospital-based healthcare and the emergence of lifestyle-related diseases are some of the reasons for the population to consider alternative simpler and cheaper forms of treatment. Effective and holistic treatment for several diseases like cancer, AIDS, emerging and reemerging bacterial, fungal and viral diseases, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and several emerging and reemerging diseases are still not available in modern systems of medicine leading to more and more patients taking recourse to alternative therapies for improving the quality of life. Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> enumerates the reason why recourse to herbal medicine is the natural choice for sustainable, affordable and acceptable healthcare for the population. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="Tab1"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span> </div></p><p>Why herbal medicine is a natural choice</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th>S.

Harnessing Herbal Technologies to Meet Military Challenges: DRDO Endeavours</div> <p id="Par10">DRDO has been making concerted efforts towards research and development of herbal products with the aim of providing solutions to the unique problems faced by the Armed Forces. Some areas of research where DRDO is focussing its attention vis-à-vis herbal technology development are highlighted in Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>. Documentation of traditional knowledge on herbs of some of the inaccessible areas of the country, mainly high altitude, desert and remote regions of the country, has been carried out. Research to generate scientific data on herbs and their products are under way to explore their potential as antioxidants, immunomodulators, CBRN countermeasures and antistress agents, which would help in improving and protecting the health of troops who are exposed to various occupational and other hazards. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span></a></div>   <p>DRDO herbal technologies encompass various areas that touch the lives of the man behind the weapon in multifarious ways in their day-to-day working in difficult terrains and under various operational conditions</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="managementofhigh-altitudemaladiesencounteredbysoldiers" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Management of High-Altitude Maladies Encountered by Soldiers</div> <div class="compositeindianherbalpreparation" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Composite Indian Herbal Preparation</div> <p id="Par11">Exposure of living organisms to adverse climatic conditions is known to cause stress, which is a non-specific response to the excess demands imposed on the body. A plethora of stressors like physical, chemical, immunological, biological and emotional factors are involved in the manifestation of stress. Soldiers staying and working in adverse climatic conditions such as cold, heat and high altitude also suffer from stress-induced disorders and at times exhibit decreased or suboptimal levels of physical/cognitive performance due to stress. Adaptogens are biologically active substances that are known to improve physical and mental performance under adverse environmental conditions and induce resistance against stressors, e.g. extreme cold and heat, pain and infections. A plethora of herbals possess adaptogenic properties and are used in different traditional systems of medicine for improving overall stress resistance. Taking leads from India’s traditional system of medicine – the Ayurveda, a formulation – Composite Indian Herbal Preparation I (CIHP I) has been developed by DIPAS to increase the physical performance of our soldiers who have to operate in high-altitude environments under extremes (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). The formulation CIHP I comprises of ingredients (derived from seven different plants used in Ayurveda) and the following aqueous herbal extracts: <i>Asparagus racemosus</i> wild roots, 29.23%; <i>Withania somnifera</i> Dunal roots, 16.92%; <i>Pueraria tuberosa</i> DC tubers, 16.92%; <i>Mucuna pruriens</i> DC seeds, 8.46%; <i>Dioscorea bulbifera</i> Linn. rhizomes, 8.46%; <i>Argyreia speciosa</i> sweet whole plant, 8.46%; <i>Piper longum</i> Linn. fruit, 4.32%; and Asphalt extract 7.32%. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 2</span></a></div>   <p>Composite Indian herbal preparations: unique adaptogens</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par12">CIHP I was tested for its adaptogenic activity using C-H-R animal model. CIHP I helped in improving resistance to C-H-R-induced hypothermia and enhanced post-stress recovery to regain Trec 37 °C. In Border Security Force volunteers, CIHP I intake was found to restrict combat stress-induced deterioration in both physical and mental performance (Srivastava et al. <a href="#CR55">1996</a>). Another Composite Indian Herbal Preparation II (CIHP II), a combination of numerous plant ingredients and minerals (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>), was tested for its adaptogenic action using C-H-R animal model. The acclimatization to hypoxia of extreme altitude was facilitated by the administration of CIHP II during exposure (Grover et al. <a href="#CR33">1995</a>). Both CIHP I and II augmented oxygen delivery to biological system by increasing red cell 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid levels during hypobaric hypoxic exposure and improved cellular membrane permeability and maintenance of blood glucose and muscle glycogen levels. CIHPs also regulated the mobilization of lipids from adipose tissue and their preferential utilization for thermogenesis as compared to carbohydrates (Grover et al. <a href="#CR33">1995</a>; Kumar et al. <a href="#CR40">1999</a>, <a href="#CR41">2000</a>).

Herbal Antistress Adaptogen: DIP-91</div> <p id="Par13">Stress is a part and parcel of modern-day life. Prolonged and persistent stress can lead to psychophysiological and metabolic disorders like hypertension, diabetes, gastric ulcer, cardiovascular ailments, etc. A non-specific, antistress procedure/process and herbal or chemical intervention can help in the restoration of normal homoeostasis of the body. The soldier faces innumerable stresses while on military assignments. A potent herbal antistress adaptogen (DIP-91) has been developed for soldiers using a single herbal component, which is specifically effective in alleviating high-altitude stress (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 3</span></a></div>   <p>The herbal antistress adaptogen – DIP-91– is useful in high-altitude regions</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par14">DIP-91 has numerous benefits: (i) it acts as an anxiolytic, promotes endurance and is a potent rejuvenator/revitalizer; (ii) doesn’t alter metabolism during the resting phase; (iii) exerts adaptogenic effect only under conditions of threat to the system; (iv) possesses exceptional antioxidant potential and thereby alleviates oxidative stress; (v) possesses non-cumulative potent adaptogenic activity; (vi) is better than available products in the market (polyherbal/multicomponent preparations; and (vii) is cost-effective, non-toxic, safe and free of heavy metal-associated toxicity.</p> <p id="Par15">DIP-91 is very effective as a health food supplement/nutraceutical. It is useful for overall health and well-being under stressful situations as it improves stamina and immunity and helps in adapting to adverse environmental conditions.

Rathor et al. (<a href="#CR48">2015</a>) evaluated the mechanism of action of both the species against multiple stresses [cold-hypoxia-restraint (C-H-R)]. They reported the adaptogenic activity of <i>Hippophae salicifolia</i> in facilitating tolerance to CHR in rats. Pretreatment with <i>Hippophae salicifolia</i> significantly attenuated reactive oxygen species production, protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation and also helped maintain antioxidant status. Pretreatment of <i>Hippophae salicifolia</i> resulted in decreased protein oxidation, and protein homoeostasis was sustained by regulation of heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP60). Interestingly, heme oxygenase-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide level were also increased in <i>Hippophae salicifolia</i> pretreated rats proving its adaptogenic activity against cold-hypoxia-restraint. Conclusively, aqueous extract of <i>Hippophae salicifolia</i> could be used as an adaptogen for high-altitude-associated multiple stress. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 4</span></a></div>   <p><i>Hippophae salicifolia</i>: potential application in high-altitude stress management</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par17">Sharma et al.

Ensuring Survival in Land Locked Regions During Military Exigencies</div> <p id="Par23">The concept of survival garden has been developed by DRDO to meet the health and survival needs of the Armed Forces in case of exigencies arising locally during operations. The ethnic medicinal plant resource especially in the North West, Central and North East Himalayan region are being harnessed for this purpose.</p> <p id="Par24">The purpose of survival garden is that the soldiers should be able to utilize the locally available indigenous medicinal and aromatic plants can be utilized for treating common ailments and survival during operational conditions in diverse terrain (Fig. <a href="#Fig8">8</a>). India is extremely rich in phytobiodiversity in view of the prevailing divergent ecosystems and considerable altitudinal variations in the country. The Himalayan ranges possess huge phytobiodiversity in terms of various plant species, including angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes, bryophytes, lichens, bacteria and fungi. Of this diversity, nearly 25% species are endemic to the Himalayas. The Himalayas are considered to be a treasure house of medicinal, aromatic, edible wild and other important plants, which have been used by the local populations for meeting their daily necessities since ages, and this long dependence on plant wealth enriched their knowledge about the multifarious uses of phytodiversity. The high-altitude regions of Ladakh and Lahaul-Spiti in the North West and Tawang in the North East are strategically important because of the international borders with China and Pakistan. The Armed Forces, deployed in these regions, have to face extreme environmental conditions, as the region is prone to landslides, heavy rainfall, cloud bursts, avalanches and natural calamities. At times, these landlocked areas become inaccessible by road and/or air. In view of the likelihood of availability of food and medicines in such areas becoming compromised under certain operational conditions, a need was felt to develop databases on wild plants that can help sustenance and survival of troops in such regions in case of an emergency. The survival garden can play an important role in helping the troops operate unhindered under any circumstances. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 8</span></a></div>   <p>The survival garden for soldiers can be immensely helpful during emergency situations</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="improvingcombatperformanceandoperationalefficiency" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Herbals for Low-Intensity Conflict (LIC) Operations and Crowd Management</div> <p id="Par37">Low-intensity conflict entails armed conflict between law enforcement agencies and non-regular armed militias, which could include terrorist groups, guerrilla fighters, rioters, etc. (Chadha <a href="#CR22">2005</a>). The involvement of the local populace either overtly or covertly is a common feature of most low-intensity conflicts. The low-intensity conflicts usually involve contiguous regions/states and ultimately aim to destabilize and weaken the nation. India has witnessed several low-intensity conflicts of varying nature, degree and contexts, and these pose immense problems to law enforcement agencies in general and the military in particular for handling such issues with a sense of responsibility. Use of force under difficult inevitable circumstances often results in death or maiming of local populations leading to immense furore, e.g. the use of pellet guns to disperse mobs in North India resulted in serious eye injuries to several people. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of India ruled that being a welfare state, it is the duty of the government to ensure safety of its people as well as security forces. With a view to managing LIC operations less fatally, oleoresin-based products like Capsispray™/Capsigrenade™ – an eco-friendly, less-than-lethal weapon, based on oleoresin extract of chilli (Bhut Jolokia, <i>Capsicum assamicum</i>) developed by DRDO (Fig. <a href="#Fig16">16</a>) – can come very handy. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 16</span></a></div>   <p><i>Capsicum assamicum</i> plant (left) and fruits (right) – the source of oleoresin-based products like Capsispray™/Capsigrenade™ produced by DRDO</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par38">Capsi-based products are suitable for the law enforcement agencies, police and paramilitary forces for use in the LIC-affected areas, for riot control and for protection of vital installations from sabotage, crime prevention, flushing out hiding people as well as civilian applications like personal or area protection and self-defence. Capsi-based products can be used as a handheld spray or as a hand grenade or thrown through projectile/launchers as ball or shell or through water cannon as fine spray. They have no explosive fuse for burning chilli powder and thus do not need any approval from explosive agency.</p> <p id="Par39">One of the aims of the civil/military authorities during operations is to catch hold of the miscreants alive and get complete information about their ring leaders. Particularly when they take shelter in hideouts or in house/building, it is very difficult to take them out without collateral casualties. During counterinsurgency operations, security personnel have to disarm/incapacitate agitated individuals, disperse the crowd or capture militants held up in a bunker or building. The available methods in vogue are normally lethal in nature, e.g. small arms and grenades, which result in the loss of life/bodily injuries. There is a need for a non-lethal aerosol chemical-based weapon system, which is instantaneously effective and totally safe in controlling agitated and misguided individuals and can be used to incapacitate them leading to their capture.</p> <p id="Par40">In the Defence Research and Development Establishment (DRDE), Gwalior has developed a unique non-lethal munition, named as oleoresin-based grenades (Fig. <a href="#Fig17">17</a>). The product is totally safe, simple to operate, user-friendly and extremely useful for the above purpose. The body of the grenades is made of plastic, which melts when the grenade bursts thus making its throwing back difficult. The grenade can be thrown by hand up to 30 m to the hideouts/agitated mob. The grenades when applied emit tear gas for 60–80 s after a delay of 1–2 s, making the person come out due to lachrymation, irritation and suffocation. The product has been inducted into the services and is being used for the riot control agents by services, CAPFs, state police and other paramilitary forces.

Managing Frostbite Using Herbals</div> <p id="Par42">In snowbound areas of the high mountains, one of the major problems encountered is frostbite, which if not treated timely can lead to irreparable tissue damage leading to amputation of the affected parts. DRDO has attempted to develop appropriate prophylactics and curative measures to solve this problem often encountered by soldiers operating at high altitude. Based on extensive research, an <i>Aloe vera</i>-based cream has been developed by DRDO for the management of frostbite – the cream is non-greasy and does not cause any sweating or flaking and does not freeze even at low temperature (0 °C). Besides its application for management of cold injuries, this cream can be used for treating burns, wounds, ulcers, cracked and chapped skin and cuts and as an antiseptic dressing.</p> <p id="Par43">During trials in the Siachen glacier region, a combination of pentoxifylline, vitamin ‘C’ and low dose of aspirin along with ALOCAL (<i>Aloe vera</i> cream) application in soldiers showing early signs of cold injury was found effective in reducing morbidity (Fig. <a href="#Fig19">19</a>). Topical application of <i>Aloe vera</i> cream (50%) prophylactically along with tab aspirin 150 mg once daily, tab pentoxifylline 400 mg and tab vit C 500 mg three times daily and rewarming in decoction of tea leaves as therapy has been proved to be an effective remedy in preventing and ameliorating cold injuries in high altitude. The limbs of several soldiers were saved from amputation as a result of the use of this formulation in the cold, ruthless Siachen glacier sector. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 19</span></a></div>   <p>ALOCAL (an <i>Aloe vera</i>-based cream developed by DRDO) application in soldiers exhibiting early signs of cold injury has been found to be very effective in reducing morbidity in glacier region</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="managingdifficulttohealwounds" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Managing Difficult to Heal Wounds</div> <p id="Par44">Wound healing is classically divided into haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling. Abnormalities arising due to wound per se and during the wound repair process cause a great deal of physical and mental ordeal to patients. A unique herbal formulation, viz. Herbo Healer for management of normal as well as chronic, non-healing wounds, has been developed from a single constituent of herbal origin by the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS) – a constituent laboratory of DRDO (Fig. <a href="#Fig20">20</a>). It promotes rapid and aesthetic healing, is rich in natural antioxidants and bioactive polyphenols/flavonoids and aids in healing of wounds by acting at cellular and molecular level. It has been proven to augment healing via wound contraction, re-epithelialization, cellular proliferation, collagen accumulation and neovascularization. Herbo Healer has antibacterial properties and has been shown to be way better than silver sulfadiazine and other iodine-based ointments. The safety and toxicological studies have proven it to be safe for dermal applications.

Prevention Against Snakebites</div> <p id="Par45">Snakebites are common in jungles and pose environmental hazard that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, if the snake is poisonous and the individual is not timely treated with anti-snake venom (Singh et al. <a href="#CR52">2008</a>). The soldiers have to operate in jungles, where wildlife is in plenty. For the military, it is definitely an occupational hazard. The best method to reduce human-snake encounters is to be cautious and avoid them; however, this is not always possible in snake-infested areas, and snake repellents can be quite useful in such scenarios. Murdock et al. (<a href="#CR45">1990</a>) and Krysa-clark et al.

The formulation is eco-friendly; it does not harm the snake, it only repels the snake so that it goes away from the area where the formulation has been used. The formulation is available in liquid and granular form; it can be used in gardens and home also. The formulation is of herbal origin and has a shelf life of 1 year under any environment conditions. Ethnic herbs, mainly from eastern India, have been used to develop the formulation. The formulation is non-toxic, non-hazardous and non-mutagenic and contains no phenolic compounds.

Herbals for Alleviating Seasickness</div> <p id="Par47">Seasickness is a form of motion sickness; it is hardly fatal, but symptoms such as nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting caused can be quite debilitating, affecting performance of the seafarers. In critical military operations, seasickness can impede mission accomplishment. The Indian Navy had reported that the Somalian pirates use a plant called khat (<i>Catha edulis</i>) for alleviating symptoms of seasickness and improving performance. <i>Catha edulis</i> is native to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa">Horn of Africa</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, where khat chewing is a social custom dating back thousands of years. <i>Catha</i> (khat) contains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine">monoamine</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid">alkaloid</a> – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathinone">cathinone</a> (an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine">amphetamine</a>-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant">stimulant</a>), which causes excitement, appetite loss and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(emotion)">euphoria</a>.

Radiological/Nuclear Countermeasures</div> <p id="Par49">Attempts have been made by various researchers to classify radioprotectors into different categories. However, there is no universal classification that is unanimously acceptable. A radioprotector can be defined as a substance [element, chemical or a compound of synthetic or molecular nature or biological compound(s)] that reduces the deleterious effects of radiation, when administered to living organisms, usually prior to irradiation (prophylactic administration), while radiorecovery agents are those that help in recuperation and augment recovery once the living organism has been exposed to radiation. Most agents available today fall in the former category. Since the damage resulting due to ionizing radiation in most cases cannot be totally reversed, the currently available radiorecovery agents exhibit limited efficacy. There is immense interest now to develop both categories of agents so that radiation damage can be treated holistically.</p> <p id="Par50">Vasin <a href="#CR64">1999</a> of the Institute of Aviation and Space Medicine, Moscow, classified prophylactic antiradiation drugs into the following categories: (i) drugs having short-term and long-term action drugs, (ii) drugs that stimulate radioresistance, (iii) drugs that suppress symptoms of primary radiation reaction, (iv) drugs that detoxify early and (v) drugs that act by absorption or elimination of radionuclides from an organism. Nair et al. (<a href="#CR46">2001</a>) have classified radioprotective agents into three categories: (i) radioprotectors, (ii) adaptogens and (iii) absorbents. Radioprotectors include compounds like antioxidants and others that possess sulfhydryl groups. Adaptogens in general are non-toxic stimulators of radioresistance. Usually these are natural biological protectors that offer protection against low levels of ionizing radiation primarily by regulating immunity and modulating the endogenous antioxidants, thereby improving non-specific resistance in biological systems. The last category comprises of absorbents that protect against internal radiation injuries that result due to ingestion of radionuclides. Such agents prevent the incorporation and absorption of radionuclides like <sup>90</sup>Sr, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>239</sup>Pu, <sup>131</sup>I, etc. A large number of plant-derived compounds are known to possess highly effective absorbent capability.</p> </div> <div class="thehigh-altitudehimalayanplantspeciesasradiationcountermeasureagents(fig.23)" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

In modern systems of medicine, podophyllotoxin finds use as a precursor for the semi-synthetic anticancer drugs etoposide, teniposide and etopophos and other antiarthritic drugs. These drugs and other derivatives, based on podophyllotoxin, find use for the treatment of leukaemia, Kaposi’s sarcoma, lung and testicular cancers, dermatological disorders like warts, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, malaria, etc. In ancient Indian traditional system of medicine, <i>Ayurveda</i> plant has been mentioned as ‘Aindri’ – a divine drug in ancient literature (Singh and Shah <a href="#CR01">1994</a>). <i>Podophyllum hexandrum</i> has been used as a cure for allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin; biliary fever; burning sensation; cold; constipation; cancer of the brain, bladder and lung; erysipelas; Hodgkin’s disease; insect bites; mental disorders; monocytoid leukaemia; non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; rheumatism; septic wounds plague; and venereal warts since ages (Chatterjee and Pakrashi <a href="#CR24">1996</a>).</p> <p id="Par53">The radioprotective properties of <i>Podophyllum hexandrum</i> have been evaluated in detail at INMAS.

The radioprotective and anti-HIV properties are further likely to increase the demand for lignans and related molecules produced by this important plant species. In order to maintain continued production of these aryltetralin lignans, the plant has to be harvested on a large scale from its natural environment, and this has resulted in the plant’s endangered status, which now finds mention in the Red Data Book. The chemical synthesis of podophyllotoxin is complicated, and in view of the difficulties in its total chemical synthesis (due to the presence of four chiral centres along with a γ-lactone and a high degree of oxygenation), problems in cultivation on large scale and failure of metabolic engineering approaches, there is a need for alternative sources of production of aryltetralin lignans. To circumvent the problem of production of radioprotective secondary metabolites, a novel endophytic fungus (<i>Trametes hirsuta</i>) was isolated from high-altitude <i>P. hexandrum</i> with the capability to synthesize podophyllotoxin and other lignans and possessing amenability for scale-up in bioreactors (Puri et al. <a href="#CR47">2006</a>; Fig. <a href="#Fig29">29</a>). Methodology for consistent production of the aryltetralin lignans was established, and methods for characterization by HPLC, LC–MS, LC/MS–MS and 1H-NMR were developed and standardized. The lignans produced by the endophyte are biologically active and exhibited significant antioxidant, anticancer and radioprotective properties. This strategy promises to improve the production of these therapeutically important high-value bioactive radioprotective secondary metabolites at lower costs. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 29</span></a></div>   <p>Isolation of the endophytic fungus <i>Trametes hirsuta</i> from <i>Podophyllum hexandrum</i></p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="biothreatcountermeasures" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Biothreat Countermeasures</div> <p id="Par65">The rapid development of antimicrobial resistance amongst microbes poses serious public health concerns. As per the WHO, antibiotic resistance is a major threat to global health, food security and development in today’s scenario. Though antibiotic resistance develops in microbes naturally, the extensive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in humans and animals accelerates the process leading to the development of antibiotic resistance leading to plethora of microbes becoming drug-resistant posing grave concerns to humanity. Increasingly, diseases like pneumonia, tuberculosis and gonorrhoea are becoming harder to treat as the antibiotics used to treat them are becoming ineffective. Antibiotic resistance is fast becoming a major problem necessitating to longer stays in hospital and resulting in higher medical costs and increased mortality. Developing countries cannot afford the additional financial burden posed by this major problem. In addition, multidrug-resistant microbes can also pose biothreat concerns if used inappropriately by certain nefarious people to disrupt military as well as civil populations.</p> <p id="Par66">With antibiotic resistance becoming more prevalent and the consequent evolution of more virulent strains, there would be very few effective antimicrobial drugs available in our armamentarium to tackle antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and patients might succumb to even simple infections as they would become untreatable. It is under such conditions that herbal medicine could be used as an alternative therapy for treatment.</p> <p id="Par67">Multiple drug resistance (MDR) refers to the resistance shown by a species of microorganism to multiple antimicrobial drugs. Several terms recognizing the varying degrees of MDR encountered have been introduced, e.g. drug resistant (XDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR). A plethora of antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been reported, including community- and hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate <i>S. aureus</i> (VISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, macrolide- and penicillin-resistant <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, extend-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CREs) and multidrug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Acinetobacter</i> spp. (Fig. <a href="#Fig30">30</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 30</span></a></div>   <p>The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a major challenge that needs to be tackled on priority basis (Photo Credit: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH)</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par68">The multidrug resistance offered by carbapenem-resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> (CRE) (family: Enterobacteriaceae; class: Gammaproteobacteria) against third-line antibiotics can be attributed to its ability to develop biofilm(s). Such process involves adhesion and quorum-sensing induced colonization, leading to biomass development. Studies conducted at INMAS by our group have explored the anti-adhesion, anti-quorum sensing and anti-biofilm potential of 05 pre-standardized potent herbals (Thakur et al. <a href="#CR62">2016a</a>,<a href="#CR63">b</a>). <i>Berberis aristata</i> (PTRC-2111-A) exhibited maximum potential vis-à-vis these activities, while <i>Holarrhena antidysenterica</i> (PTRC-8111-A) showed only anti-quorum sensing potential as compared to standards/antibiotics. These findings are in line with the molecular docking analysis of phytoligands against Lux S and Pilin receptors. Additionally, pairwise correlation analysis of the tested activities with qualitative, quantitative and bioactivity functional descriptors revealed that an increased content of alkaloid, moderate content of flavonoids and decreased content of tannins supported anti-adhesion, anti-quorum sensing and anti-biofilm potential activities. Besides, nitric oxide and superoxide scavenging activity correlated with anti-quorum sensing activity. The findings indicated clearly that <i>B. aristata</i> (family: Berberidaceae) and <i>C. sinensis</i> (family: Theaceae) are potent herbals with significant therapeutic potential for the management of CREs (Fig. <a href="#Fig31">31</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 31</span></a></div>   <p>Cell ultrastructure disruption as revealed by scanning electron microscopy upon treatment with <i>B. aristata</i></p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par69">Further we carried out studies using an aquo-ethanolic extract of <i>Camellia sinensis</i> (PTRC-31911-A), standardized using Fourier-transform infrared analysis, which revealed the presence of seven common functional groups (Thakur et al. <a href="#CR62">2016a</a>,<a href="#CR63">b</a>). Combinations of PTRC-31911-A with third-line antibiotics (n = 5) were tested against carbapenem-resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Combination modality revealed synergistic behaviour (fractional inhibitory concentration indices &amp;lt; 1) with tigecycline, ertapenem, meropenem, colistin and augmentin. The lead combination of PTRC-31911-A + ertapenem or meropenem showed maximum augmentative potential at a dose of 50 and 100 μg/mL, respectively, with nearly fivefold decrease in minimum inhibitory concentrations as compared with the respective antibiotics alone. The synergistic effects implied that the antibacterial combinations of PTRC-31911-A and ertapenem, meropenem, colistin, tigecycline or augmentin are more effective than monotherapy with either of these antibiotics.</p> </div> <div class="herbalprophylacticsandtherapeuticagents:preparingforworst-casescenarios" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Herbal Prophylactics and Therapeutic Agents: Preparing for Worst-Case Scenarios</div> <p id="Par70">Life-threatening opportunistic infections or biothreat agents can wreak havoc in individuals with inflammatory conditions if they are treated with available conventional therapies, and this has raised concerns in the management of national security (Tanwar et al. <a href="#CR59">2016</a>). Highest priority opportunistic pathogens like <i>Salmonella species</i>, <i>Brucella abortus</i>, etc. pose a risk to national security as they can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, which can further result in high mortality rates amongst the vulnerable populations. These pathogens in turn also play an important role in the initiation and perpetuation of such inflammatory conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and neurological disorders) in susceptible community. However, the use of biologic therapies (corticosteroids, NSAIDS, DMARDS) is also associated with increased risk of infections with intracellular microorganisms like <i>Salmonella</i> spp., <i>E. coli</i>, etc. (Thakur et al. <a href="#CR62">2016a</a>,<a href="#CR63">b</a> and Tanwar et al. <a href="#CR60">2017a</a>,<a href="#CR61">b</a>). Further, the combination therapy of corticosteroids and conventional drugs like anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, aspirin, diclofenac) etc. was shown to have antagonistic effects. Nowadays, the management of inflammatory conditions requires aggressive treatment with existing conventional drugs. Due to an increase in the unwanted effects of such therapeutic modalities, alternative therapies, particularly herbal, need to be explored as a curative remedy for the management of such vulnerable condition in terms of ‘worst-case scenario’ (Thakur et al. <a href="#CR62">2016a</a>). With this aim in mind, endeavours were made to identify and develop natural remedies that could be employed in worst-case scenarios (mainly in susceptible population) to modulate the deleterious effects of natural disease outbreaks or deliberate use of biothreat agents. A herbal informatics evidence-based matrix modelling approach was envisaged, and this unique approach utilized the in silico bioprospection for identification of potent herbal leads. The model was developed using PubMed-based dynamic search engines as interactive platform. The priority index algorithms were used as a basis for evaluation of relevance factor of various physiological targets or bioactivity parameters specific to a particular microorganism(s) or inflammatory condition(s) in conferring antibiotic resistance over a period of time (Chakotiya et al. <a href="#CR07">2016</a>; Tanwar et al. <a href="#CR60">2017a</a>,<a href="#CR61">b</a>). Similarly, the potential herbals identified the basis of classical bioprospection were subjected to binary, weightage and fuzzy set-based analysis using assigned relevance to each activity parameter as dependent variable. The final optimized matrix provided several potential herbal leads. These identified leads were further carried forward for evaluation of their antimicrobial activity as well as anti-inflammatory potential against a novel standardized ‘vulnerable animal model’ (collagen type II-induced rheumatoid arthritis in combination with opportunistic infections involving multidrug resistant pathogens as worst-case scenario) (Tanwar et al. <a href="#CR60">2017a</a>,<a href="#CR61">b</a>). The identified herbal leads (e.g. <i>Camellia sinensis</i>, <i>Berberis aristata</i>, <i>etc.</i>) could be utilized as novel holistic drugs in the future for the management of biothreats posed, particularly in vulnerable populations.</p> </div> <div class="broad-spectrumantiviraldrugs" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Drugs</div> <p id="Par71">There is a dearth of antiviral drugs in modern systems of medicine due to the rapid rate of mutation found in viruses. Viral pathogens pose a serious threat, especially the clinical viruses (HIV, hepatitis viruses, etc.), natural emerging viruses (avian and swine influenza strains, SARS, novel H1N1, H1N5, etc.) and viruses relevant to potential bioterrorism (Ebola, smallpox, etc.) (Rider et al. <a href="#CR49">2011</a>). Unfortunately, there are relatively few prophylactics or therapeutics available for management of viral diseases and pandemics (Arora et al. <a href="#CR18">2010f</a>, <a href="#CR20">2011</a>). A plethora of medicinal plants exhibit promise for the treatment of viral infections, as several of them possess potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Arora et al. <a href="#CR20">2011</a>, <a href="#CR21">2013</a>). In the past, evaluation of antiviral activity of medicinal plants was constrained in view of the highly infectious nature of viruses and lack of suitable separation techniques for the identification of antiviral components. Development of vector-based strategies, in which non-infectious molecular clone of a virus is used for antiviral screening purposes and advancement in separation technologies, has offered promise for medicinal plants usage in modern antiviral drug discovery (Mukhtar et al. <a href="#CR44">2008</a>). With increase in the virulence of viruses, emergence of new viral strains and non-availability of broad-spectrum synthetic drugs, there is a need to explore plants for the development of new and potent antiviral drugs.</p> <p id="Par72">DRDO has been engaged in the development of new candidate drugs for treating viral infections. <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> has been tested for its anti-dengue potential (Jain et al. <a href="#CR38">2008</a>). Dengue virus occurs as four distinct serotypes, viz. dengue 1, 2, 3 and 4. Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges from a self-limited febrile illness and dengue fever to a more severe disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Medical treatment of dengue poses serious issues as virtually no targeted therapeutic agents are available to treat the disease and consequently whatever treatment is given is mostly supportive in nature. Jain et al. (<a href="#CR38">2008</a>) evaluated the anti-dengue activity of <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> leaf extract in dengue virus type II infected blood-derived human macrophages. The dengue virus-infected cells were treated with <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> leaf extract and compared with the commercially available antiviral drug – ribavirin. The extract was able to maintain the cell viability of dengue-infected cells at par with ribavirin, along with the decrease and increase in TNF-α and IFN-γ, respectively. Anti-dengue activity of <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> extract was further determined by the traditional plaque assay. The results suggested that the <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> leaf extract has significant anti-dengue activity and has potential for the treatment of dengue.</p> <p id="Par73">Understanding and modulating the signal transduction pathways are imperative to the development of new therapeutic agents. It is well known that the recognition of virus infection by retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG) I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein (MDA) 5, which are RNA helicases, and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 can activate a cascade of signal transduction pathways leading to production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines that synchronize the removal of the virus from the host. However, it has been demonstrated that RNA-helicase-mediated innate immunity plays an important role in defending the host from infection. During endeavours to identify plant-derived antivirals that could selectively enhance ISG- and RNA-helicase-mediated antiviral immune responses, <i>Rhodiola</i> was found to be effective. <i>Rhodiola</i> treatment significantly promoted ISG, RIG-I and MDA 5 gene expression and an antiviral immune response against dengue virus infection. <i>Rhodiola</i> treatment also induced interferon (IFN) β and other cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 in infected cells. <i>Rhodiola</i> also upregulated phosphorylated eIF-2α, PKR and NF-kB in infected cells. In addition, the number of NK cells was also increased upon treatment with <i>Rhodiola</i> in dengue virus-infected human PBMCs. Based on the studies, Diwaker et al. (<a href="#CR30">2014</a>) demonstrated that <i>Rhodiola</i> induces pharmacological modulation of RIG-I, MDA 5 and ISG signal transduction pathways supporting the induction of a favourable antiviral immune response against dengue virus and, can, therefore, be a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of dengue infection.</p> </div> <div class="chemicalwarfarecountermeasures" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Chemical Warfare Countermeasures</div> <p id="Par74">Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) can pose problems during military conflicts and terrorism since most CWA and TIC exposures are difficult to manage as these agents have a rapid onset of action and can kill, injure or incapacitate human beings within no time. The mostly unprepared individuals get affected almost immediately; the first responders can get accidentally exposed, and the population in the vicinity can get affected rapidly. The specific mode of toxicity of these agents is varied; they are often mediated either directly or indirectly with increased oxidative stress in biological systems. Consequently, a plethora of antioxidants have been explored as potential medical countermeasures for CWA/TIC exposures. In DRDO, studies have been performed with a diverse array of CWAs, model organisms, exposure systems, target organs and antioxidants, looking at an almost equally assorted set of endpoints. Endeavours at treating CWAs/TICs with antioxidants have often met with mixed results, though exploration of antioxidants as medical countermeasures for CWA/TIC management has shown some potential. A plethora of herbal drugs have been utilized for their protective efficacy against chemical warfare agents, including extremely toxic sulphur mustard (SM). Ethanolic extract of <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> leaf (HL-EOH), water and ethanolic extract of <i>H. rhamnoides</i> fruit (HF-W and HF-EOH) and <i>H. rhamnoides</i> flavone from fruit (HR-flavone) were evaluated against percutaneously administered sulphur mustard (Vijayaraghavan et al. <a href="#CR65">2006</a>). The <i>H. rhamnoides</i> extracts (1 g/kg; 3 doses; po) significantly protected SM-induced lethality. Following percutaneous administration of sulphur mustard, reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione levels decreased, and malondialdehyde was elevated. Oral administration of HL-EOH and HR-flavone significantly protected against loss of body weight. Following oral administration of ethanolic leaf extract and HR-flavone, recovery GSH, GSSG and MDA levels were recorded. The authors concluded that percutaneous administration of sulphur mustard induces oxidative stress, and ethanolic extract of leaf of <i>H. rhamnoides</i> and <i>H. rhamnoides</i> flavone from fruit can significantly protect against sulphur mustard-induced toxicity.</p> <p id="Par75">Prophylactic effect of gossypin (3,3′,4′,5,7,8-hexahydroxyflavone 8-glucoside) – an anti-inflammatory compound widely used as a herbal remedy for treating diabetes, jaundice, inflammation melanoma and glioma – has been demonstrated against percutaneously administered sulphur mustard in mice (Gautam and Vijayaraghavan <a href="#CR31">2007</a>).</p> <p id="Par76">Various antioxidants like trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) and quercetin have been shown to protect the liver and lung tissues from oxidative damage caused by sulphur mustard exposure through inhalation and percutaneous routes (Kumar et al. <a href="#CR42">2001</a>).

They are constantly exposed to a variety of bloodsucking insects such as mosquitoes, blackflies, ticks, mites, rat flea, sandflies and leeches during their operational postings. Insects are carriers (vectors) of dreaded diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, etc. Various methods have been used for the ecological condition with certain limitations. Application of insecticide residual spraying causes inconvenience to children and older persons and can cause toxicity. A better method would be to use personal protection measures to protect human from the painful bites of bloodsucking organisms such as mosquito, sandfly, blackfly, rat flea and bedbugs.</p> <p id="Par79">Amongst vectors, mosquitoes are responsible for causing major vector-borne diseases in India and other tropical countries.

DRDO has been making concerted efforts to consolidate and streamline research and development endeavours on herbal products to provide unique solutions to the Armed Forces. In the process, at times some spin-offs emanate, which find practical application in both military and civil setting. With a view to meeting emerging challenges, the traditional knowledge on herbs of high altitudes, desert areas, Central Himalayan and North East region, etc. is being documented, and research carried out to generate scientific data that can be useful for the Armed Forces. There is a paradigm shift towards acceptance of scientifically validated herbals as effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents. The grant of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to discoveries concerning novel therapies for some of the most devastating parasitic diseases, viz. river blindness, lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) and malaria, has once again highlighted the importance that herbal drugs are receiving in today’s world. Drugs derived from <i>Streptomyces avermitilis</i> and <i>Artemisia annua</i> were found to be effective against parasitic diseases. However, it is a paradox that in our country, where Ayurveda has been a very successful and effective system of medicine for over 5000 years, there is still some amount of scepticism among civil health experts when it comes to acceptance of herbal drugs, and services are no exception.. This view has to change in coming times if the full benefit of scientifically validated herbal drugs has to reach the users. The realization that herbal drugs are effective and safe and can solve the emerging problems of our Armed Forces will lead to induction of more and more products to the advantage of our soldiers who operate in harsh and extreme terrain and inhospitable operational conditions. As alluded to earlier, serious endeavours are underway in DRDO towards protecting the warfighter and promoting performance through the development of scientifically validated herbal products, processes and technologies. The need of the hour is achieving greater synergy with the services and industrial partners so that the herbal products, technologies and complementary and alternative medicine can be inducted in a rapid manner for the benefit of the soldiers.</p> </div> <div class="disclaimer" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
