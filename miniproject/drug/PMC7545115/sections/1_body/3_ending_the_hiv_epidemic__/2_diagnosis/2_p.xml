<p>In Texas, the percentage of people undiagnosed is higher (18.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.4%–23.7%) compared with the national average (14.2%; 95% CI, 12.5%–15.7%) [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as is the rate of new HIV diagnoses (15.7/100 000 vs 11.4/100 000) [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Although the diagnosis rate has modestly decreased over time, the proportion of new diagnoses have increased among blacks and Hispanics/Latinx [
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Stage 3 (AIDS) at the time of diagnosis among the Hispanics/Latinx in Texas is higher than the national average (22.9% vs 21.4%) [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast, the overall care linkage at 1 (73% vs 78.3%) and 3 (83.2% vs 86.8%) months is lower [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The gaps in the national targets for HIV testing are even wider in Texas [
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Overall, 46.9% (95% CI, 46.3%–47.5%) of adults aged ≥18 years in the 50 jurisdictions had ever been tested during 2016–2017. By comparison, the percentage ever tested in Texas exceeded the 50-jurisdiction aggregate in only Travis County (50.2% vs 46.9%), whereas the other counties lagged behind (Bexar 45.1%, Dallas 44.2%, Harris 45.9%, and Tarrant 46%). Likewise, the percentage tested in the past year fell short of the aggregate (14.5%; 95% CI, 14%–14.9%) in all counties (Bexar 13.7%, Dallas 14.4%, Harris 13.2, Tarrant 11.6%, and Travis 12.3%). Thus, substantial escalation and prioritization of HIV testing for diagnosis and linkage to prevention and care is required.
