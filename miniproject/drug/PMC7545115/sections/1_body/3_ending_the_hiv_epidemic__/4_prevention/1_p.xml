<p>The prevention pillar embodies the protection of individuals at risk for HIV using proven methods, especially oral ARV PrEP, which is highly efficacious against HIV acquisition among all populations [

 <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Of those, 95.5% were males and 39% were aged 25–34 years, whereas 24%, 17%, and 15% were 35–44, 45–54, and ≤24 years old, respectively. These data underscore the urgent and severe need for PrEP scale-up among at-risk individuals and the addressal of PrEP disparities that adversely affect minorities, youth, and women in Texas. Uptake of other biomedical interventions [
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], including condom use, needle exchange, and drug rehabilitation, requires concomitant scale-up. Finally, a deeper understanding of the risk factors for HIV acquisition and transmission plus the knowledge, access, positive attitudes, and practices of PrEP and other interventions are crucial for augmenting HIV prevention in Texas.
