 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. New diagnoses have been relatively stable (&gt;4000 annually) for over a decade, with a modest decrease in rates from 17.7/100 000 in 2009 to 15.7/100 000 in 2018, which are highest among males (26/100 000), blacks (46/100 000), and 25- to 29-year-olds (45.2/100 000). Men who have sex with men and MSM who inject drugs accounted for 74% of new diagnoses, followed by heterosexuals (21%) and other people who inject drugs (5%). The proportion of diagnoses in 2018 compared with 2009 decreased among black heterosexual women (8.1% vs 10.9%), remained stable among white MSM (14.3% vs 14.8%), but increased among transgender persons (1.1% vs 0.7%) and black (21.4% vs 19.2%) and Hispanic/Latino (30.3% vs 23.6%) MSM. Late diagnoses (stage 3/AIDS within 3 months of diagnoses) have also decreased over time (19.9% vs 29.1%) [
