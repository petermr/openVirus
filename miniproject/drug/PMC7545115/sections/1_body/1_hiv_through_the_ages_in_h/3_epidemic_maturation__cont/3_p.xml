<p>On the societal front, in the 2003 landmark civil rights case, Lawrence v. Texas, the US Supreme Court struck down the sodomy law in Texas in a 6 to 3 decision and, by extension, invalidated sodomy laws in 13 other states, legalizing same-sex sexual activity across the nation [

This ruling not only supported the civil rights and emancipation of the LGBTQ community, but it also facilitated the historic legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015. Nevertheless, PWH have been prosecuted in Texas for HIV exposure under criminal laws, including attempted murder and aggravated assault, with consideration of bodily fluids as a deadly weapon because of HIV-positive status [
