<p>Houston became an AIDS epicenter with a record number of cases, fourth highest for several years, nationwide [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At the public MDACC, there was an explosive increase in the volume of AIDS patients in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Here, Peter Mansell and Guy Newell, physicians in the department of cancer prevention, spearheaded AIDS prevention studies and public education efforts [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on the prevailing healthcare needs and opportunities, American Medical International Inc. (AMI), a for-profit hospital corporation that owned 11 hospitals in Houston, successfully proposed to the University of Texas (UT) System and MDACC, the conversion of AMI’s Citizens General Hospital to a unique, freestanding, dedicated AIDS hospital [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Predicated on such a facility, and with Peter Mansell as the principal investigator and coinvestigators including Evan Hersh, James Reuben, Blaine Hollinger, and UT Health Science Center School of Public Health (Dean, R. Palmer Beasley), MDACC became a recipient of the first 14 AIDS Treatment and Evaluation Unit (ATEU) Grants countrywide. The 5-year ($5.8 million) grant was awarded for both basic science and clinical AIDS research, by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, the nation’s first AIDS hospital, the Institute for Immunological Disorders, opened on August 1, 1986, under the leadership of Peter Mansell (medical director), Daniel Moreschi (operations), and Adan Rios (clinical research) [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Grounded in MDACC’s philosophy of cancer care, the Institute pioneered the now established, outpatient model for HIV care and paved the way for humane treatment and development of therapies for HIV and related malignancies [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unfortunately, the Institute was shut down by AMI, just 15 months later, on December 11, 1987, due to heavy financial loss ($8 million) and dire operational challenges [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The drivers for this included the following: Institute’s inconvenient location and difficult transportation (~20 miles from inner city and MDACC); disrepute of Citizens General Hospital; inadequate support from local community, private practitioners, and public health officials; meager resources for indigent patients; and underutilization of inpatient services due to an outpatient-, home-, and/or hospice-based model of care [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This shutdown was not only a major setback for Houston’s AIDS response but also a fatal blow to the Houston ATEU. The MDACC did not revive its former AIDS clinic nor did any other medical institution step forward, to enable ATEU’s continued operation [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, MDACC returned the residual grant funds ($4 million) to the NIH, leaving the epicenter Houston without an ATEU, and branding the city with a bad track record and the state with a nonserious reputation about AIDS [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Subsequently, MDACC swapped its Railroad Hospital on Thomas Street, with land at Holcombe Street owned by the Harris County Hospital District ([HCHD] currently named the Harris Health System). Thus, the Thomas Street Hospital for AIDS patients was created in 1989, that later became established as the Thomas Street Health Center (TSHC) [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The late Robert Awe, a pulmonologist at the Baylor College of Medicine, was a long-time AIDS activist, founder of Omega House (hospice), and medical director of HCHD’s Jefferson Davis Hospital (closed since 1991) and its AIDS clinic, the city’s first [

 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], he declined to direct TSHC upon its inception, to draw attention to insufficient commitment of funds and personnel [
