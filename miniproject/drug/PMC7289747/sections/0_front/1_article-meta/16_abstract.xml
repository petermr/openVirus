 <p>The 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from human to human has recently reported in China. Now COVID-19 has been spread all over the world and declared epidemics by WHO. It has caused a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Due to the rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections and unavailability of antiviral therapeutic agents, developing an effective SAR-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently required. SARS-CoV-2 which is genetically similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising 29,891 nucleotides, which encode the 12 putative open reading frames responsible for the synthesis of viral structural and nonstructural proteins which are very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. In this review we have summarized various vaccine candidates i.e., nucleotide, subunit and vector based as well as attenuated and inactivated forms, which have already been demonstrated their prophylactic efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, so these candidates could be used as a potential tool for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
