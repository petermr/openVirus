<p>The authors of this paper are members of a working group created by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) in 2017 to enhance their efforts to educate and advocate on the urgent need to better prevent and treat serious infections linked to the opioid and stimulant epidemics and underlying SUD. The working group developed a policy agenda reflecting issues raised by infectious diseases and HIV physicians and health care professionals working at the intersection of infectious diseases and opioid use disorder (OUD) and other SUD epidemics more broadly. In this paper, we outline practice and policy suggestions that are likely to positively impact the OUD, stimulant epidemics, and infectious diseases epidemics, and that have been reviewed and approved by the IDSA and HIVMA Board of Directors as a call to action for infectious diseases and HIV practitioners.</p>
