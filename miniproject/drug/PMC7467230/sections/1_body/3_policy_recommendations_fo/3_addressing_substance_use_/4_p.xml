<p>Substance use treatment coupled with uninterrupted health insurance is needed to improve outcomes among persons who are released from jail and prison. As a case study, expansion of HCV treatment during incarceration is feasible, cost-effective, and the best option to move closer to national HCV elimination [

 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. A major barrier in HCV linkage to care postrelease is that 90% of states have policies that withdraw enrollment in insurance programs when people are incarcerated, outsourcing health care to medical corporations hired by criminal justice administrators [
 <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Prior to release, there are often attempts to reestablish health insurance, but this is complex because of uncertainty around the date of release and place the person will live. The process of re-entry is a vulnerable time for people who are incarcerated, with high mortality related to drug use but also associated with suboptimal postrelease management of chronic conditions like liver disease [
