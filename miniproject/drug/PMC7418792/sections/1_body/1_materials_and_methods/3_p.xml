<p id="par0065">The raw read data were aligned on the complete (29,891 bp) SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (GenBank accession no. MN975262.1, isolate 2019-nCoV_HKU-SZ-005b_2020) using bowtie2 v2.3.0 [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], after quality check with FastQC v0.11.5 [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The resulting alignments were visualized with the 
 <italic>Integrated Genomics Viewer</italic> (IGV) v2.3.60 [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. After removing PCR duplicates, SNVs were called with a Bonferroni-corrected 
 <italic>P</italic>-value threshold of 0.05 using 
 <italic>samtools</italic> v1.7 (htslib1.7.2) [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and 
 <italic>LoFreq</italic> v2.1.5. LoFreq is a very accurate SNV caller especially designed for viral and bacterial genomes; its performance depends on the sequencing depth and the quality of the NGS reads. For the datasets analyzed in this study (average read depth 133.5x – 598.2x) and based on the assessed read quality &gt; Q30 = 88.2–92.7%, LoFreq has calling sensitivity = ∼1% and PPV = 100 [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Variants supported by absolute read concordance (&gt;98 %) were filtered-out from intra-host variant frequency calculations. Four SNVs from sample SRR10903402 and 3 SNVs from sample SRR10971381 with statistically significant strand bias (
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) were also excluded from further analyses. Variations were annotated to the reference genome using snpEff v4.3p [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], SNVs effects were further filtered with snpSift v4.3p [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the average mutation rate per gene across the viral genome was estimated using R scripts (v3.6.2) in RStudio v1.1.456. The colocalization of the intra-host SNVs and population level SNPs retrieved from

 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The impact of these SNVs on the binding affinity of primers and probes to their genomic targets, was predicted using FastPCR 3.3.28 [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and DINAMelt webserver [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To investigate intra-host genomic rearrangements, 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes was performed using Spades v3.13.1 [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Spades outperforms most modern de novo assemblers in terms of viral genome retrieval and coverage, presenting the highest sensitivity (99.48 %) [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The resulting contigs were analyzed with BLAST v2.6.0 [
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and confirmed by remapping of the raw reads, setting a threshold of 5 not replicated reads for contigs suggesting rearrangements. Smaller contigs (&lt;200 bp) were elongated where possible, after pair-wise realignment of the corresponding mapped reads. Basic computations and visualizations were implemented in R programming language v3.6.2, using in-house scripts. The secondary structures of the genomic regions surrounding the recombination breakpoints were predicted using RNAfold webserver [
