<p id="par0110">As it is well documented, recombination events lead to substantial changes in genetic diversity of RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In CoVs, discontinuous RNA synthesis is commonly observed, resulting in high frequencies of homologous recombination [
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], which can be up to 25 % across the entire CoV genome [
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. For pathogenic HCoVs genomic rearrangements are frequently reported during the course of epidemic outbreaks, such as HCoV-OC43 [
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and HCoV-NL63 [
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. We have isolated intra-host genomic rearrangements, located in poly-A and poly-U enriched palindrome regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We conclude that these rearrangements do not represent artifacts derived from the NGS library preparation (e.g. PCR crosstalk artifacts), especially since all the supporting reads were not duplicated and, in some cases, differed in polymorphic positions (Suppl. Fig. 1).
