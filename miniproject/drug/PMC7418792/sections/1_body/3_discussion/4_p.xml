<p id="par0105">SNVs and quasispecies observed at low frequency could represent viral variations of low impact on the functionality of the genome. Bal et al., suggest that development of quasispecies may promote viral evolution, however high depth of coverage is essential for the study of intra-host adaptation [
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The abundance of low-frequency variations is largely affected by the population size and the epidemic characteristics. For example, a neutral substitution in a region that represents a primer target for a molecular diagnostic assay can drift to fixation rather quickly in a rapidly spreading virus, jeopardizing the sensitivity of the assay [
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Here, we highlight three intra-host but also two fixed variants that are colocalized with primers or probes of real-time PCR diagnostics assays that are currently in use (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Since the binding affinity of these oligos to their genomic targets (Suppl.Table 2) is directly linked to the performance of the corresponding diagnostic assays, the community should pay extra attention in the evaluation of these potentially emerging variations and be alerted, in case redesigning of these oligos is needed.
