<p id="par0080">Intra-host variants were distributed across 7 out of the 10 protein-coding genes of the viral genome, namely ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and N. After normalising for the gene length (variants/kb-gene-length, “v/kbgl”), the density of the SNVs for each gene was estimated (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). The majority of the SNPs corresponded to missense changes (leading to amino-acid change) compared to synonymous changes (cumulatively 72 vs. 29 respectively, ratio 2.48:1) (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), while the average number of missense changes was marginally significantly higher compared to synonymous changes (233 vs. 8,0 respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.054). The average intra-host variant frequency did not differ significantly either between missense and synonymous polymorphisms (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &gt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.C), or between their hosting genes (pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests, p &gt; 0.05) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.D). We did not detect any small-scale insertions or deletions in the samples (Suppl. Table 1).
