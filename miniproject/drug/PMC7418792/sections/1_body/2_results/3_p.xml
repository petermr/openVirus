<p id="par0075">In all samples, the same 5 SNVs isolated with 98–100 % read concordance, thus in total divergence with the reference genome (MN975262.1), were excluded from downstream analysis. For sample SRR10903401 34 lower frequency SNVs were isolated in total. Of these, 33 were present with frequencies ranking between 2 and 15 %, while only one was present in 40 % of the intra-host viral population. The sequencing depth, which is also evaluated during the SNV calling by the LoFreq algorithm, ranked between 39x and 290x at the corresponding SNV positions. The sequencing depth of sample SRR10903402 at the polymorphic positions was higher (103x – 1137x), allowing the isolation of 55 SNVs with frequencies distributed between 0.9 % and 14 %. The depth over the polymorphic positions of sample SRR10971381 was between 159x – 1872x, allowing the isolation of 10 intra-host SNVs, with frequencies 1.1 %–6.8 % (
