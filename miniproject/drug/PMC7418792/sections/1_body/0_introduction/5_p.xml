<p id="par0035">The size of the ssRNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 29,891 nucleotides, it encodes 9860 amino acids and is characterized by nucleotide identity of ∼ 89 % with bat SARS-related (SL) CoV-ZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45. However, when compared to HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 showed genetic similarity of ∼ 80 % with human SARS-CoVs BJ01 2003 and Tor2 [

 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CoVs are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, characterized by a very large non-segmented genome (26–32 kb length), ready to be translated [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The genes arrangement on the SARS-CoV-2 genome is: 5′UTR -replicase (ORF1/ab) -Spike (S) -ORF3a -Envelope (E) -Membrane (M) -ORF6 -ORF7a -ORF8 -Nucleocapsid (N) ORF10 -3′UTR [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 encodes proteins that are very similar in length compared to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein however is longer compared to those encoded by SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [
