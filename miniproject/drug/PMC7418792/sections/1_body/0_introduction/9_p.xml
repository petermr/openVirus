<p id="par0055">Here, we explore intra-host genomic variants and low-frequency polymorphic quasispecies in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host genomic variability is critical for the development of novel drugs and vaccines, which are of urgent necessity, towards the containment of the pandemic.</p>
