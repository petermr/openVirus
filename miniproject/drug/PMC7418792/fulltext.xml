The outbreak was traced to a seafood wholesale market and human to human transmission was confirmed. The rapid spread and the death toll of the new epidemic warrants immediate intervention. The intra-host genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 plays a pivotal role in the development of effective antiviral agents and vaccines, as well as in the design of accurate diagnostics.</p><p>We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher- frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs (72/104) corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host as well as strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A / poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene.</p><p>Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19 epidemic</kwd><kwd>Intra-host variability</kwd><kwd>Quasispecies</kwd><kwd>Genomic rearrangements</kwd><kwd>Molecular diagnostics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0020">Coronaviruses (CoVs), considered to be the largest group of viruses, belong to the <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order, <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family and <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily, which is further subdivided into four genera, the alpha- and betacoronaviruses, which infect mammalian species and gamma- and deltacoronaviruses infecting mainly birds [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

In 2002, the beginning of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak took place [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

In 2012, the emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused an outbreak in Saudi Arabia, which affected both camels and humans, with a high mortality rate of approximately 343% among humans [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. MERS-CoV has zoonotic origins [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and was transmitted to humans through direct contact with dromedary camels or indirect contact with contaminated meat or milk [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="par0030">On December 31st &#x02013; 2019, a novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported from the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China, causing severe infection of the respiratory tract in humans, after the identification of a group of similar cases of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly to SARS, epidemiological links between the majority of COVID-19 cases and Huanan South China Seafood Market, a live-animal market, have been reported. A total of 76,775 confirmed cases of &#x0201c;Coronavirus Disease 2019&#x0201d; (COVID-19) were reported up to February 21st 2020, from which 2247 died and 18,855 recovered. Notably, 75,447 of the confirmed cases were reported in China [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="par0035">The size of the ssRNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 29,891 nucleotides, it encodes 9860 amino acids and is characterized by nucleotide identity of &#x0223c; 89 % with bat SARS-related (SL) CoV-ZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45. However, when compared to HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 showed genetic similarity of &#x0223c; 80 % with human SARS-CoVs BJ01 2003 and Tor2 [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and and 50 % with MERS-CoV [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Particularly for MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the genetic diversity and frequent recombination events, lead to periodical emergence of new viruses capable of infecting a wide range of hosts [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Intra-host variability in viral infections, emerges from genomic phenomena taking place during error-prone replication, ending up to multiple circulating quasispecies of low or higher frequency [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These variants, in combination with the genetic profile of the host, can potentially influence the natural history of the infection, the viral phenotype, but also the sensitivity of molecular and serological diagnostics assays [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the case of flu epidemics for example, de novo arising mutations and intra-host diversity not only forms intra-host evolution of Influenza A, but also greatly affects the pathogenesis of the virus [<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. Indeed, it is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants that emerge from inter- and intra-host evolution might be associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p id="par0045">Viruses have developed multiple adaptive strategies to counteract the host immunological response, which are subject to inter- and intra-host selection pressures; &#x0201c;Selfish&#x0201d; strategies confer a selective advantage in a particular quasispecies, impair the immune response inside the infected cell and evolve by intra-host selection, while neutral or &#x0201c;unselfish&#x0201d; defence strategies impair the immune response outside the infected cell and evolve by inter-host selection, preferentially in viruses with low mutation rates [<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is moderate and similar to other RNA viruses (0.00084 per site per year) [<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but still generally higher compared to DNA viruses [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, most of the suggested immune escape mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 involve intra-cellular interactions [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], thus expected to evolve by intra-host selective pressure. These observations highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 intra-host variability in the frame of viral evolution and host-pathogen interactions.</p><p id="par0050">Intra-host genomic variability also leads to antigenic variability, which is of higher importance, especially for pathogens that fail to elicit long-lasting immunity in their hosts, and remains a major contributor to the complexity of vaccine design [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines available for protection of general population from SARS- and MERS-CoV infections as there is no effective vaccine to induce robust cell mediated and humoral immune responses [<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p id="par0055">Here, we explore intra-host genomic variants and low-frequency polymorphic quasispecies in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

The intra- and inter- patient variability affects the compatibility of molecular diagnostics but also impairs the effectiveness of the vaccines and the serological assays by altering the antigenicity of the virus.</p><p id="par0100">All samples analysed in this study were probably infected by the same viral strain since they shared the same set of consensus SNVs. However, apart from 3 intra-host SNVs that were common between SRR10903401 and SRR10903402, there was no other overlap observed between the low frequency variants of each sample (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-B). This indicates that these variations have occurred in a rather random fashion and are not subject to selective pressures, which is also supported by the fact that the missense mutations were systematically more, compared to the synonymous mutations [<xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. On the other hand, missense substitutions are more common in loci involving pathogen resistance, indicating positive selection [<xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The analysed viral RNA might have originated from functional/packed virions, but also from unpacked viral genomes, unable to replicate and infect other host cells. Even if a viral genome is unable to replicate independently, its abundant presence in the pool of viral quasispecies implies some functionality regarding the intra-host evolution and adaptation. For example, defective viral genomes might affect infection dynamics such as viral persistence as well as the natural history of the infection [<xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At the same time, these variants may arise rapidly during an outbreak and can be used for tracking the transmission chains and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the epidemic [<xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>]. More studies based on genomic datasets accompanied by clinical metadata are needed, in order to accurately define associations between intra-host SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants, the progression and the clinical outcome of COVID19.</p><p id="par0105">SNVs and quasispecies observed at low frequency could represent viral variations of low impact on the functionality of the genome. Bal et al., suggest that development of quasispecies may promote viral evolution, however high depth of coverage is essential for the study of intra-host adaptation [<xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The abundance of low-frequency variations is largely affected by the population size and the epidemic characteristics. For example, a neutral substitution in a region that represents a primer target for a molecular diagnostic assay can drift to fixation rather quickly in a rapidly spreading virus, jeopardizing the sensitivity of the assay [<xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Here, we highlight three intra-host but also two fixed variants that are colocalized with primers or probes of real-time PCR diagnostics assays that are currently in use (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Since the binding affinity of these oligos to their genomic targets (Suppl.Table 2) is directly linked to the performance of the corresponding diagnostic assays, the community should pay extra attention in the evaluation of these potentially emerging variations and be alerted, in case redesigning of these oligos is needed.</p><p id="par0110">As it is well documented, recombination events lead to substantial changes in genetic diversity of RNA viruses [<xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In CoVs, discontinuous RNA synthesis is commonly observed, resulting in high frequencies of homologous recombination [<xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], which can be up to 25 % across the entire CoV genome [<xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. For pathogenic HCoVs genomic rearrangements are frequently reported during the course of epidemic outbreaks, such as HCoV-OC43 [<xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and HCoV-NL63 [<xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], SARS-CoV [<xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and MERS-CoV [<xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. We have isolated intra-host genomic rearrangements, located in poly-A and poly-U enriched palindrome regions across the SARS-CoV-2 genome (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). We conclude that these rearrangements do not represent artifacts derived from the NGS library preparation (e.g. PCR crosstalk artifacts), especially since all the supporting reads were not duplicated and, in some cases, differed in polymorphic positions (Suppl. Fig. 1).</p><p id="par0115">Recombination processes involving S gene particularly, have been reported for SARS- and SARS-like CoV but also for HCoV-OC43. In the case of sister species HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, recombination breakpoints are located near 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-end of the gene [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,65]. S is a trimeric protein, which is cleaved into two subunits, the globular N-terminal S1 and the C-terminal S2 [<xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Our analysis revealed that similarly to other genomic regions, the S1 subunit hosts many low-frequency SNVs, characterized by higher density compared to the rest of the S gene sequence (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>-E). The S2 subunit is highly conserved [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and contains two fusion peptides (FP, IFP) [<xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In S gene, the same rearrangement event has taken place in two samples analyzed in this study, located in nt24,000, which corresponds to the &#x0223c;200&#x0202f;nt linking region between FP and IFP (aa 812-813). This observation highlights a potential recombination hot-spot. Examining closely the secondary structure of the RNA genome around the breakpoints, we suggest a model where the palindromes 5&#x02032;-UGGUUUU-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-AAAACCAA-3&#x02032;, have served as donor-acceptor sequences during the recombination event, since they are both exposed in the single-stranded internal loops formed in a highly structured RNA pseudoknot (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>-C). The RB domain of the S protein has been tested as a potential immunogen as it contains neutralization epitopes which appear to have a role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It should be mentioned though that the S protein of SARS-CoV is the most divergent in all strains infecting humans [<xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], as in both C and N-terminal domains variations arise rapidly, allowing immunological escape [<xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Our findings support that apart from these variations, the N-terminal region also hosts a recombination hot-spot, which together with the rest of the observed rearrangements, indicates the genomic instability of SARS-CoV-2 over poly-A and poly-U regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="par0120">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="sec00005"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="par00005">
