Thus, the renovation of strategies for targeting viral surface glycoprotein is significant, because the viral protein is continuously changing its genetic makeup through antigenic variations and making it more potent. Therefore, these proteins are attractive targets for discovering and designing new classes of compounds to stop the progression of the disease. Alternative drugs with new either synthetic or natural bioactive agents are therefore urgently needed for disease mitigation and its related complications (Table
