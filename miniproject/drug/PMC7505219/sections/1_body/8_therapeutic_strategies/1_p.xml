<p id="Par62">Influenza is a major communicable pandemic disease with a global burden affecting all age groups, especially children and young people. Modern methods used to eradicate pandemic influenza infection include vaccines and antiviral agents such as adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine) and NA inhibitors (laninamivir, peramivir, oseltamivir, zanamivir). Which oral adamantanes block the M2 ion channel of influenza A virus (IAV) that balances the acidity of the golgi complex microenvironment resulting in the uncoating of the virus. NA inhibitors prohibit the release of virion progeny after budding from the host cell.</p>
