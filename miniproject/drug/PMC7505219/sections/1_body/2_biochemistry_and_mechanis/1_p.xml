<p id="Par28">Influenza A is a negative-sense ssRNA virus with a spherical or filamentous shape belonging to the orthomyxoviridae family. In addition to the point mutation in this virus, the genetic reassortment of RNA segments confers a unique ability to alter the host genome and the virulence factor. Swine flu viruses can be categorized on the basis of genetic/antigenic variations of glycoproteins on their surface, namely hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Both HA and NA play a significant role in the pathogenesis of viral disease and act as a significant target for vaccine design. Swine flu virus is multifaceted and involves the spread of different viruses among different animal classes.</p>
