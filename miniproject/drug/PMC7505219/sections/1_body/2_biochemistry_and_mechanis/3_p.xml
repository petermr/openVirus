<p id="Par30">Human respiratory cells and avian host cells differently express α-2, 3, and α-2, 6 sialic acid receptors, respectively, Swine can express both α-2, 3 as well as α-2, 6 sialic acid receptors. Due to the segmented viral genome, when two different types of Swine flu viruses infect the same host it can be interchanged, that generates a novel fusion called ‘reassortant'. Such ‘reassortant' is a key factor and potential source of 2009 influenza pandemic strains [
