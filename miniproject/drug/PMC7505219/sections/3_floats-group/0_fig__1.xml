  <p>The swine is a potential source for reassortment and mixing of influenza A viruses. The antigenic and genetic similarities between avian, human and swine influenza A viruses (IAV) make swine more susceptible to infected by both avian and human influenza strains. IAV from swine can also infect human. Avian and human Swine flu virus glycoprotein (HA) is preferentially binds to α-2, 3 and α-2, 6 SA receptors, which are independently expressed on the cells of respiratory track, whereas swine can express both types of SA receptors proving that swine act as a “mixing vessel” for avian and human influenza A viruses and that reassortant virus combination is responsible for the origin of novel pandemic influenza A (2009 H1N1) virus which effect in children age group. Children are highly susceptible to seasonal as well as influenza A infection and play key role in spreading “human to human” influenza infection. Re-entry of human IAV H1N1 to swine may give rise to a novel future influenza A strain which may further leads to pandemic/epidemic.
