 <p>Countries with ambitious national strategies to 
  <italic>crush the curve</italic> of their Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic trajectories include China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia. However, the United States and many hard-hit European countries, like Ireland, Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom, currently appear content to merely 
  <italic>flatten the curve</italic> of their epidemic trajectories so that transmission persists at rates their critical care services can cope with. Here I present a simple set of arithmetic modelling analyses that are accessible to non-specialists and explain why preferable 
  <italic>crush the curve</italic> strategies, to eliminate transmission within months, would require only a modest amount of additional containment effort relative to the tipping point targeted by 
  <italic>flatten the curve</italic> strategies, which allow epidemics to persist at supposedly steady, manageable levels for years, decades or even indefinitely.
