<p id="p0045">Many non-specialists are familiar with the explosive dynamics of exponential growth, reflected in the steep upward trajectories expected for 5% shortfalls relative to 
 <italic>flatten the curve</italic> containment targets (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, C, E and F). However, the equally important implications of non-linearities in exponential decay curves are less widely appreciated. Analogous to eating a cake in proportion to its remaining size, it takes a long time to get down to the last crumbs if one eats a third, and then a third of the remaining two thirds, and so on. By comparison, consuming two thirds the first time, and then two thirds of the remaining one third the second time, reduces the cake much faster. In fact, the remaining fraction of the hypothetical cake will be four times smaller (1/9 versus 4/9) after only removing two slices and the difference in relative size grows rapidly as these two trajectories proceed. The same simple arithmetic rules apply to epidemic containment, so the expected trajectories for 60% and 70% effective protective coverage in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E and F resemble those for our hypothetical cake. Correspondingly, these two modestly ambitious containment levels, which differ by only 10% in terms of effective protective coverage, need to be maintained for very different periods before the last cases are expected to occur. While lowering the incidence rate from 10,000 to only 1 case per week is expected to take 60 weeks at 60% effective protective coverage, the same near-elimination threshold would be reached after only 27 weeks at 70% effective protective coverage (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E and F). At 80% effective protective coverage, only 15 weeks are required to approach elimination, and while the “10 weeks to crush the curve” hypothesis (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Fineberg, 2020</xref>) appears questionably optimistic, it might nevertheless be plausible if 85% protective coverage could be achieved (
