The cause was identified as novel coronavirus (n-CoV) based on the laboratory findings in reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). In a short span of time, it has become a global phenomenon since the case of single pneumonia in Wuhan. Later, on 30 January 2020, WHO declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of global health Concern, stressing the need for worldwide action, international co-operation and solidarity and collaboration to control the outbreak? On 11 February 2020, WHO announced a name for the new coronavirus disease: COVID-19, later 11 March 2020, assessed that COVID-19can be characterized as a pandemic. The current areas known to be pandemic for COVID-19 outbreak globally have been summarized in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
, as on 10 August 2020. The journey status of rapidly progressing COVID-19 outbreak can be categorized into four stages globally. The first stage, is when cases of an infection are imported into a country from the other infectious country. The second stage of an outbreak is when there are cases of local transmission from infected patients. Community transmission is the third stage of an outbreak and fourth stage is when an infection becomes endemic with no clear endpoint. The world has seen three coronaviruses in last two decades, SARS, MERS, and now COVID-19.SARS-CoV was recognized at the end of February 2003 in Guangdong, China, and spread to many countries including European Union (EU), Southeast Asia, South Africa and North America [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Globally, as of 3:06&#x000a0;pm CEST, 10 August 2020, there have been 19,718,030 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 728,013 deaths, reported to WHO.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0035">Transmission was primarily person to person through infectious droplets that occurred during coughing or sneezing, through personal contact (shaking hands), or by touching contaminated surfaces. SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS coronaviruses are thought to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans from an intermediate host, civets and dromedary camels, respectively. For SARS-CoV-2, the zoonotic source and intermediate host is not confirmed yet and research is going on [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].The mean incubation period is about 5&#x000a0;days, ranging from 1 to 14&#x000a0;days and 95% of patients are likely to experience symptoms within 12.5&#x000a0;days of contact. However, asymptomatic carriers have been reported and the incubation period is 19&#x000a0;days, making it even more challenging to screen the infection [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">The care advised is to give fluid management, oxygen supportive as patients condition [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and antibiotic in secondary infection if any reported [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

There is only one way the world can exit this pandemic- and that is through science. We need diagnostic detection kit to detect and prevent the spread of the virus, vaccines for long-term protection, treatments to save lives in the shorter-term and social science to understand the behavioral and societal implications. It's critical that the global research effort is rapid, robust and is conducted at scale and co-ordinated across multiple countries. The WHO solidarity trial will provide this by testing existing and new drug molecules to treat COVID-19 and ensure equitable access to any drugs that prove effective. Global powers must now step-up to ensure the WHO has all the support needed [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0045">A vast number of promising anti-viral treatments are currently under investigation to aid in the development of COVID-19 drug delivery. The current review focuses on the possible particulate delivery approaches and the research agenda to combat COVID-19.

In which, M determines the shape of the viral envelope and forms the central organizer of n-CoV assembly. Protein E interacts with M protein to form the viral envelope. The crown like appearance of the n-CoV is due to the large protrusions of S protein from the virus envelope.

However, a genomic study has proven that the virus was introduced from another source, yet unknown location into the market where it spread more rapidly, although human-to-human transmission is also reported previously. Person-to-person transmission is thought to occur through near contacts mainly through respiratory droplets produced during coughing or sneezing by an infected person. Fomites may be a large source of transmission, as SARS-CoV has been found to persist on surfaces up to 96&#x000a0;h [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and other coronaviruses for up to 9&#x000a0;days [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="p0080">The basic reproductive number (R0) measures the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a fully susceptible population.

Because R0represents an average value it is also important to consider the role of super spreaders, who may be hugely responsible for outbreaks within large clusters but who would not largely influence the value of R0 [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. R0 remains unstable during the initial stages of pandemic due to short onset time and insufficient data availability.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>6</label><title>Prevention of COVID-19</title><p id="p0085">Prevention is always better than cure to combat of any infectious disease.

Washing hands frequently with water and soap, or clean them with alcohol-based sanitizers, maintaining at least 1&#x000a0;m distance, covering mouth-nose during coughing or sneezing. Practice physical distancing devoid unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of peoples [<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For early detection of the virus, public awareness should be created regarding the unusual symptoms like chronic cough or shortness of breath. Quarantine of suspected people, isolation of the infected people and their close contacts can be the crucial step in eradication of the virus.</p><p id="p0090">Mitigating social gatherings, temporary school closure, home isolation, close monitoring of symptomatic individual, provision of life supports (e.g. oxygen supply, mechanical ventilator), personal hand hygiene, and wearing personal protective equipment such as facemask should also been forced by the government to prevent the further transmission of virus [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>7</label><title>Pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="p0095">Specific replication mechanism is still unclear for SARS-CoV-2. It had been reported that replication of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other viruses of the coronavirus family, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It may be two step reaction of SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter in the body to spread the infection. Firstly, binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) or CD-147or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]or transmembrane protease serine 2(TMPRSS2) and the second is cleavage of the spike protein by the TMPRSS2 [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which exposes the fusion peptide, allowing it to survive in low-pH endosomes [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p id="p0100">ACE-2 receptors have been found as the main cellular receptor for binding with the receptor-binding domain of virus spikes and responsible receptors for human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. ACE-2 protein is abundantly found in alveolar epithelial cells of lungs and enterocytes of small intestine. It was found that the virus primary binds to the target site on lung epithelial cells. Wang et al also found that ACE-2 was abundantly expressed in gallbladder, liver, kidney, testes, gastrointestinal tract, and bladder suggesting that these organs may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may help to understand the routes of infection and disease manifestations [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily exhibit lesions in the lungs, despite the ACE-2 receptor being widely distributed in various organs of the human body, so this connection needs to be investigated further.</p><p id="p0105">In addition, ACE-2 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells, which raises the question of whether the virus can cause damage to vascular endothelial cells or impact glomerular function. Xu et al. recently found that it has been seen rare kidney damage in COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang [<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is not clear yet that the SARS-CoV-2binds with ACE-receptors only or other receptors also. The organs withACE-2positive cells match the organs involved with the disease, as reported in clinical studies, which raises the question of whether novel coronavirus infection causes more deaths by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or respiratory failure [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p id="p0110">SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds with ACE-2 receptor and it is a crucial step for the virus entry in to host cells. Homotrimers (S1 and S2) of S proteins assists the attachment to the host receptors. The S2 subunit of SARS-Cov-2 is highly conserved and serves as a target for antiviral therapeutics. Several therapeutics approaches of virus-receptor binding affinity are under investigation. Systematic detection of &#x003b2;-CoV receptors showed that human cells expressing ACE-2 was enhanced the detection of entry of SARS-CoV-2 but human Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) or APN (Aminopeptidase N) had not enhanced entry of SARS-CoV-2. While, another study showed that S protein of SARS-CoV2 and ACE-2 binding efficiency is 10- to 20- fold higher than that of SARS-CoV. It is evidenced by Cryo-TEM Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike in the prefusion conformation [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p id="p0115">After entry of virus in to the cell, IL-6 is produced by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and tissues. Levels of tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-8, IL-12, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1A (MIP1A)and interferon-gamma inducible protein (IP10) are also increased in SARS CoV-2 infected patients as shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> [<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The incidence of ARDS, shock, secondary infection, acute kidney injury and heart was significantly higher in patients with intensive care unit (ICU) than in non-ICU patients. The main proportion of IL-6 above normal was significantly higher than that in the patients. Infection with MERS coronavirus can induce increased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor 616 necrosis factor &#x003b1;, IL15, and IL17, and interferon-&#x003b3;,). The severe COVID-19 cases may benefit from IL-6 pathway inhibition given the associated Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and sHLH (Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) like serum cytokine elevations, which may be a target of the treatment of COVID-19 infected patients [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Excessive tissue damage is occurred owing to the excessive release of cytokines. In some cases, a reaction takes place which is labeled as &#x02018;cytokine storm&#x02019;.

Post COVID-19 involves complications, lessons learned, immunity, financial loss and preparedness. The only complication of COVID-19 is a type of pneumonia called 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) in conjunction to ARDS, RNAaemia, acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection associated with other types of corona virus [<xref rid="bb0710" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>].</p><p id="p0400">Sekowski et al reported the high chances of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in COVID-19 survivors based on previous research on PTSD in epidemic survivors (e.g. SARS)[<xref rid="bb0715" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. PTSD is a serious mental disorder that negatively affects functioning and social life by reliving the traumatic event, emotional numbness and increased arousal. Preliminary report by Bo et al indicated that almost all clinically stable patients with COVID-19 in China experienced significant severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms [<xref rid="bb0720" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Both the studies suggest to regularly screen for PTSD and pay attention on individuals at increased risk of complications, appropriate crisis psychological interventions and long-term follow up assessments should be started immediately for COVID-19 survivors. The issue of negative detrimental impact of significant posttraumatic stress prevalence of PTSD in individuals post COVID-19 remains a matter of future research as symptoms may develop up to 6&#x000a0;months after the traumatic event [<xref rid="bb0715" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>].</p><p id="p0405">Immunity remains the cornerstone for post COVID&#x02212;19 survival. The strength and duration of immune response in COVID&#x02212;19 survivors remain as the major knowledge gap. There is no evidence at this point that people can't be reinfected with the virus and the development of an antibody response will be protective from secondary infection, according to WHO. Some countries suggested detection of antibodies to COVID&#x02212;19, could serve as the basis for an &#x02018;immunity passport&#x02019; or certificate of immunity assuming that they are protected against re-infection. But WHO said that issuing such certificate increases the severity of the disease. HERD immunity would be played an important role to address the devastating COVID-19, which is an indirect protection conferred to the susceptible ones by immune individuals against a specific pathogenic infestation in a given population [<xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. It is possible only through vaccination. Vaccine approval may take up to a decade or more to win approval based on their ability to prevent disease in population. Typically, HERD immunity isn't achieved in a short time like year or two and would take several years to confer sufficient &#x02018;HERD immunity&#x02019; to fight COVID-19 [<xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>].</p><p id="p0410">The lessons from unprecedented COVID&#x02212;19 teach one about the importance of readiness, preparedness and response actions to combat sudden epidemics globally. In the battle of COVID-19 it is very crucial to maintain close watch of recovered patients, understand the long-term complications associated the risk of relapse and post discharge surveillance of COVID-19 survivors.

This study presents the current status of the deadly infectious COVID-19 with special emphasis on the research agenda to fighting against COVID-19.The current review focuses on the possible particulate delivery approaches and the research agenda to combat COVID-19.The research agenda discussed in this context covers all the areas such as ground work, epidemiology, immunology, viral therapeutics and vaccine. The challenges, knowledge gaps and the research efforts are discussed in the specified areas. The major goals to combat COVID-19 are to identify, diagnose, treat and stop the transmission of virus due to its sudden spill over globally. Future perspective should focus on repurposing of antiviral drugs, development of animal models, in-vitro in-vivo studies to aid the screening of antiviral drugs, prevent transmission of disease, and develop vaccine as early as possible.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Author declaration template</title><p id="p0420">We wish to draw the attention of the Editor to the following facts which may be considered as potential conflicts of interest and to significant financial contributions to this work.</p><p id="p0425">[OR]</p><p id="p0430">We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.</p><p id="p0435">We confirm that the manuscript has been read and approved by all named authors and that there are no other persons who satisfied the criteria for authorship but are not listed.
