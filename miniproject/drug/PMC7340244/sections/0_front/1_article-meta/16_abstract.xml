 <p>Although the etiology of Kawasaki disease (KD) remains elusive, the available evidence indicates that the primum movens may be a dysregulated immune response to various microbial agents, leading to cytokine cascade and endothelial cell activation in patients with KD. Documented infections by different viruses in many individual cases have been largely reported and are discussed herein, but attempts to demonstrate their causative role in the distinctive KD scenario and KD epidemiological features have been disappointing. To date, no definite link has been irrefutably found between a single infection and KD.</p>
