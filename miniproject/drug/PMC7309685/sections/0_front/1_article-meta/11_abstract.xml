 <p id="Par1">This is an introduction to the topical collection 
  <italic>Microbes, Networks, Knowledge: Disease Ecology in the twentieth Century,</italic> based on a workshop held at Queen Mary, University London on July 6–7 2016. More than twenty years ago, historian of science and medicine Andrew Mendelsohn asked, “Where did the modern, ecological understanding of epidemic disease come from?” Moving beyond Mendelsohn’s answer, this collection of new essays considers the global history of disease ecology in the past century and shows how epidemics and pandemics have made “microbes complex”.
