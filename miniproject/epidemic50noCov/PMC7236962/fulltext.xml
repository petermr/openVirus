In both, these infections are characterized by high viremia, rash, fever, encephalitis and death. VEEV encephalitis is similar, clinically, to other arboviral diseases, such as dengue, Zika or chikungunya. Most of the alphaviruses are transmitted between vertebrates and mosquitoes. They are able to replicate in a wide number of hosts, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibian and arthropods. The VEEV has enzootic and epizootic transmission cycles. At the enzootic one, enzootic strains (subtype I, serotypes D&#x02013;F and serotypes II&#x02013;VI) are continuously circulating between mosquitoes and wild rodents in tropical forests and mangroves of the Americas. The main reseroivrs are wild rodent species of the subfamily <italic>Sigmodontinae</italic>. However, bats can be also accidental reservoirs of VEEV. In this article, we reviewed the main features, epidemiology, clinical aspects and the current perspectives of the VEEV.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Arbovirus</kwd><kwd>Equine</kwd><kwd>Chiroptera</kwd><kwd>Alphavirus</kwd><kwd>Zoonoses</kwd><kwd>Americas</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Universidad de Cordoba</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). Mosquito vectors transmit the virus, mainly affects Equidae, humans, and wild animals. The enzootic cycle of VEEV is complex and infects many different species of mammals and mosquitoes. Some of the enzootic viral species within the Alphavirus genus are known as VEEV, Mosso das Pedras virus, Everglades virus, Mucambo virus, Tonate virus, Pixuna virus, Cabassou virus, and R&#x000ed;o Negro virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The spread of VEEV varies in speed and intensity according to the viral subtype and the densities of mosquito populations, and the transmission is produced by the vector that feeds on an infected animal and subsequently infects a new host. The epizootic subtypes of VEEV are amplified in Equidae, where they spread rapidly and can be highly pathogenic in horses, donkeys, and mules. The disease in horses is characterized by fever, loss of appetite, and disorders of the central nervous system, such as muscle deterioration, blindness, and seizures. In humans, early symptoms of VEEV infection include flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, malaise, severe headache, myalgia in the legs and lower back, tachycardia, and in some cases, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If there are neurological signs, they can include seizures, drowsiness, confusion, and photophobia. Children are more likely to suffer permanent neurological damage. After 4 to 6&#x000a0;days of acute illness, the patient may feel weak for several weeks. Lethal cases manifest with diffuse congestion and edema in the brain, gastrointestinal tract, and pulmonary hemorrhage and sometimes triggers meningoencephalitis.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Biological characteristics of VEEV</title><p id="Par4">The International Virus Taxonomy Committee classified the virus into the Togaviridae family, genus Alphavirus, and according to the Baltimore classification: Group IV (+) ssRNA (REF). The VEEV has single-stranded RNA approximately 70&#x000a0;nm in diameter, with icosahedral symmetry. The 5&#x02032; end of the genome encodes four non-structural proteins, nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4, and the 3&#x02032; end is responsible for three structural proteins, the capsid and the envelope proteins E1 and E2. Non-structural proteins participate in the replication of the viral genome involved in functions of the cytoplasm of the host.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>VEEV and other similar equine encephalitis in America</title><p id="Par5">In addition to VEEV, Eastern equine encephalitis (EEEV), Western (WEEV) are frequent viral infections in the Americas (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which also belong to the genus Alphavirus (<italic>Togaviridae</italic>). In humans, WEEV, EEEV viruses, like VEEV, cause symptoms ranging from mild febrile illness to severe encephalitis that can lead to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result of vaccination, in some countries such as the United States, there are no longer periodically severe epidemics of EEEV and WEEV encephalitis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, sporadic cases and small outbreaks are observed.

Between 1930 and 1950, WEEV produced widespread outbreaks that covered western North America, extending northward into Saskatchewan, Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the epizootic reached the east side of the Canadian Rockies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The incidence of WEEV has decreased over the past four decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the last human case in North America occurred in 1994, and the virus has not been detected in mosquito pools since 2008. The WEEV was isolated in Argentina in 2009. Subsequently, an outbreak in Uruguay resulted in a fatal human case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">With respect, the North American variant of the EEEV is found in Eastern Canada, and in all states east of the Mississippi, it has also been isolated in Arkansas, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Texas. The South American variant is found in areas of Central and South America and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The numerous strains of the EEEV can be grouped into two variants. The variant found in North America is more pathogenic than the variant of Central and South America. Most of the Caribbean strains belong to the North American EEEV group, but the South American variant can also be found (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Due to genetic divergence and significant differences in ecology and pathogenesis, the isolations of South America from EEEV were recently classified as a distinct species that was called Madariaga virus (MADV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, unlike the EEEV of North America, the MADV, formerly known as equine encephalitis of the South American East, was not associated with outbreaks in humans before 2010 when the first outbreak of the MADV was reported in the Darien region of Panama. Before the Dari&#x000e9;n outbreak, in South America, there were only three reported cases of EEEV in humans in Brazil and Trinidad. Unlike the epidemiological profile in South America, in North America, eight human cases of neuroinvasive EEEV disease have been reported on average between 2004 and 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. From the epidemiological perspective, it is interesting to observe that when comparing the epidemics and epizootics of MADV and VEEV, the latter are explosive and involve equine amplification, which has resulted in 100,000 cases or more in humans and thousands of equine deaths in Latin America.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Epidemiology of Venezuelan equine encephalitis</title><p id="Par9">The clinical manifestation of the disease was described as a &#x0201c;mad plague&#x0201d; in South America in the 1920s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

The virus is widely distributed throughout the Americas, and outbreaks have been reported in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador, Panama, Mexico and the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The VEEV has enzootic and epizootic serotypes.

Outbreaks have been documented for decades in countries with enzootic circulation. The implementation of surveillance systems has allowed the detection of additional human cases in countries and areas with the previously unknown activity of VEEV. Clinically, VEEV is indistinguishable from dengue and other arbovirus diseases, and confirmatory diagnosis requires specialized laboratory tests that are difficult to implement in regions with limited resources. Therefore, an endemic disease in developing countries remains mostly unknown.

Horses are susceptible to the virus, and the lethality rate for horses is between 20 and 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. VEEV is neurotropic and neuroinvasive, the virus replicates in lymphoid tissue and the brain, causing an acute viral infection that is typically resolved by the innate and adaptive response. However, neurological symptoms occur in 14% of human infections, and approximately 1% result in lethal encephalitis.</p><p id="Par12">Humans have a minor role in the epidemiology of epizootic cycles because the horses have a greater area exposed to mosquitoes. For this reason, they are considered as natural amplifiers of the disease, capable of generating large viremia and infecting new vectors, which can transmit the disease.

The viremia process is produced in the salivary glands, and then, the viruses&#x02019; passage to new reservoirs during the feeding of the vector. The mosquito saliva is deposited in the extravascular space of the affected vertebrae, then by the interaction of the E2 protein and receptors on the surface of the host cell, the viruses enter the cell by endocytosis and are taken to endosomes. The low pH at endosomes releases components of the virus, they move to the cytoplasm through pores in the endosome. The nucleocapsid is disassembled in the cytoplasm, leading to virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Many species of mosquitoes can transmit this virus because the high epidemic power allows it to infect and produce many cases in humans and animals in a short time. Among the species capable of transmitting VEEV are Culex (Melaconion), Aedes, Mansonia, Psorophora, Haemagogus, Sabethes, Deinocerites, and Anopheles. It is also possible that some classes of Diptera may transmit the virus.</p><p id="Par19">The <italic>Culex</italic> species is the one that maintains the transmission of enzootic viruses in nature, while a wide range of mosquitoes transmits epizootic viruses. The disease is almost clinically indistinguishable from other viral diseases such as dengue or influenza, and in reality, several epidemics of Venezuelan equine encephalitis have been diagnosed in their initial stages as dengue. Usually, the disease begins suddenly with severe headache, fever, chills, myalgia, retro-ocular pain, nausea, and vomiting. Infections in 80% are mild, and last only 3 to 5&#x000a0;days. In many cases, the febrile course is diphasic, after a few days of fever there may be signs that affect the central nervous system, ranging from drowsiness to encephalitis with disorientation, seizures, coma, and death paralysis. The involvement of the central nervous system is more frequent in children; it is estimated that about 5% of those under 15 who become infected with VEEV can develop neurological conditions. However, in children under 5&#x000a0;years, this figure can be increased to 35%. In severe cases, the proportion of lethality can be as high as 10%, in many cases, there may be sequelae such as mental incapacity, epilepsy, learning difficulties, hydrocephalus, personality changes, and paralysis. A study conducted by London et al. in-Rhesus monkeys showed that VEEV infection is a risk to the fetus, capable of causing congenital disabilities, fetal death, and abortion. VEEV has a severe teratogenic effect on the central nervous system of primates. Viral titers obtained from the brain, uterus, and other organs indicated that fetal infection and virus replication occurred. Congenital microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and cataracts in 67% of the animals were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">In pregnant women who have suffered VEEV infection, an increase in abortions and births of children with congenital malformations has been found, especially at the level of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The mechanism by which VEEV invades the central nervous system is not completely clear. In hamsters, it has been documented that the invasion occurs through olfactory neurons when the inoculation is nasal or by aerosols. However, this mechanism has also been observed after peripheral inoculation. Natural immunity to the disease is mediated by the presence of antibodies against the E2 glycoprotein. These antibodies are protective and persist throughout life. One of the factors that seem to be more critical within the virulence of the enzootic and epizootic strains of VEEV is the presence of early elimination of the infecting virions. In less virulent strains, this elimination occurs in less than 30&#x000a0;min in experimentally infected animals, while more virulent strains take much longer to be removed. Other essential characteristics of less virulent strains are that they induce minor viremias, and the titers found in lymphoid organs are smaller than those of more virulent strains. Currently, there are no vaccines for VEEV in humans; however, two vaccines are used under the research status of new drugs to protect laboratory personnel. The live attenuated TC-83 strain vaccine protects animals from subcutaneous and aerosol exposure, and 82% of humans develop immunity after vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Epizootics and epidemics</title><p id="Par21">The first well-documented outbreak involving equines occurred in Valle del Cauca, Colombia, in 1935 and dispersed to Venezuela the following year.

Approximately 13% (250/2000) of the inhabitants had a febrile illness compatible with VEEV; two died but could not Isolate the virus during the outbreak. In Colombia, during 2011, there were four foci of encephalitis in horses, three foci of Venezuelan equine encephalitis in the departments of C&#x000f3;rdoba and Magdalena, and a focus of eastern equine encephalitis in the department of Casanare (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Additionally, there was a case of VEEV confirmed by seroconversion in a minor in the municipality of Barrancabermeja, bordering Venezuela. Venezuelan equine encephalitis has an epidemiological behavior of persistence with apparent epidemiological silences. However, this is because, in countries endemic to flaviviruses, the first diagnostic impression is Dengue and recently Zika. Despite having had an epidemic peak of 40,000 cases by 1995, over time, the number of human cases has significantly decreased, and cases in animals have sporadically occurred. In Colombia, in the last 17&#x000a0;years, there has been a significant reduction in the foci of Venezuelan equine encephalitis. However, in 2010, there was an increase attributable to risk factors such as humid tropical areas, with vector proliferation, flooding of the Magdalena, San Jorge and Sin&#x000fa; rivers, and high rainfall of 800&#x02013;1200&#x000a0;mm. Associated with this, Equidae used as working animals on farms are not vaccinated, which allows viral amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Novel strategies for prevention and control</title><p id="Par27">Vector control is the foremost approach accessible for controlling several VBDs, including VEEV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. For other diseases are vaccines available for human use, such as is the case of yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. But for VEEV only vaccines for animals are available. Then, vector control is currently the only method available to protect human people. Vector control seeks to limit the transmission of pathogens by reducing or eliminating human contact with the vectors. A broad range of vector control tools exists, which can be broadly classified into chemical- and not&#x02013;chemical-based tools. Means pursuing immature vectors can act by destroying the immature stages (e.g., chemical or biological larvicides and predator species) or by removing viable aquatic habitats (e.g., habitat modification or manipulation). Means oriented to the adult vectors function by destroying the vector (e.g., indoor residual spraying [IRS], space spraying) and reducing vector contact (blood-feeding success) with human and animal reservoir hosts (e.g., topical repellents, house screening, insecticide-treated bed nets [ITNs], insecticide-treated dog collars). There are also several novel vector control tools under development, e.g., genetic manipulation of mosquitoes, a bacterial infection of vectors (e.g., Wolbachia), and insecticide-treated eave tubes. The most essential novel strategies, still to be appropriately implemented in VEEV, are gene drive, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, spatial repellents, and eave tubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Gene drive is an approach of genetic alteration that can be used to spread favorable traits through interbreeding populations of malaria mosquitoes, still to be proved on <italic>Culex</italic>. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a bacteria genus that naturally infect certain insect species, not typically found in mosquitoes. That has not yet assessed in the VEEV vectors, although effectively on <italic>Aedes</italic>. Spatial repellents are compounds that prevent vectors from entering spaces occupied by a potential human host to reduce encounters between the vector and the host. Eave tubes are small plastic tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic netting that are inserted into the house wall, below the roof. Mosquitoes are lured to the house by host outdoors emanating through the eave tubes and are killed after contacting the insecticide-treated netting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">In conclusion, Venezuelan equine encephalitis is a persistent zoonosis in Latin America through long periods of apparent epidemiological silence. Rodents can be their main reservoirs; however, there are no robust eco-epidemiological studies that demonstrate their role in zoonosis. Bats could have a potential role as dispersing hosts for this virus. Equine surveillance is useful as a predictive indicator or sentinel to prevent cases in humans.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CGT, SM conceived the review, search articles, analyzed and interpreted findings.
