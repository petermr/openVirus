<p>The Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) of the Government of Nepal (GoN) has developed an Early Warning and Reporting System (EWARS) to warn about potential outbreaks of the disease. Signatures of the potential emergence of the current epidemic were detected about half a year ago on the first week of May 2019 with sporadic cases in the country [

Although government authorities were informed early about a potential epidemic outbreak, they failed to quickly implement counterstrategies including early warning to the public which led to an unusually long response time once the actual outbreak occured. Generally, the temporal progress of an dengue epidemic in Nepal intensifies over several months. Outbreaks following the monsoon season co-occur with high humidity and ambient temperatures which favour the replication, maturation, and transmission of dengue vectors [

Post-monsoon period with high rainfall and heavy flooding resulting conducive conditions for vector breeding with increased disease transmission efficiency is linked with higher morbidity and mortality unless stringent prevention and control measures are enforced. Though a rapid increase in dengue cases have been observed since 2010, and spatial and temporal disease projections are known, the government of Nepal is failing to respond in a timely manner with appropriate management strategies.
