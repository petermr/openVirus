 <p>ZIKA, caused by mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV), is typically asymptomatic or with mild fever, and the occurrence of ZIKV infections are reported around the world. However, limited ZIKV epidemiological investigation was performed and no ZIKV infection cases were ever reported in China. Here, we observed that Zika virus also distributes in China. This work not only suggests ZIKV as a potential threat to public health in China but also expands our knowledge of ZIKV epidemic regions in East and Southeast Asia. Therefore, government officials, physicians and public health workers in China need to pay attention to ZIKV infection cases.</p>
