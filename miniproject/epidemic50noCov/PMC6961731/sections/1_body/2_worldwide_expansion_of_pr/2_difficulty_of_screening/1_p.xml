<p>The difficulties of screening pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa are major. They are multifactorial (insufficient medical or paramedical time to propose, realize, and perform the tests, availability of facilities, maintenance of devices, etc.) leading to a “cascade of missed opportunity,” with a considerable loss of efficiency of programs in many locations (

Beyond these organizational difficulties, screening is also difficult due to the sometimes-catastrophic family and social consequences of the stigmatization of women known to be infected with HIV. However, the situation is improving, and there has been a gradual increase in the number of women screened worldwide (
 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(a</xref>)), estimated by the WHO to be more than 65% in 2014, but with large regional disparities. It is possible that such progression is stalling and that the remaining 35% will be more difficult to reach: women who have no contact with a health structure during pregnancy, a high risk of stigma surrounding HIV, or the severe material deprivation of some rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa [
