<p>The first success observed in Europe and North America in 1994 did not allow for the nihilism typical of highly endemic countries with often limited resources [

 <italic>postpartum</italic> administration to children. This prophylaxis, although simplified to the extreme, reduced the risk of transmission by half but induced a particularly high rate of resistance in infected mothers and children. Remarkably, simplification of the preventive strategies was then abandoned, and they followed the European and North American recommendations [
