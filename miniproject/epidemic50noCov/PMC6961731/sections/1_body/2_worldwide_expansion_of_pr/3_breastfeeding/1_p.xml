<p>The risk of post-natal transmission of HIV can ruin the effectiveness of 
 <italic>pre</italic>- and 
 <italic>peripartum</italic> prophylaxis. The first approach to address this issue was to try and shake up current dogma and consider artificial-feeding programs, despite their high cost, potential nutritional risks, and the risk of intestinal foodborne infection. The inability to apply this strategy at the national level became rapidly apparent [
 <xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>]. Again, it was antiretrovirals that provided the solution by allowing “safe” breastfeeding. Two strategies are possible: treatment of the mother, rendering viral replication undetectable in milk, or treatment of the child, following the “post-exposure prophylaxis” approach. Remarkably, the preventive efficacy of these two approaches is similar, reducing the risk of transmission through breastfeeding to less than 1–2%, including during prolonged breastfeeding [

Protection is therefore not immediately effective, unlike “post-exposure prophylaxis,” which is effective from the first day of its administration to the child. Treatment given simultaneously to the child and the mother is certainly needed in this specific situation. Above all, maternal treatment – beyond the protection it provides to the child – provides long-term maternal health benefits, and this option (called B + in WHO programs) is now implemented in all countries in which breastfeeding is necessary [
 <xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>]. Pregnancy thus appears to be a gateway to the long-term treatment of the mother and guarantor of her own health and that of her children. The great success of “safe breastfeeding” with antiretrovirals started a controversy about the end of restricting breastfeeding in high-income countries. However, although extremely reduced, zero risk has never been observed with safe breastfeeding, contrary to artificial feeding. Some authors have highlighted the specific risk of infection of the child with intracellular virus, despite the control of viral replication, as being able to cause cases of contamination of children while viral replication in milk was undetectable [
