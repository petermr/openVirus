<p>Many cohorts in both low- and high-resource countries have shown an elevated incidence of bacterial infection in children born to HIV-positive mothers [
 <xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref>]. This risk mainly concerns encapsulated bacteria (
 <italic>Hemophilus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pneumococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, etc.). A passive deficit in transplacental immunoglobulin has been well demonstrated. It mainly concerns children of women with severe immunodeficiency and lasts a few months, until the production of immunoglobulins by the child is established [
 <xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref>]. This phenomenon is expected to diminish as the immunological health status of the mothers improves with the use of antiretrovirals. A certain number of immune abnormalities intrinsic to the child have also been described in studies of limited numbers of participants, with sometimes contradictory results, making it impossible to affirm their veracity [
 <xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. Specific humoral responses after vaccination are normal, testifying to an efficient collaboration between T and B lymphocytes and the integrity of the immune system of HIV exposed-uninfected children [
 <xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref>]. Regardless of the cause, the increased risk of infections has led to an enhanced vaccination program in exposed, uninfected children.
