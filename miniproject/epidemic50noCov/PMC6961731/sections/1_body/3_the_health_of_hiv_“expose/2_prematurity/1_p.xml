<p>Premature births to HIV-infected mothers were already recognized before the era of antiretrovirals, even in the absence of the usual risk factors for prematurity. The specific mechanisms associated with maternal HIV infection are not known. The severity of the immune deficiency increases such risk, but there is still a risk for women without significant immunodeficiency. It is possible that antiretrovirals in the class of protease inhibitors themselves induce paradoxical prematurity, despite improving maternal health, but the data are discordant [
