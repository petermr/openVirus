<p>The malformation rate observed in children born to HIV-positive mothers is broadly similar to that observed in the general population [
 <xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>]. Molecule-by-molecule analyses have identified some risk but with contradictory results depending on the study, such as those that followed the alert on efavirenz-related neural tube-closure abnormalities [
 <xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>]. A low risk of cardiac malformation – most often of minimal severity – has been observed after exposure to zidovudine [
 <xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>]. More recently, an alert has suggested possible neural-tube toxicity of dolutegravir, pending further analysis [
 <xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. This information would urge caution in the large-scale use of this new molecule which has, however, much potential interest in terms of efficiency, genetic barriers to resistance, and cost.
