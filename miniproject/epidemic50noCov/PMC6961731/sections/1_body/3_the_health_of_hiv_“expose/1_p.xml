<p>More than one million children are born to HIV-infected mothers each year around the world. Even in the absence of any intervention, most children born to mothers infected with HIV are free of the infection. Now, almost all such children are HIV free due to the use of antiretrovirals. Although the health of most of these children is not of concern, a fine assessment is nonetheless necessary due to the low frequency of alerts and the number of children involved [
 <xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref>]. The health of these children is likely influenced by three factors, without it being easy to distinguish their respective roles (
 <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). (1) The environment and maternal lifestyle can play an important role. Often linked to HIV infection, social vulnerability and poverty can lead to prematurity, fetal hypotrophy, and, in the post-natal period, undernutrition, increased risk of infections, and psychological consequences [
 <xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>]. Maternal substance abuse, leading to HIV infection, can also have a serious impact on the child’s health, as already well established [
 <xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>]. (2) The mother’s disease can potentially disrupt the progress of pregnancy, resulting in an increased risk of transmission of co-infections that sometimes accompany HIV infection (syphilis, 
 <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, 
 <italic>N. gonorrhea</italic>, HBV, and HCV). It can also indirectly induce immune disturbances in children [
 <xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>]. (3) Finally, antiretrovirals can potentially disrupt the course of pregnancy, induce embryonic malformations, or lead to organ toxicity, similar to that observed in adults and older children. Such toxicity may or may not be reversible and may be detectable from birth or later during the life of the child [
