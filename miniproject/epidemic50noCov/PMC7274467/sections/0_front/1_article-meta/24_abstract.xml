 <p>Rabid dogs constitute the main source of rabies transmission to humans, therefore understanding disease dynamics in dogs is essential to reduce human risk. Mathematical models are invaluable in exploring intervention scenarios where field experiments can be expensive or impractical. We developed a data-driven model to identify the mechanisms for rabies dispersal, accounting for dogs’ spatial fragmentation, human-mediated movements, and empirically estimated fluctuations of the incubation period in dogs. Applied to Central African Republic, our model indicates that continuous re-introductions of rabid dogs via human-mediated movements are critical in sustaining the disease in the country. Long-range travel restrictions can be very effective in aiding rabies control. Our approach can be extended to other geographical settings.</p>
