  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>To establish strategic priorities for the German national public health institute (RKI) and guide the institute's mid-term strategic decisions, we prioritized infectious pathogens in accordance with their importance for national surveillance and epidemiological research.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>We used the Delphi process with internal (RKI) and external experts and a metric-consensus approach to score pathogens according to ten three-tiered criteria. Additional experts were invited to weight each criterion, leading to the calculation of a median weight by which each score was multiplied. We ranked the pathogens according to the total weighted score and divided them into four priority groups.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>127 pathogens were scored. Eighty-six experts participated in the weighting; “Case fatality rate” was rated as the most important criterion. Twenty-six pathogens were ranked in the highest priority group; among those were pathogens with internationally recognised importance (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus, 
   <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, Influenza virus, Hepatitis C virus, 
   <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic>), pathogens frequently causing large outbreaks (e.g., 
   <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp.), and nosocomial pathogens associated with antimicrobial resistance. Other pathogens in the highest priority group included 
   <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Varicella zoster virus and 
   <italic>Hantavirus</italic>.
  </p>

  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p>While several pathogens from the highest priority group already have a high profile in national and international health policy documents, high scores for other pathogens (e.g., 
   <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, Respiratory syncytial virus or Hantavirus) indicate a possible under-recognised importance within the current German public health framework. A process to strengthen respective surveillance systems and research has been started. The prioritization methodology has worked well; its modular structure makes it potentially useful for other settings.
