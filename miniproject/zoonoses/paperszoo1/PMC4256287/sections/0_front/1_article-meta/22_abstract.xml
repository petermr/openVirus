 <p>
  <italic>Chlamydophila psittaci</italic> is a bacterial pathogen which can cause avian chlamydiosis and human psittacosis. Although 
  <italic>C. psittaci</italic> is frequently detected in birds from the tropical and subtropical regions, large outbreaks of human infections rarely occur. During the investigation of a human psittacosis outbreak that was associated with avian chlamydiosis in Hong Kong, we identified a novel adenovirus in epidemiologically linked Mealy Parrots, which was not present in healthy birds unrelated to the outbreak or in other animals. Since there was a positive correlation between the adenovirus viral load and 
  <italic>C. psittaci</italic> bacterial load in the lungs of the infected Mealy parrots and because adenoviruses are known to cause immunosuppression in birds, we speculate that our novel Psittacine adenovirus may have caused immunosuppression among infected parrots resulting in a larger number of Mealy Parrots being infected by 
  <italic>C. psittaci</italic> with a higher bacterial load, leading to a greater chance of zoonotic transmission to humans.
