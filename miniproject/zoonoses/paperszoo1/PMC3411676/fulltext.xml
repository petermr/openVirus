This report focuses on the clinical course and outcomes of infection in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A standardised data extraction form was used to obtain detailed clinical information from hospital case notes and electronic records, for patients with PCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection admitted to 13 sentinel hospitals in five clinical 'hubs' and a further 62 non-sentinel hospitals, between 11th May 2009 and 31st January 2010.Outcomes were compared for pregnant and non-pregnant women aged 15&#x02013;44 years, using univariate and multivariable techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 395 women aged 15&#x02013;44 years, 82 (21%) were pregnant; 73 (89%) in the second or third trimester. Pregnant women were significantly less likely to exhibit severe respiratory distress at initial assessment (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.49 (95% CI: 0.30&#x02013;0.82)), require supplemental oxygen on admission (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.40 (95% CI: 0.20&#x02013;0.80)), or have underlying co-morbidities (p-trend &#x0003c;0.001).

Three of the four mothers with apparent respiratory illness required Level 2/3 care and delivered pre-term babies, two requiring emergency caesarean section and one induced labour resulting in a still-birth. The fourth mother required emergency caesarean section but not Level 2/3 care, and delivered at term. In comparison, none of the ten mothers admitted predominantly for obstetric reasons required Level 2/3 care and only one delivered a pre-term baby by elective caesarean section.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the only study of which we are aware to present findings amongst pregnant women hospitalised during both waves of the 2009 pandemic in the UK. In addition, it is unique in its comparison of severe outcomes for pregnant and non-pregnant hospitalised cases of childbearing age with confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09, following careful adjustment for severity of illness at admission and other confounding variables.</p><p>The data collected were not independently verified and there was no attempt to obtain missing fields or follow-up cases, which may have resulted in some reporting bias. However, there was full extraction from case records, and comparison with non-pregnant women of the same age that also had A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, which illuminates the course of A(H1N1)pdm09 in pregnancy.</p><p>The high prevalence of pregnancy in this cohort of women aged 15&#x02013;44 years, aligns with previous studies which suggest a marked increase in the likelihood of admission with A(H1N1)pdm09 when compared with non-pregnant women of similar age. <xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-TheANZICInfluenza1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> In accordance with other published case series, <xref rid="pone.0041638-RollandHarris1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Louie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Jiminez1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Siston1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> the majority of women were in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, suggesting an increased risk of hospitalisation in the later stages of pregnancy, although this may be confounded by a failure to recognise some early pregnancies. Pregnant women were significantly less likely to have underlying co-morbidities than non-pregnant women of childbearing age, emphasising the importance of pregnancy itself as a risk factor for hospitalisation. But despite the increased likelihood of admission for pregnant women, we found little evidence of greater illness severity at initial hospital assessment, as suggested by our findings that pregnant women were less likely to present with respiratory distress or require supplemental oxygen on admission. This does not appear to be confounded by the use of antiviral medication, since pregnant women were, if anything less likely to receive this pre-admission. Other factors such as a lower threshold, or alternative primary indication for hospital admission (such as obstetric complication) may be of more importance. The reason for admission was, however, not always reported making it difficult to explore this further by stratified analysis. Three quarters (74%) of the pregnant cohort required a hospital stay of two days or more, suggesting that &#x02018;front door&#x02019; anxiety for the pregnant patient may not fully explain the increased admission rate.</p><p>There was no evidence of a greater likelihood of severe outcomes in pregnant women as indicated by length of stay, requirement for Level 2/3 care or mortality. This held true even when adjusted for severity of illness on admission and underlying co-morbidities, or when comparing outcomes in women with no co-morbidities, through sensitivity analysis. The burden of mortality in other cohorts of pregnant women hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 ranges from 1% <xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> to 6% <xref rid="pone.0041638-Louie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and is not dissimilar from that observed in this case series. The risk of admission to intensive care does, however, appear to vary, some case series reporting this to be lower <xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and others higher <xref rid="pone.0041638-TheANZICInfluenza1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> when compared with infected non-pregnant women of a similar age. This may be explained by different criteria for admission to Level 2/3 care which exist in different countries, although even when considering only the most seriously ill women who required mechanical ventilation, there was still no apparent increase in the risk of death for pregnant women in this cohort. Other studies have found pregnant women with confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 in critical care experience higher rates of viral pneumonia despite a lack of difference in mortality <xref rid="pone.0041638-MaraviPoma1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, but no statistically significant difference was observed in this cohort. Although this suggests that once hospitalised, outcomes for women of childbearing age in the FLU-CIN cohort were similar regardless of pregnancy, caution must be exercised due to the smaller number of observations and potential lack of power with which to detect a true underlying effect.</p><p>Inconsistency in the estimated size of effect of pregnancy on severity of outcomes following A(H1N1) pdm09 infection may also reflect a marked variation in the prevalence of underlying co-morbidities and residual confounding; not all reports adjusted for presence of co-morbidities in the same way.<xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041638-TheANZICInfluenza1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> It is possible that differences in the ethnic composition of the populations considered may also have a role to play.</p><p>Despite the apparent lack of effect of pregnancy on severe outcomes once hospitalised, it seems that influenza infection in pregnancy nevertheless has serious implications for maternal health since ten of the 11 pregnant women admitted to Level 2/3 care in this cohort required mechanical ventilation, and only three had co-morbid illnesses. Further studies with greater power are however required in order to definitively conclude this. Where co-morbidities were reported for pregnant women, asthma was most prevalent, which again aligns with observations in other case series. <xref rid="pone.0041638-Siston1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Mosby1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> Other data also suggest that A(H1N1)pdm09 cases with asthma experienced a reduced likelihood of severe outcome after admission. <xref rid="pone.0041638-NguyenVanTam1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Myles1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Pregnant women were quickly identified as a priority group for both early anti-viral treatment and vaccination in the UK, as elsewhere. There was widespread availability of antiviral drugs in the community following establishment of a National Pandemic Flu Service in July 2009 <xref rid="pone.0041638-Department1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and whilst 74% of pregnant women in this cohort were prescribed anti-viral medication only 10% (8/82) received these in the community prior to admission. It is difficult to determine whether earlier treatment would have altered the observed outcomes, but delayed treatment has been associated with an increased risk of severe illness in pregnant women in previous hospitalised case series. <xref rid="pone.0041638-Creanga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Siston1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> Although differences in antiviral drug uptake between pregnant and non-pregnant women are small, this suggests an ongoing need to emphasise the use of early anti-viral therapy on suspicion of influenza and promote its acceptability for use during pregnancy in a pandemic situation. <xref rid="pone.0041638-European1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> Evidence regarding the safety of Oseltamivir in pregnancy is, however, limited <xref rid="pone.0041638-Donner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Schatz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and further studies which focus on the risk of potential adverse events would clearly be of value.</p><p>Vaccination status was inconsistently recorded in medical notes and may in part be explained by the fact that the pandemic vaccine was not introduced in the UK until late October 2009, so 54 of the pregnant women in the cohort would either not have had the opportunity to be vaccinated, or would not have seroconverted (if vaccinated), prior to illness onset. Although there were large amounts of missing data, the fact that only 7% of those for whom the pandemic vaccine would have been available in time to have offered protection were noted to have had it, compared with 25% noted not to have had it, suggests that coverage was low, as observed in other hospitalised cohorts. <xref rid="pone.0041638-Hewagama1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Pierce1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> This further highlights the need to emphasise existing public health policy, and for healthcare workers, especially GPs and midwives, to advocate for vaccination against influenza during pregnancy.</p><p>Most women did not deliver during admission and were therefore not followed up as part of the FLU-CIN protocol. Of the sixteen women who did deliver during admission, three of the four who were admitted primarily with respiratory illness delivered pre-term babies and two mothers died post-partum. In comparison there was only one pre-term delivery and one maternal death amongst the ten women admitted for predominantly obstetric reasons. Adverse foetal outcomes following maternal influenza infection have previously been described, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Pierce1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041638-Centers2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and although these data must be interpreted with caution, they suggest a potential short-term impact of influenza infection on foetal as well as maternal health.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As judged by the need for hospital admission, this study corroborates previous evidence that pregnancy itself was a risk factor for significant illness due to A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. There is, however, little evidence from our data to suggest that maternal outcomes were any more or less severe than for non-pregnant women of a similar age in the UK, even when severity of illness at admission (indicated by respiratory distress), additional underlying co-morbidities and in-hospital anti-viral use were taken into account. However, some caution must be exercised due to the small numbers in the study. Despite national recommendations for early anti-viral treatment and vaccination, the former were either not accessed or not offered to one quarter of the pregnant women in this cohort at any point in the care pathway; and vaccine uptake was low amongst those for whom it was available.
