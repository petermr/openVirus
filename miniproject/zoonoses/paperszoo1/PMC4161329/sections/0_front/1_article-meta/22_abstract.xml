 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>In anticipation of continued pathogen emergence in the U.S. due to globalization climate change, and other factors, the development of proactive management plans and interventions to predict and then intervene is going to be more efficient and effective than retrospective plans developed after pathogen emergence. Effective management of mosquito-borne pathogens like Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) requires an understanding of the roles that different mosquito species and vertebrate hosts play in transmission. This study combines data on mosquito transmission efficiency, mosquito feeding patterns, and vertebrate infectiousness to quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of different mosquito species and vertebrate hosts to the amplification of RVFV in the U.S. We identify several species of floodwater 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes that would be the most likely vectors for RVFV, and hoofed ungulates (deer, cows, sheep) would be the most important amplifying vertebrate hosts. Although these data provide public and animal health agencies 
  <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge on the primary mosquitoes that should be targeted for vector control and the highest priority animals to receive vaccines, this analysis reveals many gaps in knowledge reducing our ability to predict and then manage a potential invasion of RVFV.
