RNA viruses pose an interesting case study given their mutation rates are orders of magnitude higher than any other pathogen &#x02013; as reflected by the recent emergence of SARS and Influenza for example. Here, we show how feature selection techniques can be used to reliably classify viral sequences by host species, and to identify the crucial minority of host-specific sites in pathogen genomic data. The variability in alleles at those sites can be translated into prediction probabilities that a particular pathogen isolate is adapted to a given host. We illustrate the power of these methods by: 1) identifying the sites explaining SARS coronavirus differences between human, bat and palm civet samples; 2) showing how cross species jumps of rabies virus among bat populations can be readily identified; and 3) <italic>de novo</italic> identification of likely functional influenza host discriminant markers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Moving away from genome scan methods used for human GWAS (ultimately inappropriate for the short highly polymorphic genomes of RNA viruses), our work shows the power and potential of multi-class machine learning algorithms in inferring the functional genetic changes associated with phenotypic change (e.g. crossing a species barrier). We show that even distantly related viruses within a viral family share highly conserved genetic signatures of host specificity; reinforce how fitness landscapes of host adaptation are shaped by host phylogeny; and highlight the evolutionary trajectories of RNA viruses in rapid expansion and under great evolutionary pressure. We do so by (for each dataset) unveiling a set of phenotype characteristic mutations which are shown to be functionally relevant, thus providing new insights into phenotypic relationships between RNA viruses. These methods also provide a solid statistical framework with which the degree of host adaptation can be inferred, thus serving as a valuable tool for studying host transition events with particular relevance for emerging infectious diseases. These methods can then serve as rigorous tools of emergence potential assessment, specifically in scenarios where rapid host classification of newly emerging viruses can be more important than identifying putative functional sites.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>We thank the EU FP7 EMPERIE project, the NIGMS MIDAS programme, and the MRC for research funding.

The wealth of pathogen sequence data becoming available makes identification of pathogen genomic markers of emergence one of the more promising approaches <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Pepin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, particularly for RNA viruses given their high mutation rate and resulting high diversity at the population level <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Drake1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>The identification of genetic markers predicting cross-species disease emergence faces many of the same challenges as genotype-to-phenotype mapping in other spheres, such as human genome-wide association studies of risk factors for chronic diseases <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Turnbull1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Principle among these are relatively small sample sizes coupled with a very large number of potential explanatory variables (single nucleotide substitutions and their interactions) <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-delosCampos1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Manolio1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, the much higher frequency of polymorphisms in RNA viruses and their fast population-level evolution offers unique challenges and opportunities.</p><p>While most viral variants generated in a specific host are selectively neutral in that host, upon crossing the species barrier they are under strong selective pressure. We expect selection to shape the relative frequencies of viral variants found in donor and recipient species. Specific hosts impose specific evolutionary landscapes on viruses which will translate into signature genetic sequences. We therefore expect comparisons of allele frequencies between sequences of the same pathogen isolated from different hosts to reveal a large subset of alleles which are conserved between host species and a smaller subset of host specific alleles. This comparison can be performed by statistical techniques able to discriminate phenotype (host) relevant variables (alleles). Here we apply feature selection methods which identify a subset of variable sites which can be used to build a robust phenotype classifier <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Guyon1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We focus on one algorithm for classification - the random forest algorithm (RFA) - that offers excellent performance in classification tasks, providing direct measures of variable importance and classification error <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-DiazUriarte1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Our goals are two-fold. First, we investigate how well feature-selection algorithms such as RFA can reliably classify RNA viruses according to their host species reservoir, thereby giving insight into pathogen evolution, and the frequency of cross-species transition events. Identification of functional polymorphisms is not critical in meeting this goal, though clearly is desirable. Second, we evaluate how well RFA can identify sets of sites that are functionally relevant to the phenotype of interest (in this case host species), in the context of dense RNA virus genomes and their high degree of linkage.</p><p>We first analyse polymerase gene sequences of RNA viruses to identify the genetic signatures predicting host species. As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g001">Figure 1a</xref> represents the diversity of Flavivirus polymerase amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s007">Table S2</xref>). Here we use principal component analysis (PCA) solely to visualise the variation between samples, not as a classification tool. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g001">Figure 1b</xref> illustrates how feature selection identifies amino acid positions which robustly classify samples by host species, resulting in clustering of samples which infect the same reservoir. The clustering of samples seen in the PCA plot is similar to that seen in the maximum likelihood tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g001">Figure 1c</xref>), supporting the use of PCA as a useful tool for generating low-dimensional representations of genetic variation.</p><fig id="pcbi-1003254-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003254.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Feature selection of host specific genetic signatures within Flaviviridae.</title><p>The scatterplots display the first two principal components of the PCA undertaken using allele frequency information from (a) Flaviviruses' full polymerase sequences and (b) an alignment of the amino acids selected by the random forest algorithm. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree obtained from full polymerase sequences is presented in (c). Tree branch lengths reflect the number of amino acid differences per sequence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003254.g001"/></fig><p>Second, we examine the potential of RFA applied as a phenotypic classifier to give insight into cross-species disease emergence. In this case, analysis of sequences of viruses which have fully adapted to particular host species &#x02013; as in the Flavivirus example &#x02013; is insufficient to distinguish between the subset of mutations required to allow cross-species emergence and later non-essential mutations which further increase viral fitness in a new species. We therefore need to examine data collected from zoonotic outbreaks. The 2003 SARS epidemic is a good example of a zoonosis which rapidly developed a high level of transmissibility in humans <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Fouchier1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Tsang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The pathogen was rapidly identified <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Fouchier1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and the origin of the virus was initially traced back to palm civets <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, before bats were identified as the natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We applied the RFA to nucleotide sequences of the spike protein of SARS-like coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s008">Table S3</xref>), recovered from human patients and palm civets from the 2003 and 2004 epidemics and bat sequences available in the Genbank database. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g002">Figure 2a</xref> illustrates the extent to which bat sequences differ from the human and palm civet sequences recovered in China in 2002&#x02013;2004, and also highlights the similarity of palm civet and human sequences <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Analysis of the variation in the selected host-discriminant viral alleles (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g003">Figure 3</xref>) reveals interesting relationships between host reservoirs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). Firstly, there is noticeable genetic variation in the samples from human SARS patients collected in the early and mid-stages of the 2003 epidemic, compatible with adaptation of the virus to a new host species. The late 2003 samples were less variable, suggesting selective pressures may by then have stabilized <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Consortium1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Secondly, human patient samples from a small outbreak in January 2004 are more closely related to palm civet 2004 samples than to any human sample from the previous year, indicating that the 2004 outbreak represented an independent cross species transition <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The palm civet samples from 2003 were collected a few months after the human epidemic ended so there might have been an accumulation of mutations responsible for the substantial distance between palm civet 2003 samples and human 2003 samples. However, the close proximity between the bat samples and the first samples from the human 2003 epidemic suggests that the transition from palm civet to human occurred quite rapidly after the transition from bat to palm civet. With respect to our second goal &#x02013; identifying functional relevant sites &#x02013; it is notable that 12 of the 15 positions identified by feature selection coded for non-synonymous substitutions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s009">Table S4</xref>), most of which are mapped onto the surface of the spike protein. It should be noted that of the 15 positions identified in the current study, 13 overlap with those found in <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Pickett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The functional relevance of the two unique positions (239 and 311) found here and that of the 13 unique positions identified in <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Pickett1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> is not clear. When running the RFA for amino acid sequences of the same viruses, we obtain a subset of 12 significant amino acid positions that are coded for by the exact same non-synonymous substitutions highlighted by the RFA conducted on the nucleotide sequences.</p><fig id="pcbi-1003254-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003254.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>SARS coronavirus species transitions and evolution.</title><p>The first two principal components of the PCA undertaken using (a) SARS coronavirus complete spike protein nucleotide sequences, and (b) nucleotides selected by the RFA.

However, cross-species transfer seems to be favoured between closely related host species <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Kuiken1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Streicker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Pedersen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, suggesting that the fitness landscape of host adaptation is shaped by host phylogeny. Streicker and colleagues <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Streicker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> defined lineages of rabies virus associated to particular bat taxa, identifying 43 cross species transmission events involving 15 bat species. Here we reanalyse the complete nucleoprotein sequences available for five of those bat species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s010">Table S5</xref>). PCA applied to these sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g004">Figure 4a</xref>) shows how viruses collected from 3 of the bats species (<italic>L. borealis, L. seminolus, L. cinereus</italic>) are extremely similar, with a substantially divergent lineage infecting <italic>E. fuscus</italic> bats and an isolated small cluster of viruses seen in <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic>. Applying RFA to predict host species to these sequences allows discrimination of <italic>L. cinereus</italic> specific traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g004">Figure 4b</xref>), but does not significantly separate the <italic>L. borealis</italic> and <italic>L. seminolus</italic> clusters. This suggests that transmission of rabies virus between these two bat species is much more frequent than between any other pair of species examined. The advantage of RFA compared with phylogenetic methods is that it allows a probability of &#x0201c;belonging&#x0201d; to each host bat species to be estimated for each virus sample. Thus we can examine whether a virus isolated in one species is in fact native to a different host species. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g004">Figure 4b</xref> highlights the 8 outlier sequences (T1&#x02013;T8) in this dataset &#x02013; viruses which are closer to rabies viruses native to a different species from that in which they were isolated. For these 8 viruses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g004">Figure 4c</xref> gives the RFA classification probabilities of these viruses to the 5 different host species considered. In six cases, the cross-species transitions thus identified agree with those identified in <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Streicker1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Five of these 8 transitions occurred between <italic>L. borealis</italic> and <italic>L. seminolus</italic>. This, and the relatively poor ability of RFA to choose between these species in classifying viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s011">Table S6</xref>), suggests that phylogenetic closeness between host species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s004">Figure S4</xref>) facilitates cross-species transmission.</p><fig id="pcbi-1003254-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003254.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Cross-species transition events of rabies viruses in bats.</title><p>The first two principal components of the PCA undertaken using (a) complete Rabies virus nucleoprotein sequences, and (b) an alignment of nucleotides selected by the RFA.

First, as a critical validation of the RFA, we analysed H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) amino acid sequences collected in human (pre and post 2009 pandemic) and swine hosts, since multiple sources of empirical evidence for the functional relevance of specific amino acids in that gene are available <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Matrosovich1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Neumann1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Tumpey1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Second, we analysed the PB2 Influenza A gene, since it is highly conserved across subtypes and its evolution has been hypothesised to reflect host specific adaptation <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Gorman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>The HA analysis serves not only as an assessment of the functional relevance of the positions being highlighted as host specific by RFA, but also as a benchmark of the method by direct comparison with a recently published study <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Meroz1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> which made use of an alternative feature-selection algorithm (Adaboost). We compare algorithm performance on three levels: prediction ability, percentage of selected amino acids in functionally relevant positions, and overlap of selected amino acids. We use full HA segment amino acid sequences and analyse the proportion of selected amino acids that fall in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), and in known antigenic sites. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003254-t001">Table 1</xref> summarises our findings by comparison with the Adaboost results <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Meroz1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. There is substantial overlap with the sets of relevant positions between the two methods, although RFA seems to consistently identify a larger proportion of amino acids in HA's receptor binding domain (RBD), particularly those that are also known antigenic sites, with a greater predictive ability. Even if one were to aggregate the Adaboost results (Adaboost can only undertake binary classification, so two comparisons were needed to explore host-specific determinants for 3 virus groups), that algorithm identifies 47 significant positions, 20 (42.5%) of which belong to the RBD, 7 (35%) in known antigenic sites. A multi-class RFA is able to identify a significant larger subset of amino acids in known antigen sites (12 in the RBD plus 2 others), the functional relevance of which can be explored in future experimental studies. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s012">Table S7</xref> lists all the positions selected as significant, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003254-g005">Figure 5</xref> portrays allelic diversity across the HA samples analysed and gives clear intuition into why the identified sites were selected by RFA. We should note the absence of the 190 and 225 mutations (hallmark mutations of human-adapted H1N1 HA) from the subset of significant residues determined by RFA. Although these mutations confer optimal contact with the sialic acid receptors <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Matrosovich1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, we find that 190D is highly conserved throughout our sequences, contrasting with the 190E amino acid found in avian samples. Residue 225 is picked as one of the 100 most informative sites for host discrimination by the RFA. All the virus groups examined contain samples with the 225D allele, while the 225G allele (the consensus in avian viruses) is present in some seasonal human and swine samples. Had we included avian samples in the analysis, the 225 positions would certainly be classified as highly host discriminant. Here, we identify other mutations which have empirically been found to influence contact with the &#x003b1;2&#x02013;6 glycans, either by providing additional anchoring sites for the sialic acid (position 145); by forming a network interacting with Asp190 (186, 187 and 189); or by modulating the stability of those contacts (219 and 227) <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Maines1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Srinivasan1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.

Bird viruses are also the least divergent comparison group from swine viruses, perhaps reflecting the avian origin of all influenza viruses, and that, for influenza, transmission between birds and some mammalian hosts (human and swine in this case) is more frequent than expected by their phylogenetic relationships, probably due to persistent exposure in domestic settings.</p><fig id="pcbi-1003254-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003254.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Computationally predicted structure of the 531&#x02013;738 subset of amino acids in the PB2 subunit of the polymerase protein of influenza A viruses.</title><p>For structural prediction we used the consensus sequence for the subset of viruses' samples collected from each host species.

First, we find that even relatively distantly related viruses within viral families &#x02013; that might be geographically isolated and transmitted by different routes &#x02013; share highly conserved genetic signatures of host specificity. Second, we see that the fitness landscapes of host adaptation are shaped by host phylogeny, with evolutionary barriers generally being lower between closely related host species, though not always (influenza A viruses transfer between birds and some mammalian hosts being a counter-example).

Although discriminant analysis approaches are typically marred by biases related to sampling efforts and founder effects <xref rid="pcbi.1003254-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, RFA enables the circumvention of some of these biases through cross-validation, sampling with replacement and attribution of weights to unequally sampled groups (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003254.s017">Text S1</xref> for more details).

Each tree in a random forest is trained on a bootstrap sample of the data, and at each split a random subset of the variables is chosen from all the available variables (in this case, a subset of positions in the sequence for each split). Final classification of each sample results from aggregating the votes of all trees in the forest. The importance measure of each variable is obtained as the loss of accuracy of classification caused by the random permutation of attribute values for that variable.
