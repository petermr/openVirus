 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen of great public health significance, which is endemic to tropical areas of Africa and South America. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, and programs that exist in many endemic areas to reduce populations of mosquitoes, YFV continues to circulate and emerge in regions with developing public health infrastructures. Periodic outbreaks of YFV into humans are unpredictable and merit thorough investigation of the ecology and genetic diversity of the virus. Our analyses improve the current understanding of African YFV evolution in several respects. We have included unpublished viral sequence data from Central and East Africa, which is significant because the availability of YFV isolates from these regions is extremely limited. We present a modeled geographic structure of African YFV dispersal, and propose a new model for the spread of YFV based on concurrent historical movement of the virus from reservoirs in central African jungles to both eastern and western regions of the continent. Our results provide evidence for the presence of unique genotypes of the virus in both central and east African circulation. The presented findings not only provide insight to estimations of outbreak risk for the regions in question, but also contribute to rational GIS analysis and approaches to vaccination campaigns.</p>
