 <p>This paper is dedicated to the memory of our co-author Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, who has recently died from Ebola virus. Dr. Khan was a leading doctor on the front lines fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. His dedication, courage and abnegation have been greatly recognized by the medical community and Sierra Leonean authorities who called Dr. Khan a “national hero” for his tremendous sacrifice in working to save the lives of more than 100 infected patients.</p>
