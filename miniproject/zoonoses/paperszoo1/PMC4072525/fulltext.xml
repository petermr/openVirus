</related-article><abstract><p>The early detection of disease epidemics reduces the chance of successful introductions into new locales, minimizes the number of infections, and reduces the financial impact. We develop a framework to determine the optimal sampling strategy for disease detection in zoonotic host-vector epidemiological systems when a disease goes from below detectable levels to an epidemic. We find that if the time of disease introduction is known then the optimal sampling strategy can switch abruptly between sampling only from the vector population to sampling only from the host population. We also construct time-independent optimal sampling strategies when conducting periodic sampling that can involve sampling both the host and the vector populations simultaneously. Both time-dependent and -independent solutions can be useful for sampling design, depending on whether the time of introduction of the disease is known or not. We illustrate the approach with West Nile virus, a globally-spreading zoonotic arbovirus. Though our analytical results are based on a linearization of the dynamical systems, the sampling rules appear robust over a wide range of parameter space when compared to nonlinear simulation models. Our results suggest some simple rules that can be used by practitioners when developing surveillance programs. These rules require knowledge of transition rates between epidemiological compartments, which population was initially infected, and of the cost per sample for serological tests.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Outbreaks of zoonoses can have large costs to society through public health and agricultural impacts. Because many zoonoses co-occur in multiple animal populations simultaneously, detection of zoonotic outbreaks can be especially difficult. We evaluated how to design sampling strategies for the early detection of disease outbreaks of vector-borne diseases. We built a framework to integrate epidemiological dynamical models with a sampling process that accounts for budgetary constraints, such as those faced by many management agencies. We illustrate our approach using West Nile virus, a globally-spreading zoonotic arbovirus that has significantly affected North American bird populations. Our results suggest that simple formulas can often make robust predictions about the proper sampling procedure, though we also illustrate how computational methods can be used to extend our framework to more realistic modeling scenarios when these simple predictions break down.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding provided by the NSF IGERT program (DGE-0801544) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.igert.org/">http://www.igert.org/</ext-link>.

Early detection can significantly reduce the costs associated with disease eradication, human illnesses, and devastation of livestock or crops. For example, the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth in Great Britain was reported only 2 weeks after the epidemic began <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> yet had an estimated financial impact of $11.9&#x02013;$18.4 billion dollars <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Thurmond1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A hypothetical foot and mouth epidemic in California not detected for 2 weeks could have a financial impact of over $15 billion dollars, and an epidemic not detected for 3 weeks could have an impact of up to $69 billion dollars <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Carpenter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although many studies have examined alternative control strategies and the impact of detection time on control <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Thurmond1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Tildesley1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, the complementary question of how to achieve early detection has been relatively neglected by theory. Greater attention to the design of disease surveillance methods may facilitate earlier detection and reduce the economic impacts of disease epidemics.</p><p>Passive surveillance methods are the voluntary reporting of cases by primary care providers and citizens to public health officials <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Hadorn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recent work on passive surveillance methods for human infectious diseases has progressed rapidly and includes developing methods to optimize the placement <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Polgreen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Scarpino1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and performance <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Fairchild1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> of surveillance sites. Integrating these physical surveillance systems with internet search data has led to improvements in the performance of traditional physical reporting systems <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Scarpino1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Milinovich1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Active surveillance methods of zoonotic diseases are the periodic sampling by health authorities <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Hadorn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For vector-borne diseases active surveillance may include the use of sentinel animals and the longitudinal sampling of vector populations <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Hochachka1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Active surveillance may often perform better for targeted objectives than passive methods <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Hadorn1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and recent work has begun to link active zoonotic surveillance data to epidemiological models. For example, Gerardo-Giorda <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Gerardogiorda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> combined surveillance data and epidemiological models to identify counties that were most important for surveillance efforts of rabies in New York State. It is likely that analytical approaches will prove useful in making active zoonotic surveillance methods more cost effective, an important consideration for surveillance organizations with limited resources <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Connelly1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Past analytical work on active disease detection examined how sampling for infected individuals in a susceptible population affects the time at which an epidemic is detected <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Metz1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Kelbert1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and the subsequent incidence of a disease at the time of discovery <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Parnell1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These studies have examined the dynamics of diseases that are directly transmitted and thus lack a disease vector. As a result, we still have little knowledge to guide early detection theory for zoonotic diseases (e.g., Lyme disease, malaria, Rift Valley fever virus, West Nile virus, dengue fever), where sampling could occur in vector populations or host populations. Here, we studied the optimal sampling design for early disease detection using formulations of a disease with one host population and one vector population. We combined models of host-vector dynamics with a periodic sampling procedure in which sample size is constrained by economic limitations. We used a susceptible-infected (SI) model to examine how to allocate sampling effort between the vector and host populations, and we used a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to look at allocating sampling effort between the vector population, infected hosts, and recovered hosts.</p><p>The CDC guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance of human based diseases <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-German1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> are standards that have been used in many assessments of zoonotic surveillance systems, although differences may exist between human and zoonotic surveillance goals <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Drewe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A recent survey on the assessment of surveillance systems found that a number of different metrics have been used to determine zoonotic surveillance performance; two of the most frequently mentioned criteria are the sensitivity of surveillance (the ability to detect outbreaks or infection rates) and the time to outbreak detection from initial exposure <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Drewe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Here we assume the goal of surveillance is to detect the outbreak as early as possible to minimize financial damages or spillover human infections, a common goal for zoonoses <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Connelly1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Our results provide some basic rules of thumb for practitioners designing active surveillance protocols for vector-borne diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Models</title><p>We modeled the early dynamics of a disease with a single vector species and a single, non-human host species. Here we define early-time approximations to systems where vectors follow SI dynamics and hosts follow either SI- or SIR- dynamics. We then define a sampling model that can be applied to these dynamical systems. The sampling of human hosts often has additional considerations not accounted for in this sampling framework. We therefore address specific issues about human populations in the discussion.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Vector-host SI model</title><p>We made assumptions common to other SI models of vector-borne diseases: vectors and hosts can be in either a susceptible or an infected state at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula>, the disease epidemic (the dynamics of interest) occur on a relatively short time-scale and thus infected individuals cannot recover nor do individuals give birth or die over the course of the epidemic, and infection spreads only through interspecific interactions <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-McCormack1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Very little past work in mathematical epidemiology has focused on early detection despite these potential benefits. One of the important products of this analysis has been to explicitly define the kinds of data that will be needed to design basic surveillance studies. Specific knowledge about the costs associated with sampling different populations and information about disease transmission rates will be necessary when making very specific predictions, but, as we have shown, applying the procedure with only basic knowledge of these quantities can make predictions that may be robust. This is fortunate for monitoring agencies as ecological and epidemiological parameters can be difficult and costly to obtain. Our analyses of West Nile virus illustrates robustness to parameters that are often unknown over a variety of models and assumptions.</p><p>Although we focused on basic SI and SIR models, this framework can be easily extended to include more specific models when they are available. It is likely that West Nile virus models that incorporate more biological realism (e.g., <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Wonham1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>) will be necessary to provide more targeted advice concerning surveillance practices for specific management agencies, whose monitoring capabilities may differ from what was assumed in this work. However, because the timescales we are examining are relatively short, our models may provide robust predictions when sampling is conducted over limited spatial scales. Therefore, even the simplified models examined here may be useful for designing sampling strategies when more detailed ecological and epidemiological information is not available.</p><p>Our results suggest that the optimal sampling design will often focus all sampling effort on a particular species or compartment. This result is due to the linear nature of the cost functions and the approximately linear nature of the dynamical systems as functions of our control variable, the sample sizes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e407.jpg"/></inline-formula>. These on-off or &#x0201c;bang-bang&#x0201d; types of solutions arise in other epidemiological problems when determining how to treat or remove individuals in infected populations to stop an epidemic <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Morton1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Forster1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. More recent work on the control of epidemics suggests that when considering multiple control strategies the optimal solution is not simply an additive combination of the independent control solutions <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Similar results may hold for surveillance methods when combining different types of surveillance strategies, for example active and passive sampling strategies. In cases where linearity and large population approximations for the dynamics do not hold, our analysis suggests that the optimal sampling design can be a mixture of sampling strata but this occurs over a very limited parameter space for West Nile virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003668-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Nonlinear cost functions may also arise when the cost per sample changes when performing a large number of samples due to reductions in the associated personnel costs or in the laboratory fees incurred in performing a large number of tests. Changing the dynamical model by incorporating more detailed ecological and epidemiological considerations may also reduce the robustness of our linearization approximation. For example, introducing spatial structured populations <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> or heterogeneous contact rates are known to lead to additional nonlinearities in incidence functions <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Roy1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>There are several additional considerations that may improve upon our efforts. Many disease models include exposed compartments (e.g., malaria <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Mandal1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>) in the host and/or vector population that can delay the onset of infectiousness once bitten. This may lead to additional possibilities in the switch time analysis that we did not consider. For example, if a host population is initially infected but has a long exposed period then there may be a quick switch to sampling the vector population followed by switches at longer time scales back to the host population. Additional important developments include treating the initial conditions and transmission process as random variables. This will likely lead to a distribution of optimal strategies rather than a single, fixed strategy <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Kendrick1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Recognizing uncertainty in the initial conditions may be especially important when the source of infection is unclear given the potential sensitivity of the sampling process to the initial infections. We also did not consider the possibility of testing for multiple pathogens in this analysis. For example in Florida, mosquito control agencies regularly screen for malaria, West Nile virus, and dengue fever among others <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Connelly1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Applying a mixed sampling strategy may allow managers to hedge their bets because the optimal strategy for West Nile virus may not necessarily translate to the early detection of other pathogens. Finally, our assumption that diagnostic tests for pathogen or antibodies provide perfect indicators of an individual's state may be violated by several factors. First, immunological dynamics can lead to low viral or antibody levels even when individuals have been infected, which may lead to low test reliability <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Paweska1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Extending the approach to coupled immunological-epidemiological models may account for this source of uncertainty. Second, and perhaps more importantly, imperfect diagnostic test reliability can arise due to stochastic factors that cannot be accounted for in conventional lab techniques. These effects can be incorporated into a sampling model by multiplying the economic efficiency by a random variable representing the test sensitivity and specificity <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Donald1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the recognized impact of emerging zoonoses on human health <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-LloydSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> we are aware of no work that attempts to integrate the active surveillance systems explored here with disease surveillance in humans. In diseases where humans are spillover hosts, such as West Nile virus, low human incidence is expected. Passive surveillance is often more economically efficient when dealing with rare events <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Doherr1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> but this reporting process differs from the assumptions made in this work. In passive surveillence the reporting effort will often vary through time due to seasonal and institutional effects. Incorporating these factors into a predictive framework will require the statistical analyses of these patterns <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Gerardogiorda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. When including the surveillance of humans for West Nile virus we expect that reductions in the time to detection will occur when the recovery rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1003668.e408.jpg"/></inline-formula>) is high or the human population size is low relative the the vector population, as this is when hosts are most efficient to sample for detecting the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003668-g004">Figure 4</xref>), though the particular effects will depend on the amount of sampling effort and the transmission rate to humans from the vector. In general we expect that accounting for passive human surveillance of zoonoses may change the optimal active surveillance strategy for wildlife populations as it may not be necessary to sample hosts that have strong interactions with humans or species that significantly lag behind the epidemiological response of humans.</p><p>Another important case that we did not consider here are zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza, which spread much more easily within one zoologic species than across-species. For these diseases, the goal of surveillance is to detect a subtype of the disease more virulent in humans, indicated by sustained human to human transmission. This sampling needs to be tailored to detect clusters of human cases linked to a single avian-to-human transmission that deviate from what is to be expected from low-level human-to-human and bird-to-human transmission <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Ferguson2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. This kind of surveillance will require more detailed contact tracing that is not accounted for in our framework, though the basic structure we have described here could still be applied. More complex statistical analyses will also be needed to determine whether levels of infecteds and recovereds are significantly higher than background levels in order to determine if an outbreak is occurring. Analyses such as those determining epidemic thresholds from public health data (e.g. <xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Ferguson2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1003668-Kleinman1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>) will be useful starting points for integrating thresholds into detecting epidemics of endemic zoonotic diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1003668.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
