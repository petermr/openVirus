Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people's lives and preventing epidemics. Additionally, general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments useful in fighting COVID-19 are addressed. This review sets out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 and host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection and taking immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection. Moreover, the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the Main protease (Mpro) is available.

The common domain architectures of coronavirus N protein are consisting of three distinct but highly conserved parts: An N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD), a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), and intrinsically disordered central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker. Previous studies have revealed that the NTD are responsible for RNA binding, CTD for oligomerization, and (SR)-rich linker for primary phosphorylation, respectively [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>].

It is time-consuming and expensive to design novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies [<xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Thus, choosing the method of immune-informatics is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens, B- and T-cell linear epitope prediction, and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens. Among those can be analyzed, B-cell can recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection, T-cell and antibody reactions may recover extreme respiratory infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>

[<xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features were identified. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development, as described by Li et al. [<xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8"><label>8</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0165">As noted before, COVID-19 has become a global concern, due to widespread outbreaks and lack of treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to find and evaluate treatment methods more quickly in this case computer methods are very effective and helpful. The predicted binding and ranking of drugs will also be useful to interpret the results of ongoing clinical trials that are testing existing drugs for effectiveness against COVID-19. Notwithstanding the limitations, it has been described several diseases and traits which may be causally related to ACE2 expression the lung, which in turn may mediate susceptibility to Sars-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the proteome-wide MR analysis revealed proteins that could lead to changes in ACE2 expression. Subsequent drug repositioning analysis highlighted several candidates that may warrant further investigations. We stress that most of the findings require replications and validation in further studies, especially the part on drug repositioning. Nevertheless, it is believed that this work is of value given the urgency to address the outbreak of Sars-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0170">This study was supported by <funding-source id="gs1"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100004366</institution-id><institution>Tabriz University of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> with grant number 65174.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Declaration of competing interestCOI</title><p id="p0175">None to declare.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahlquist</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Noueiry</surname><given-names>A.O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>W.-M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kushner</surname><given-names>D.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Dye</surname><given-names>B.T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Host factors in positive-strand RNA virus genome replication</article-title><source>J.
