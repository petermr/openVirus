millions of lives and have occurred for many centuries. Fortunately, they have been
largely eliminated by the use of vaccinations and drugs. More recently, Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and now
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have arisen, and given the current absence of highly
effective approved vaccines or drugs, brute-force approaches involving physical barriers
are being used to counter virus spread. A major basis for physical protection from
respiratory infections is eye, nose, and mouth protection. However, eye protection with
goggles is problematic due to &#x0201c;fogging&#x0201d;, while nose/mouth protection is
complicated by the breathing difficulties associated with non-valved respirators. Here,
we give a brief review of the origins and development of face masks and eye protection
to counter respiratory infections on the basis of experiments conducted 100 years ago,
work that was presaged by the first use of personal protective equipment,
&#x0201c;PPE&#x0201d;, by the plague doctors of the 17<sup>th</sup> Century. The results
of the review lead to two conclusions: first, that eye protection using filtered eye
masks be used to prevent ocular transmission; second, that new, pre-filtered, valved
respirators be used to even more effectively block viral transmission.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>id0c00291</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>id0c00291</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="sec1">The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most serious global
pandemic in 100 years. However, in the past, there have been many other, far more deadly
pandemics or epidemics, primarily, the Black Death,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> smallpox,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> and influenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup>, each of which killed hundreds of millions
of individuals. So, what have we learned about how to control (or prevent) pandemics? While
vaccinations and/or effective drugs would by definition solve the current COVID-19 problem
and it is often said that these are 12&#x02013;18 months away, the questions arise: what do
we do &#x0201c;next time&#x0201d; when a new pandemic threatens? What can be done in the
shorter term to protect healthcare workers? What smallpox, influenza, pneumonic plague, and
COVID-19 have in common is that they are transmitted by a respiratory route as well as in
many cases via the eye. We thus give a brief history of how viral and bacterial transmission
routes were discovered, since this leads to new ways to more effectively prevent
transmission.</p><sec id="sec2"><title>Coughs and Sneezes Spread Diseases: 100 Years of &#x0201c;Masks&#x0201d;</title><p>On October 12, 1918, just over one hundred years ago, Doust and Lyon reported in the
<italic>Journal of the American Medical Association</italic> the results of an
investigation into the effects of face masks on infections of the respiratory tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> They chose the bacterium <italic>Bacillus prodigiosus</italic> (now called
<italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, an opportunistic pathogen), and a volunteer was
instructed to gargle with a suspension of the organism. Agar plates were then placed at 1,
2, 3, . . ., 10 ft, and the volunteer was instructed to talk in an ordinary conversational
tone for 5 or 30 min or a loud tone for 5 min or to cough as much as possible for 5 min. The
volunteer then left the room; plates were exposed for 10 min (for large droplets to settle),
followed by 72 h of incubation and colony counting (which was facilitated due to the
production of the red pigment, prodigiosin, by the bacterium). The results were fascinating
in that they showed there was a &#x0201c;<bold>4 ft danger zone</bold> about the
patient&#x0201d; during normal or loud speech and this extended to &#x0201c;<bold>a minimum
radius of 10 ft</bold>&#x0201d; during coughing. These results led to the first concept of
social distancing, now at &#x0223c;6 ft (2 m). About 100 years later, high-speed
cameras<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> and laser
light scattering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> have been used to study particulate emissions, the
conclusions being in accord with the century old work; that is, coughs and sneezes spread
diseases and so does talking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></p><p>In the second part of the Doust and Lyon experiment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> it was concluded
that face masks made of coarse or medium gauze from two to ten layers did not prevent the
projection of inhaled material during coughing and that &#x0201c;such masks are worthless,
therefore, in preventing the dissemination of respiratory infections&#x0201d;. However,
&#x0201c;three-layer butter cloth masks were effective and should be worn in connection with
respiratory diseases&#x0201d;. This is the genesis of the use of face masks to prevent the
transmission of infective droplets, carried out at the time of the Spanish flu pandemic.</p><p>In another paper, in October 1919, Hurley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> reviewed the Doust and Lyon
paper and made the following proposal: &#x0201c;It is a reasonable corollary to deduce from
their experiments that if the infected subject <bold>or carrier</bold> and the noninfected
person both wore three-ply butter-cloth face masks when in contact, the protection afforded
the noninfected would be doubly efficient and secure. In other words, <bold>during an
influenza epidemic if everyone would, or was required to wear a face mask of that
character the transmission of the infection from those in the incubation period, sick,
convalescent, or from well carriers to the healthy noninfected population would be greatly
minimized</bold>&#x0201d;. This is the first proposal for the universal use of face masks
as well as an interesting comment about &#x0201c;well [asymptomatic] carriers&#x0201d;.</p><p>Face masks have indeed been widely used in many parts of Asia since the earlier SARS
(SARS-Cov-1) epidemic in 2002&#x02013;2003 as well as in influenza outbreaks and are now
being mandated in many countries outside Asia. However, as noted by Kellogg and Macmillan in
1920,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> simple masks such as those used by Doust and Lyon are
susceptible to leakages around the edges of the masks, which would reduce their efficiency
in blocking virus transmission from an infected donor to an uninfected acceptor. They also
estimated only an &#x0223c;50% efficacy in blocking droplet transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>More recently, N95 &#x0201c;respirators&#x0201d; have been developed that are quite effective
in blocking particle inhalation. They have a very complex microstructure, and the
&#x0201c;95&#x0201d; refers to the specification that such masks block 95% of the entry of 0.3
&#x003bc;m particles, which unfortunately means that 5% of particles are not trapped; these
could be infective given that masks may need to be worn for extended time periods. The
question then arises: why not make &#x0201c;N100&#x0201d; respirators that block 100% particle
(virus, bacterial droplet, aerosol) inhalation? In fact, N100 respirators are made, by the
3M Company, and are designed to block 99.97% particulate inhalation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup>. So,
why are N100 respirators not generally discussed? Presumably, this is due to the fact that,
while N95 (or KN95) masks are in short supply, N100 masks are in even shorter supply.
However, technologically, it is possible to reduce particle transmission from &#x0223c;5%
(N95) to &#x0223c;0.03% (N100), which corresponds to a &#x0223c;170&#x000d7; improvement in
blocking particle transmission, at least via the nose and mouth. The percentage of particles
that penetrate a surgical mask is very variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> and probably averages
around 30%.</p><p>On the other hand, while N95 or N100 respirator masks are highly efficacious in blocking
the intake of particles, they are far more difficult to breathe through than are face masks,
leading to the desirability of a medical evaluation prior to use. The high impedance of
N95/N100 respirators is considerably reduced by the incorporation of a simple
&#x0201c;flapper&#x0201d; valve (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a) that
reduces the work required in exhalation, albeit at a loss of much of the efficacy in
trapping exhaled particles. While this is of course not a problem when the
respirator&#x02019;s sole purpose is to trap &#x0201c;dust&#x0201d; particles, it reduces a
respirator&#x02019;s efficiency in trapping exhaled viral/bacterial infectious droplets since
they can pass straight through the valve. This has resulted in a directive prohibiting the
use of valved respirators as acceptable &#x0201c;face coverings&#x0201d; for the general
public in San Francisco, CA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Filtered nose/mouth respirators and filtered eye masks. (a) Standard N95 respirator,

surgical mask on the inside of the respirator mask valve as a pre-filter, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b. Unlike the use of full surgical masks for protection,
in which there are inevitable leakages around the edges of the mask on inhalation and
exhalation, a pre-filtered, valved respirator will provide excellent protection against both
inhaled particles, droplets and aerosols, at or slightly better than the efficiency of the
unfiltered respirator (since even a &#x0201c;closed valve&#x0201d; may leak slightly) as well
as a major reduction in the level of exhaled particles, comparable to or better than that
afforded by leaky surgical masks.</p><p>As suggested by Hurley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> in 1919, having both infected donors and
uninfected acceptors wear masks will reduce the incidence of transmission and that incidence
will be given to a first approximation by the product of the probability that a particle
escapes from the donor mask multiplied by the probability that it enters the acceptor mask.
For example, for the 50% efficiency face mask value suggested by Kellogg and
Macmillan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> if the donor generates <italic>N</italic> particles in a
given volume, that would by definition be reduced to <italic>N</italic>/2 by the donor mask,
a value that would then be reduced to <italic>N</italic>/4 by the acceptor mask, a factor of
4 reduction from the no-mask case. For two N95 masks, the result would be on the order of
(5/100)<sup>2</sup> = 0.0025 or 400&#x000d7;, and for two N100 masks, it would be
&#x0223c;(0.03/100)<sup>2</sup> = 9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup> or
&#x0223c;10<sup>7</sup>&#x000d7;. For filtered, valved respirators, the effects would be less
but would still be very large. However, transmission of infective particles is not just via
the nose/mouth.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Your Doctor Needs Goggles: You Do Too</title><p>In 1919, Maxcy carried out a second set of remarkable experiments using
<italic>B.&#x000a0;prodigiosus</italic> in a paper entitled &#x0201c;The transmission of
infection through the eye&#x0201d;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> This was carried out at the time of
the third wave of the Spanish flu pandemic, and in the introduction to his paper, Maxcy
stated that: &#x0201c;Recently the eye has received little or no attention as a factor in the
transmission of acute respiratory infections. It has been disregarded in planning measures
for the prevention of the spread of contagious diseases. This was especially true in the
recent epidemic of influenza&#x0201d;.</p><p>Maxcy then calculated the relative importance of eye, nose, and mouth exposure to direct
droplet spray (including estimates of the effect of blinking, expiration/air currents, and
talking) and concluded that there was a 600 mm<sup>2</sup> area of eye exposure but only 100
mm<sup>2</sup> for the nose and very little for mouth exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup>.
Building on the work of Doust and Lyon, Maxcy then instilled
<italic>B.&#x000a0;prodigiosus</italic> into one eye in each of five subjects. The results
were that bacteria instilled into the conjunctival sac were recovered on a nasal swab within
5 min of the instillation. Then, after 15&#x02013;30 min, bacteria were recovered (via a long
wire swab) from the nasopharynx, and 24 h later, they were recovered from stool samples,
just as with COVID-19. Thus, bacteria can enter the respiratory system via the eye,
nasolacrimal duct, and nasopharyngeal system, as can other respiratory
viruses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> as illustrated
in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Illustration of the entry of viruses (or bacteria) into the respiratory system. Both
viruses and bacteria can enter via the eyes as well as by the nose and mouth. In the
eyes, lacrimal gland secretions and blinking sweep pathogens into the nasolacrimal duct
and thence to the nasopharynx and then to the lungs. Entry into the nose leads more
directly to the nasopharynx and lungs. Lacrimal gland secretions are also responsible
for the fogging of hermetically sealed goggles, reducing their utility. In an infected
individual, exhalation via the nose and mouth contributes to disease transmission.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="id0c00291_0002" id="GRAPHIC-d7e283-autogenerated" position="float"/></fig><p>Maxcy then noted that: &#x0201c;The obvious means of protection is the wearing of a large
lens or pair of goggles in addition to the gauze mask by those who are within range of a
droplet spray from heavily infected individuals. In this connection, it is interesting to
note that during the great epidemics of plague that have from time to time swept over the
Old World, masking of the whole face, eyes included, has been wonderfully effective&#x0201d;.
The comment by Maxcy is remarkably prescient, and it is of interest to note the many
similarities between the first personal protective equipment, &#x0201c;PPE&#x0201d;, worn by
the 17<sup>th</sup> Century plague doctors and the PPE used at present, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Comparison between the personal protective equipment, PPE, used by the 17<sup>th</sup>

influenza, pneumonic plague, and smallpox as well as for other respiratory viruses, a second
transmission route exists and is via the eyes, which is of course why healthcare workers
wear goggles. The problem with wearing goggles is that, if they are hermetically sealed,
they very rapidly fog up, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c, while if they
are ventilated (have holes), they do not protect against aerosols. The problem of fogging
arises because aqueous secretions are continuously produced by the lacrimal glands, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, and in a hermetically sealed environment,
condensation occurs. One ingenious approach to solving the &#x0201c;foggy goggles&#x0201d;
problem is the development of filtered eye masks, FEMs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> which
incorporate a vent that is protected from aerosols by a filter, such as a piece of an N95
mask. Such a filtered eye mask based on (hermetically sealed, swimming) goggles was recently
reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> in which there was a major increase in the time required for
fogging, from 5 min to &#x0003e;1 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c,d), and
it seems very likely that this first proof-of-principle experiment will soon be improved
upon by the use of hydrophilic, anti-fog coatings, as currently used in vented goggles
(which do not protect against infectious aerosolized particles).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that very large numbers of healthcare
workers are being infected, and without improvements in PPE, this would likely occur in
future respiratory disease outbreaks in which the ocular route is also involved. The
development and use of filtered eye masks would decrease infection, and pre-filtered N100
masks would decrease infection as well as transmission. For the general public, very early
use of eye as well as nose/mouth protection would again reduce the number of infected
individuals, making testing, contact tracing, and isolation more feasible. However, it does
appear that prompt action involving contact tracing/isolation combined with the universal
use of PPE has been effective in Taiwan and Austria, at least so far, although face masks
are still required in Wuhan and Taiwan, and eye protection may also be needed. What is not
known is the degree to which &#x0201c;herd immunity&#x0201d; (without vaccines) will be
effective in reducing overall morbidity and mortality: the Swedish Experiment, results of
which are eagerly awaited.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement" id="notes1"><p>The authors declare no competing financial interest.</p></notes><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank David Douglas, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, for providing Figure
