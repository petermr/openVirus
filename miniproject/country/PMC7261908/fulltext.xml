Most antiviral drugs act as passive defenders to inhibit viral replication inside the cell, while a few of them function as gate keepers to combat viruses outside the cell, including fusion inhibitors, e.g., enfuvirtide, and receptor antagonists, e.g., maraviroc, as well as virus inactivators (including attachment inhibitors). Different from fusion inhibitors and receptor antagonists that must act in the presence of target cells, virus inactivators can actively inactivate cell-free virions in the blood, through interaction with one or more sites in the envelope glycoproteins (Envs) on virions. Notably, a number of protein- and peptide-based virus inactivators (PPVIs) under development are expected to have a better utilization rate than the current antiviral drugs and be safer for <italic>in vivo</italic> human application than the chemical-based virus inactivators. Here we have highlighted recent progress in developing PPVIs against several important enveloped viruses, including HIV, influenza virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV), and the potential use of PPVIs for urgent treatment of infection by newly emerging or re-emerging viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>enveloped virus</kwd><kwd>envelope proteins</kwd><kwd>inactivation</kwd><kwd>virus inactivator</kwd><kwd>emerging viruses</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="163"/><page-count count="19"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus and many other viruses are enveloped viruses (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Harrison, 2008</xref>). In most cases, viral envelope derives from the host cell membrane, while in some cases, it derives from the organelle membrane. For example, the envelope of both DENV and ZIKV derives from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Kuhn et al., 2002</xref>). One or more envelope glycoproteins (Envs) are expressed on the surface of the viral envelope and can play important roles in viral entry into the target cell, including attaching the virus to surface receptor of the host cell and mediating virus-cell membrane fusion, allowing the viral genome to enter the host cell for replication (<xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">Vigant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The outbreak of infectious diseases caused by highly pathogenic enveloped viruses, such as HIV, has posed threat to public health worldwide. Thus, it is essential to develop safe and effective antiviral drugs to combat these infectious diseases (<xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Since the first antiviral drug for treatment of HIV infection, zidovudine, was approved for clinical use in 1987, the United States FDA has approved &#x0003e;80 antiviral drugs so far. They are mainly applied to treat and prevent infection of HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), influenza virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhuri et al., 2018</xref>). However, most of these antiviral drugs are considered as &#x0201c;passive defenders&#x0201d; because they have to enter the virus-infected cells to inhibit viral replication in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, these drugs must possess the ability to penetrate the cell membranes without affecting the normal function of the intracellular proteins. Consequently, they have the weakness of relatively low utilization rate because most part of a drug remaining outside the infected cells does not participate in inhibition of viral infection.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of current antiviral drugs and the protein- and peptide-based inactivators, taking HIV as the example. <bold>(A)</bold> Major targets and mechanisms of the current anti-HIV drugs. They must act in the presence of target cells: receptor antagonists bind the cell surface receptor to prevent the virus binding and fusion inhibitors target the fusion process, while other inhibitors target viral replication in HIV-infected cells, including nucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors (INIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). <bold>(B)</bold> Targets and action mechanisms of the protein- and peptide-based HIV inactivators.

As mentioned above, viral entry can be divided into two steps: viral attachment to cell receptor(s) and then viral fusion with the target cell. Therefore, &#x0201c;gate keepers&#x0201d; can be classified into three groups: attachment inhibitors that inhibiting the attachment of virions to the target cell by blocking binding of viral Env (e.g., gp120) to cellular the receptor (e.g., soluble CD4) (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Deen et al., 1988</xref>), receptor antagonists that bind to the cell surface receptor to prevent binding of virions to the receptor (e.g., maraviroc) (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Fatkenheuer et al., 2005</xref>), and fusion inhibitors that inhibit fusion between viral and target cell membranes (e.g., enfuvirtide) (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1993a</xref>, <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Lalezari et al., 2003</xref>). In general, attachment inhibitors possess some virus inactivation abilities in mechanism, more or less, due to their ability to block the receptor-binding site (RBS) on viral Envs (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, attachment inhibitors belong to virus inactivators here; and &#x0201c;gate keepers&#x0201d; includes virus inactivators, receptor antagonists, and fusion inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Different from fusion inhibitors and receptor antagonist blockers that must act in the presence of target cells, virus inactivators can actively attack and inactivate cell-free virions in the blood, through interaction with one or more sites in Envs on virions. The mechanisms of virus inactivators vary: they can bind and block the RBS on viral Envs (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), or induce the conformational change of Env, causing virions to lose the ability to enter the host cell (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Some other inactivators may bind to the Env stem or the viral lipid membrane, to disrupt the integrity of the viral envelope or lead to the release of viral genetic materials (<xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because they can actively attack and then inactivate cell-free virions anywhere they meet in the blood, they should have higher utilization rate than the current antiviral drugs. They are expected to be much safer for <italic>in vivo</italic> human application than the chemical-based virus inactivators (e.g., detergents), most of which can non-specifically lyse lipid membranes of viruses and cells (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Polsky et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2000</xref>).

We have also discussed their advantages and disadvantages, compared with the traditional antiviral drugs and the potential application for urgent treatment of infection by newly emerging and re-emerging viruses.</p><sec id="S1.SS1"><title>Protein- and Peptide-Based HIV Inactivators</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus primarily targets the immune system, including CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages.

The immune system of the HIV-infected patient is gradually destroyed, eventually resulting in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Moir et al., 2011</xref>). More than 40 anti-HIV drugs have been approved by the United States FDA, most of which are reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs, including NRTIs and NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs) and integrase inhibitors (INIs) (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Deeks et al., 2015</xref>). They must enter HIV-infected cells to inhibit viral replication. The only peptide-based HIV fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide (also known as T20) (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">Wild et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Lalezari et al., 2003</xref>), and a small-molecule CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Fatkenheuer et al., 2005</xref>), must act on the cell surface where the virus binds to the cellular receptor (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). These drugs have shown good effects in combating HIV; however, they cannot attack the cell-free virions in the blood, thus also having the problem of low utilization rate.</p><p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein is originally expressed as the gp160 glycoprotein precursor, approximately 850 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is cleaved by viral protease to form a highly glycosylated trimer of heterodimers, non-covalently associated by three gp120 and three gp41 subunits (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The surface subunit gp120 is approximately 500 amino acids in length, composed of several variable regions V1&#x02013;V5 and the remaining more conserved regions (<xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Starcich et al., 1986</xref>). A conserved binding site to the cellular receptor CD4 (CD4bs) is found on the surface of the gp120 subunit, which contains the conserved hydrophobic Phe-43 pocket (residues 362&#x02013;372). The transmembrane subunit gp41, approximately 350 amino acids in length, is comprised of the fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR), C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR), membrane-proximal external region (MPER), transmembrane region (TM), and cytoplasmic region (CP). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, HIV-1 entry is originated by gp120 binding to the CD4 molecule on the target cell, resulting in its conformational change to expose the coreceptor-binding site (CoRbs) on gp120, further allowing gp120 binding to the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Chan and Kim, 1998</xref>). Subsequently, gp41 also changes conformation by inserting its FP into the target cell membrane to form a prehairpin fusion intermediate conformation (PFI) (<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Melikyan, 2008</xref>). Then, NHRs and CHRs of the three gp41 subunits interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) core structure, bringing the viral envelope and cell membrane into close proximity to achieve fusion (<xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the HIV-1 Env composed of gp120 and gp41 subunits is a key component responsible for mediating entry of the virion into the target cell, and also an important target for development of the protein- and peptide-based HIV-1 inactivators (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Souza et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Structure of HIV-1 Env in the native and fusion-intermediate states, which serve as targets for protein- and peptide-based HIV inactivators. <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of HIV-1 Env composition, including the surface subunit gp120 and the transmembrane subunit gp41.

Binding of gp120 with CD4 on the target cell surface triggers conformational change of gp120 with the exposure of the CoRbs, allowing gp120 binding to its coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. Subsequently, gp41 changes its conformation, resulting in the insertion of fusion peptide (FP) of gp41 into the target cell membrane and formation of the pre-fusion intermediate (PFI) state. The N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHRs and CHRs) of the three gp41 subunits interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) structure, which brings the viral envelope and target cell membrane together to achieve fusion.

(2012)</xref> proposed, for the first time, the strategy of designing and developing a protein-based HIV-1 inactivator, 2DLT, for inactivating cell-free HIV-1 virions in the absence of target cells (<xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Sanders, 2013</xref>). 2DLT, a bivalent recombinant protein, consists of three parts: (1) the D1D2 domain of CD4 (2D), (2) a 35-amino acid linker (L), and (3) T1144 (T), a peptide-based HIV fusion inhibitor (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Dwyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2009</xref>). Binding of D1D2 in 2DLT to the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) in HIV-1 gp120 triggers the formation of a gp120/gp41 pre-fusion intermediate (PFI), in which gp41 NHR is partially exposed (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Haim et al., 2009</xref>). The T1144 portion in 2DLT then binds the exposed NHR, resulting in the destabilization of PFI thus inactivation of the cell-free virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The results from the virus inactivation assay indicated that 2DLT could effectively inactivate cell-free HIV-1 virions, including laboratory-adapted strains and primary isolates of different subtypes with an EC50 (Half maximal effective concentration causing virus inactivation) between 17.3 and 78.6 nM, which is about two&#x02013;six fold more potent than D1D2 alone, while T1144 alone had no virus inactivation activity (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, this bivalent protein can actively attack the cell-free virions anywhere in blood when they meet and irreversibly inactivate the cell-free virions through a double hit by targeting gp120 and gp41 simultaneously or sequentially (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Sanders, 2013</xref>). Subsequently, the antiviral effects of 2DLT in combination with different anti-HIV drugs were explored, including HIV entry inhibitors, NRTIs, NNRTIs and protease inhibitors. The results indicated that the combination of 2DLT with these drugs brought about synergism or strong synergism against infection of both X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains (<xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Actually, several anti-HIV proteins or peptides with HIV inactivation activity similar to that of 2DLT had already been studied before 2011, but without assessing their virus inactivation effects. The first one was soluble CD4 (sCD4) (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Deen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">Traunecker et al., 1988</xref>). Theoretically, sCD4 could interact with the CD4bs in gp120 on HIV-1 and inactivate the cell-free virions in the absence of host cells because virions would lose their ability to bind with the cellular receptor CD4, making it impossible for them to enter the CD4 T cell for replication. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicated that sCD4 could inhibit HIV-1 infection with IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) values between 40 and 700 nM (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Daar et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Orloff et al., 1993</xref>). The results from phases I&#x02013;II clinical trials showed that intravenously administered sCD4 effectively reduced viral titers in sera without causing obvious toxicity. However, the half-life of sCD4 is short, leading to viral relapse within a short time after treatment (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Kahn et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Schooley et al., 1990</xref>). At low concentrations (&#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;g/ml or 20 nM), sCD4 could not effectively inhibit HIV-1 infection, but rather enhanced the infection of some HIV-1 clinical isolates in host cells, including some CD4- CCR5+ cells. This is because sCD4 binding to CD4bs in gp120 triggers the exposure of CoRbs in gp120 and NHR in gp41, facilitating the interaction between CoRbs in gp120 and the CCR5 coreceptor on the host cell and, hence, fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membrane (<xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al., 1998</xref>). Since CD4 is an important immune molecule that exerts its function through interaction with a number of human proteins, <italic>in vivo</italic> application of sCD4, an anti-HIV drug, may cause some adverse effects to the immune system. Therefore, development of sCD4 for clinical use has been discontinued, but the important information from the research on sCD4 has promoted studies of HIV inactivators containing part(s) of CD4 molecule.</p><p><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Allaway et al. (1995)</xref> constructed a fusion protein CD4-IgG2 comprised of human IgG2 in which the Fv portions of both heavy and light chains were replaced by D1D2 domains of CD4. They found that CD4-IgG2 bound gp120 with high affinity and was much more potent than sCD4 to inhibit HIV-1 fusion and infection. Unlike sCD4, CD4-IgG2 could not enhance HIV-1 infection in CD4- CCR5+ cells. Like the broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), IgG1b12, 2G12, and 2F5, CD4-IgG2 could effectively neutralize a panel of laboratory-adapted strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 with different subtypes with IC50s from 5 to 80 nM (<xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">Trkola et al., 1995</xref>), and it was capable of reducing viral titers in rodent models (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Gauduin et al., 1998</xref>). The results from clinical trials showed that CD4-IgG2 was well-tolerated at doses of 0.2&#x02013;10 mg/kg with a half-life of 3&#x02013;4 days <italic>in vivo</italic>, which was much longer than that of sCD4 (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et al., 2000</xref>). In advanced disease, an 80% response rate and &#x0223c;0.5 log10 mean reductions in viral load for 4&#x02013;6 weeks after treatment were mediated by CD4-IgG2 (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et al., 2004</xref>). However, the concern about the enhancement of infection of some HIV-1 strains caused by sCD4- or CD4-containing molecule, like CD4-IgG2, cannot be excluded since no such study has been reported so far.</p><p>According to the structural similarity between CD4&#x02019;s the CDR2-like loop in CD4 and scyllatoxin&#x02019;s the &#x003b2;-hairpin region of scyllatoxin, a short scorpion toxin, the side chains of nine residues in CD4 that are critical for, central in the gp120 binding to HIV-1 gp120, was transferred to the structurally homologous region in the scorpion toxin scaffold (<xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">Vita et al., 1999</xref>). The resulting miniprotein (27 residues), CD4M9 inhibited CD4 binding to gp120 with an IC50 of 40 &#x003bc;M and suppressed the infection of HIV-1 X4 and R5 strains with IC50s ranging from 0.4 to 5 &#x003bc;M. Subsequently, they designed bivalent and trivalent CD4-mimetic miniproteins based on CD4M9 and tested their antiviral activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.

They demonstrated that both CD4D1 and CD4PEP1 could interact with gp120 with KD values of 40 and 26 nM, respectively. However, their virus inhibition or inactivation activities have not been detected and reported. <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al.

Subsequently, they identified an mD1.2 mutant, mD1.22, which had higher thermostability, better solubility and stronger gp120-binding affinity compared to mD1.2. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that mD1.22 was several folds more potent than D1D2 and mD1.2 in inhibiting R5-tropic HIV-1 primary isolates, Bal and JRFL (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). To further improve its anti-HIV-1 activity and breadth, mD1.22 was fused with m36.4, an engineered human antibody domain targeting a CD4-induced (CD4i) epitope, which overlaps the HIV-1 coreceptor-binding site (CoRbs) on gp120 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). This resulted in the generation of two bispecific multivalent fusion proteins, 2Dm2m and 4Dm2m, which could inhibit infection by all HIV-1 strains tested, including 41 HIV-1 isolates circulating predominantly in China, with an average IC50 of 1.7 and 0.2 nM, respectively (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Most recently, the virus inactivation assay was utilized to compare the ability of 2Dm2m and 4Dm2m to inactivate cell-free HIV-1 IIIB virions against full-length sCD4, D1D2 (<xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), and mD1.22 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).

Therefore, 12p1 may act as an HIV-1 attachment inhibitor and/or inactivator. By optimizing the structure and activity of 12p1, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Chaiken and Rashad (2015)</xref> designed and synthesized a class of peptide triazoles which could simultaneously bind CD4bs and CoRbs on gp120 with higher affinity than that of 12p1, causing gp120 shedding from the viral particles, and thereby irreversibly inactivating the virions (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Aneja et al., 2015</xref>).

Influenza virus infection can lead to a high fever, cough, headache, sore throat etc. after 1&#x02013;3-day incubation period. Influenza viruses are classified as types A, B, C, and D, on the basis of antigenic properties of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M). Since most annual influenza epidemics in humans are caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Dou et al., 2018</xref>), we mainly discuss IAVs here. A vital challenge in combating IAVs is the constant evolution of the surface antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), to resist pressure from the host immune system, which is described as antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Therefore, IAVs are classified into subtypes based on the genetic and antigenic differences of HA and NA, including 18 subtypes of HA (H1&#x02013;H18) and 11 subtypes of NA (N1&#x02013;N11) (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Gamblin and Skehel, 2010</xref>).</p><p>At present, there are mainly two types of anti-influenza drugs used in clinics, including (1) M2 ion channel inhibitors, such as amantadine (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Bright et al., 2006</xref>) and rimantadine, which block viral uncoating, and (2) neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), including oseltamivir (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">de Jong et al., 2005</xref>), zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir octanoate, which inhibit viral release. However, the continual emergence of drug resistance seriously limits their effectiveness and clinical applications (<xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>). In 2018, a new antiviral drug, baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza), which can inhibit viral replication in cells, was approved by Japanese and United States FDA and proved effective against infection by influenza virus strains resistant to current anti-influenza drugs (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Ng, 2019</xref>).

Also, these drugs mentioned above must inhibit viral infection in the presence of target cells, instead of inactivating cell-free influenza virions.</p><p>As mentioned above, two envelope glycoproteins, HA and NA, are on the surface of the influenza virion. HA is originally translated as the HA0 precursor, about 560 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Subsequently, it undergoes proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation to form a heterodimerized trimer composed of three HA1 and three HA2 subunits, and approximately 350&#x02013;400 trimers are found on the surface of a virion (<xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">Skehel and Wiley, 2000</xref>). On the surface of HA1 globular head, it is the RBS (residues 116&#x02013;261), composed of a &#x003b2;-barrel motif and &#x003b1;-helices, which resembles a shallow pocket. The key receptor binding residues are highly conserved among different HA subtypes (<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Priyadarzini et al., 2012</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, to initiate the entry process, the RBS on HA attaches the virus to cell surface receptors that contain terminal sialic-acid residues, which triggers the virion entering an endosome via endocytosis (<xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Whittaker, 2013</xref>). The acidic environment in the endosome induces conformational change of HA, enabling the exposure of the fusion peptide on the N-terminus of HA2.

They found that these peptides could also bind H1 and H3 HAs and that the binding could be inhibited in the presence of sialic acid. Plaque assays indicated that one of these peptides, C18-LVRPLAL, could strongly inhibit infection by the A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) strain with an IC50 value of 6.4 &#x003bc;M.

Although HA protein itself does not belong to the range of inactivators we discuss here for not acting on cell-free virions, it can function through other two ways. It can be the possible receptor antagonist, which binds to the cell receptor to inhibit viral infection.

A previous study reported the existence of a hydrophobic pocket between domain I and II, which acted as a hinge of the E protein structural rearrangement and could interact with the detergent &#x003b2;-<italic>N</italic>-octyl-glucoside (<xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Modis et al., 2003</xref>). By molecular docking analysis, <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Panya et al. (2014)</xref> identified several short peptides targeting the hydrophobic pocket. They found that the dipeptide Glu-Phe (EF for short) could inhibit the infection of all four DENV serotypes, but it was the most effective against DENV-2 with an IC50 value of 96 &#x003bc;M. Different inhibitory effect for the four serotypes of DENV was possible because of the different amino acid sequence of their hydrophobic pockets. Inferred from its mechanism of action, EF peptide can be considered as a DENV inactivator, as potentially confirmed by performing a virus inactivation assay. In addition, the lateral loop of domain III has been verified to play an important role in virus-cell receptor interaction, thus making it another feasible target of protein- and peptide-based DENV inactivators (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Hung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Mazumder et al., 2007</xref>). Using the BioMoDroid algorithm, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alhoot et al. (2013)</xref> screened for anti-DENV peptides targeting a short sequence (residues 380&#x02013;389) in the lateral loop of DENV-2 E protein domain III. They found that peptides DET2 and DET4 could inhibit DENV-2 infection with IC50 values of 500 and 35 &#x003bc;M, respectively. Observed with transmission electron microscopy, the surface of virions was found to become irregular and have rough edges, suggesting that these peptides could inactivate virions by disrupting integrity of the viral envelope.</p><p>Other studies showed that M protein of DENV could interact with native E protein to trigger the conformation of DENV E protein, suggesting that peptides derived from M protein may act as DENV inactivators. <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Panya et al. (2015)</xref> designed a novel anti-DENV peptide, MLH40, derived from the conserved ectodomain of M protein, and found that it could inhibit infection of four serotypes of DENV with IC50 values ranging from 24 to 31 &#x003bc;M. Molecular docking analysis suggested that the N-terminal loop of MLH40 could interact with DENV E protein to alter its native dimeric conformation. However, its inactivation activity has not been tested and reported.</p><p>In sum, the studies on DENV and ZIKV inactivators are not as comprehensive as those on HIV inactivators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Almost all of them are peptides, not proteins; some important targets including the RBS in domain III have not been utilized adequately like CD4bs in HIV gp120 (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Huerta et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the viral inactivation activities of many peptides have not been verified with the virus inactivation assay, and specific targets and action mechanisms of most peptide-based inactivators have not been clearly elucidated. Despite of these deficiencies, the design and development of DENV and ZIKV inactivators can be referential paradigms for those of newly emerging or re-emerging viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S1.SS4"><title>Protein- and Peptide-Based HSV Inactivators</title><p>Herpesviruses, a large and diverse family of enveloped viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes, can bring about lifelong, latent infections (<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Pellet and Roizman, 2013</xref>). These viruses are classified as three subfamilies, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-, on the basis of their genome sequences and biological properties (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Davison et al., 2009</xref>). In alpha-herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are human pathogens, which routinely infect humans (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Roizman et al., 2013</xref>). HSV, among the most widespread pathogenic agents in the human population, causes varieties of diseases, ranging from oral and genital ulcers to devastating encephalitis. Following the initial infection at a peripheral site, it will establish a lifetime latency in sensory neurons, which can be reactivated by some internal or external stimuli, including fever, immunosuppression, trauma, etc. (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Roizman et al., 2013</xref>). So far, three categories of drugs have got approval for the treatment of HSV infection, including (1) the nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir (ACV), (2) the acyclic nucleotide analog cidofovir and (3) the pyrophosphate analog foscarnet (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Kimberlin and Whitley, 2007</xref>). Till now, ACV remains the prototypic antiviral agent and the reference for treating HSV infection. However, viral resistance to ACV has become a critical clinical problem, especially concerning immunocompromised patients undergoing long-term therapy (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Englund et al., 1990</xref>). Although the other two drugs also have been proven to be effective for treating HSV infection, they are reserved for confirmed cases of ACV resistance due to their nephrotoxicity (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Galdiero et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, these drugs all exert antiviral effects by targeting viral DNA polymerase in target cells, therefore no antiviral drugs targeting HSV entry are available currently, let alone inactivating virions (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Galdiero et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Different from most of other enveloped viruses using a single Env to mediate viral fusion process, HSV utilize a set of surface glycoproteins including gD, gH/gL, and gB as the core fusion components. Therein gD acts as the receptor-binding protein, gH/gL as the fusion regulator and gB as the class III fusogen (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Heldwein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Arii and Kawaguchi, 2018</xref>). Taking HSV-1 as the example, HSV-1 gD (369-amino acids) is a type I membrane glycoprotein with a short cytoplasmic tail and an ectodomain with an immunoglobulin-like core flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Carfi et al., 2001</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, HSV-1 gH is an 838-amino acid type I membrane glycoprotein comprised of a single pass transmembrane domain, a short cytoplasmic tail and an ectodomain (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Gompels and Minson, 1986</xref>). Its ectodomain can be subdivided into domains H1 (H1A and H1B), H2 and H3, and the N-terminal H1 domain binds gL to form a non-covalent heterodimer (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Gompels and Minson, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Chowdary et al., 2010</xref>). Results showed the crystal structure of gH/gL complex does not resemble any other known viral fusogen structure. Therefore, the gB-gH/gL complex is key for fusion and can be inhibited by neutralizing antibody to gH, implying that the gH/gL complex activates gB through direct binding (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Chowdary et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study confirmed the C-terminal domain H3 of HSV-1 is important for interaction with gB (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Bohm et al., 2016</xref>). HSV-1 gB, is a 904-amino acid glycoprotein with an extended rodlike ectodomain, transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The ectodomain has five distinct parts, domains I&#x02013;V, and domain IV is fully exposed with neutralizing epitopes on it and possibly interacts with cellular receptors (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Heldwein et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>The structures of HSV gH and gB protein in the native and fusion-intermediate states, which serve as sources of protein- and peptide-based HSV inactivators. <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic representation of HSV-1 gH and gB composition. gH is composed of the ectodomain (H1, H2, and H3 domains, colored mazarine blue, green, and yellow, respectively), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CP). gB is composed of domains I&#x02013;V, transmembrane region (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP). <bold>(B)</bold> The HSV entry process orchestrated by a set of glycoproteins, including receptor-binding gD, fusion-regulating gH/gL and the fusogen gB. gD binding to either receptor, such as HVEM and nectin-1, causes its conformational change to expose the profusion domain. gB may also bind to specific cell receptors, such as (PILR)&#x003b1; and NMHC-II. Meanwhile, gH/gL may be facilitated by the activated form of gD to convert into a form able to interact with gB, triggering the transformation of the prefusion form of gB into a fusogenic state. Next, Akt (protein kinase B) may be triggered to translocate to the outer leaflet microdomains of the plasma membrane to interact with gB, which further induces Akt phosphorylation and intracellular calcium release. Subsequently gB inserts the fusion loop into the target cell membrane to form the extended, trimeric intermediate, which allows fusion of the two membranes.

HSV entry through direct fusion is a coordinated process that involves a cascade of events, which can be briefly divided into (1) binding to specific cell receptors, (2) intracellular signaling, and (3) fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membrane (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Connolly et al., 2011</xref>). At the beginning of entry process, binding of glycoprotein D to one of its cognate receptors is significant. Four gD receptors of HSV-1 and HSV-2 have been confirmed: a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM); the poliovirus receptor family, including nectin-1 and nectin-2, belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; and a modified form of heparan sulfate, 3-<italic>O</italic>-sulfated heparan sulfate, 3-<italic>O</italic>-HS (<xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Weed and Nicola, 2017</xref>).

The peptides gB94 (residues 496&#x02013;510) and gB122 (residues 636&#x02013;650) could inactivate cell-free virions with EC50 of 125 and 138 &#x003bc;M, respectively, although their detailed mechanism of action has not been reported. However, while peptide gB131 (residues 681&#x02013;695) exhibited no virus inactivation, it did show inhibitory activity (IC50: &#x0223c;12 &#x003bc;M). More recently, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Cetina-Corona et al. (2016)</xref> created a library of continuous 15-25 residue stretches (CRSs) located on the surface of HSV-2 gH and HSV-1 gB through bioinformatics analysis. According to the flexibility, charged residues and conservatism of the CRS sequence, they selected and synthesized peptides CB-1 and CB-2 derived from gH and peptides U-1 and U-2 derived from gB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Results showed that peptides U-1 and U-2 at 100 &#x003bc;M could inactivate more than 80% of HSV-1 and HSV-2 virions, while peptides CB-1 and CB-2 at 100 &#x003bc;M could only inactivate less than 50% of these virions. However, the detailed mechanism of action showing how these peptides inactivate cell-free HSV virions has not been clarified. Meanwhile, the viral inactivation activities of these peptide inactivators are relatively weak, requiring further optimization.</p><p>As mentioned above, the fusion process is mediated by a set of interactions between gD, gH/gL, and gB, and between these glycoproteins and their receptors (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Azab and Osterrieder, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Weed and Nicola, 2017</xref>), thus multiple glycoprotein or RBSs are potential to be targets of HSV inactivators. Taking the potent gH/gL-specific neutralizing antibody as the example, it could inhibit the formation of the gB-gH/gL complex, suggesting that the gB binding site in gH/gL may locate in the vicinity of the neutralizing epitope (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Chowdary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Bohm et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the neutralizing epitope in gH/gL may serve as one of the targets. Similarly, glycoprotein-binding sites or RBSs on gD (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Di Giovine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Cairns et al., 2019</xref>) also prompt the design of HSV inactivators, just like the CD4bs in HIV gp120. Therefore, more comprehensive studies on the crystal structures of these glycoproteins and the mechanism of the fusion process are essential for the design of protein- and peptide-based HSV inactivators.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Discussion</title><p>The lower eukaryotic organisms, such as invertebrates and plants, only possess the innate immunity system, including some antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that can non-specifically destroy the viral envelope and inactivate the cell-free virions (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Ganz, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2012</xref>). After long evolution, higher vertebrates have gained an advanced adaptive immune system that can specifically attack and inactivate pathogenic viruses. Neutralizing antibodies are a vital component of the adaptive immune system. According to our definition of virus inactivators described before, many of the viral neutralizing antibodies with the ability to irreversibly inactivate cell-free virions can be considered as protein-based virus inactivators. The development of neutralizing antibodies during the evolutionary process may also reflect the fact that protein-based virus inactivators able to actively attack and inactivate cell-free virions have certain advantages against viral infections (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Burton, 2002</xref>). Nonetheless, how these neutralizing antibodies inactivate cell-free virions is still unclear, and for this reason, they were not discussed in detail in this review.</p><p>Viral fusion proteins in different oligomeric states and structures can be classified into three different classes (classes I, II, and III) (<xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Weissenhorn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Harrison, 2008</xref>). Here we reviewed the development of PPVIs against the following representative enveloped viruses: HIV and influenza virus (with class I membrane fusion), ZIKV and DENV (with class II membrane fusion), and HSV (with class III membrane fusion). Although their fusion/entry processes vary from each other, some common technologies can be used for identifying or designing and evaluating PPVIs, including those (1) for constructing recombinant fusion proteins, such as those applied to design the potent protein-based HIV-1 inactivators 2DLT and 2Dm2m (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>); (2) for constructing phage display peptide libraries, such as the one utilized to screen for the peptide 12p1, from which the peptide-based HIV-1 inactivator Triazole KR13 was designed (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Bastian et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>); (3) for performing computer-aided design of proteins or peptides targeting the RBS, such as the CD4bs in HIV-1 gp120 and sialic-acid binding site in influenza virus HA1, or the conserved stem regions, such as those in DENV and ZIKV E protein; and (4) for performing viral inactivation assays, such as those for evaluating inactivation activities of the PPVIs against HIV-1 and ZIKV (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). In general, these techniques and strategies have been successfully applied to design a variety of virus inactivators targeting viral Envs, and they can also be used for the design of virus inactivators against other enveloped viruses, particularly the newly emerging and re-emerging viruses with potential to cause global pandemics (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Summary of protein- and peptide-based virus inactivators.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Name</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sequence</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Target</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EC50* (virus tested)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reference</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><bold>HIV inactivators</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sCD4</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Extracellular D1&#x02013;D4 or D1D2 domain</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">gp120 CD4bs</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">153 and 297 nM (HIV-1 IIIB and Bal, respectively)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Deen et al., 1988</xref>;

CD4bs, CD4-binding site; CoRbs, coreceptor-binding site.</italic></attrib></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Moreover, by learning from the design strategies of inactivators against enveloped viruses, we can now design and develop viral inactivators targeting key proteins involved in the entry process of non-enveloped viruses. The entry process of a non-enveloped virion is initiated by binding of the viral capsid protein to the cell receptor, followed by entry of the virion into endosomes in the host cell through clathrin- or caveolae-mediated endocytosis or macropinocytosis. The low pH environment causes conformational change of the virus capsid, leading to the externalization of membrane-penetrating peptides (MPPs) in endosomal compartments. Finally, MPPs are integrated or associated with endosomal membranes, leading to distortion and disruption of the membrane and allowing the release of nucleocapsid or genome into the cytosol (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Considering that most complicated fusion steps occur in the cell endosome, the receptor-binding domains in the viral capsid protein seem to be the best targets for design of PPVIs against non-enveloped viruses. However, the structure and function of the receptor-binding domains in their capsid proteins have not been well studied (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Day and Schelhaas, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the design of virus inactivators against non-enveloped viruses still has a long way to go.</p><p>At present, development of PPVIs has become a topic of strong interest in the field of antiviral drugs. Different from &#x0201c;passive defenders,&#x0201d; and fusion inhibitors and receptor antagonists in &#x0201c;gate keepers,&#x0201d; protein- and peptide-based inactivators have been found to actively attack and inactivate cell-free virions anywhere they meet in the blood by specifically interacting with one or more sites in Env on the virion, thus they are expected to have higher utilization rate than the current antiviral drugs. The action mechanisms of PPVIs include (1) blocking the RBS on viral Envs, (2) inducing conformational changes of viral Env, causing the virion to lose the ability to enter the host cell, or (3) binding to the Env stem or the viral lipid membrane, to disrupt the integrity of the viral envelope or lead to the release of viral genetic materials. Apart from these, exact mechanisms of some PPVIs still remain to be explored.</p><p>In general, protein and peptide drugs are safer for humans than small-molecule chemical drugs because these big molecules do not enter the host cells, thus having no adverse effect on the functions of intracellular proteins. However, the effect of long-term use of PPVIs, especially those mimicking human proteins, such as the CD4 receptor, on the normal function of human body are still unknown, since many of these drug candidates have not been tested in clinics. To solve this problem, maybe we can design binding analogs of human proteins, like CD4M9 (<xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">Vita et al., 1999</xref>), or only select the core domain of natural structures, like mD1.22 mentioned above (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Another potential problem is the immunogenicity of the protein- and peptide-based inactivators. After long-term use in humans, these exogenous proteins and peptides may induce specific antibodies against them, which may attenuate their inactivation activities. Therefore, immunogenicity of these drug candidates to humans should be assessed and reduced before further development. In recent years, strategies to remove the immunogenicity of the protein-based drug candidates are increasingly diverse and mature. In fact, they mainly focus on the T-cell epitope of the candidate, since T cell plays a key role in activating B cells to transform into antibody-producing plasma cells (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Moise et al., 2016</xref>) and the linear T-cell epitope is more prone to predict than the steric B-cell epitope. One method adopted widely is to calculate the T-cell epitope with a forecasting software, such as Epimatrix developed by EpiVax Inc. (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">De Groot et al., 2008</xref>), validate the T-cell epitope with experiments (such as T-cell proliferation assay) and mutate its amino-acid sequence to remove the immunogenicity (<xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Besides these two disadvantages, compared with chemical-based virus inactivators, PPVIs usually have a shorter half-life and lack oral availability thus require several times of injection a week. In terms of their higher production cost, PPVIs are generally more expensive for long-term treatment of chronic viral infection. Lentiviral vector-based gene therapy to secret a PPVI continuously can be one choice to lower the cost (<xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Perez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Egerer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Falkenhagen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For example, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Falkenhagen et al. (2014)</xref> designed lentiviral vectors encoding secreted anti-HIV proteins including sCD4, which could prohibit the infection of both gene-modified and unmodified cells. They further investigated the <italic>in vivo</italic> application of this approach by injecting gene-modified hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) into humanized mice. The results demonstrated a reduction of viral load over time in humanized mice capable of secreting sCD4, upon challenge with HIV (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Falkenhagen et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, continuous delivery of secreted PPVIs via gene therapy is also a potential way apart from oral administration of chemical-based virus inactivators or frequent injection of PPVIs.</p><p>In particular, the disadvantages of PPVIs mentioned above may not be the problems for the urgent treatment of the highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging virus infections, e.g., Ebola virus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Drugs are especially key in the first aid, when several days later, protective antibodies are produced in the body to combat viruses, but lives may be taken away at any time (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Baseler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Mubarak et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, characteristics of medication against these viral infections are short-term use (1&#x02013;3 weeks), rapid application and high safety for the infirm patients, therefore the cost may not be a problem to consider. Besides, the need of rapid application parallels to the injection requirement of PPVIs, which takes effect faster than oral administration. Also, protein-based drugs are intrinsically safe (<xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Zaman et al., 2019</xref>), and in this circumstance, their short half-lives become an advantage instead because they will not accumulate in the body. In sum, PPVIs may be a good choice when facing the pandemic of the highly pathogenic newly emerging and re-emerging viruses.</p><p>Nowadays, a variety of protein and peptide drugs, including antibody drugs, have been approved for clinical use. Because of their advantages mentioned above, we believe that more and more PPVIs will be developed for treatment and prevention of viral infections, particularly useful for combating the pandemics or epidemics of newly emerging and re-emerging virus infections.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>YW organized the manuscript.
