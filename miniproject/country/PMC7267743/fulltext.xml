In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and at the time of writing this review, just over three million individuals have been infected with more than 200,000 deaths globally. Numerous countries are in &#x02018;lockdown&#x02019;, social distancing is the new norm, even the most advanced healthcare systems are under pressure, and a global economic recession seems inevitable. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the aetiological agent. From experience with previous coronavirus epidemics, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2004 and 2012 respectively, it was postulated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor is a possible port of cell entry. ACE2 is part of the renin-angiotensin system and is also associated with lung and cardiovascular disorders and inflammation. Recent studies have confirmed that ACE2 is the port of entry for SARS-CoV-2. Male sex, advanced age and a number of associated comorbidities have been identified as risk factors for infection with COVID-19. Many high-risk COVID-19 patients with comorbidities are on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, and this has sparked debate about whether to continue these treatment regimes. Attention has also shifted to ACE2 being a target for future therapies or vaccines against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss COVID-19 and its complex relationship with ACE2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>angiotensin-converting enzyme 2</kwd><kwd>renin-angiotensin system</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-0004563220928361"><title>Introduction</title><p>In these unprecedented times, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a severe impact globally.

This is the seventh member of the coronavirus family. Of the six previously described CoVs, four cause no more than minimal common cold symptoms in humans. The other two members are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</p><p>All CoVs have zoonotic origins, with bats considered the natural reservoir hosts.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In SARS-CoV-2, the sequence identity of pangolin origin CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is 99%, and this raised the question whether the virus is of pangolin origin.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The natural hosts, namely bats, have a limited inflammatory response as seen by lower interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; concentrations and adequate type I interferons, giving rise to a generalized anti-inflammatory milieu and an ability to limit excessive inflammatory response.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Interestingly, this may also explain bats&#x02019; relatively long lifespan of 30&#x02013;40&#x02009;years.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Type I interferon is known to assist with antiviral control.

The median age of 49&#x02009;years (there were no adolescents or children), 73% were male and 66% had exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market. Of this cohort, 13 (32%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Lymphopaenia, increased D-dimer levels, increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased high-sensitivity troponin-I (hs-TnI) and increased inflammatory cytokines indicated poor prognosis and outcome.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Another early study described 99 hospitalized cases in Wuhan. The average age was 55&#x02009;years, most were male and 49% had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. Age, obesity and comorbid illness were associated with increased mortality, and concern was expressed about individuals with compromised immune function such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), increased age, diabetics or those on immunosuppressive therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>A subsequent study of six family members in Shenzhen China who had returned from a visit to Wuhan described the first person-to-person transmission of the virus.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Yang et&#x000a0;al. described the clinical course and outcomes in 710 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 52 who were critically ill. In the critically ill, the mean age was 59.7&#x02009;years, 67% were male, 40% had comorbidities and 61.5% had died at 28&#x02009;days (median time seven&#x02009;days).

The median age was 59&#x02009;years and 56% were male. As 55% of cases were linked to the original Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, this was evident of human-to-human transmission. They described a doubling of cases every 7.4&#x02009;days and suggested a 14-day observation or quarantine period for exposed persons. They described that each infected person spread the virus to an average of 2.2 people they come in contact with.

Increased risk of in-hospital death was associated with older age, organ failure and raised D-dimer levels, and the authors postulated that these could possibly be used on admission to identify patients with a worse prognosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Wang et&#x000a0;al. examined the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data on 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Older age, comorbidities and abnormal laboratory tests including lymphopaenia, increased D-dimer, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prolonged PTT were associated with a worse prognosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Liu et&#x000a0;al. performed a small study on only 12 patients in Shenzhen China, of which eight were males and seven were older than 60&#x02009;years. They found that laboratory parameters associated with worse prognosis were decreased albumin concentrations, lymphopaenia and elevated CRP and LDH concentrations. They measured angiotensin II concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found them to be increased. This increased angiotensin II was associated with a high viral load and lung injury suggesting an imbalanced renin angiotensin system (RAS). The authors therefore questioned the possible utility of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as possible treatment modalities.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>The first case diagnosed in USA on 20 January 2020 was a young male patient who had travelled to Wuhan, China.

Recombinant ACE2 was found to normalize angiotensin II concentrations, suggesting that it may be beneficial to prevent organ damage caused by SARS-CoV.

Angiotensin II, a novel vasopressor agent, may be beneficial in this patient population.</p><p>Strategies to decrease ACE2 may possibly attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This may happen in a number of ways. Firstly, endogenous angiotensin II theoretically prevents infection by binding the ACE2 during its degradation and therefore may compete with SARS-CoV-2 to bind to the receptor. Secondly, binding of angiotensin II to AT1 causes internalization and downregulation of ACE2. And lastly, angiotensin II causes AT1-dependent destruction of ACE2 further decreasing the virus&#x02019; ability to enter cells. Angiotensin II is not yet available for use commercially, but due to the number of critically ill patients, and the promising outcome of the drug, it has been made available for compassionate use in Italy, Germany and UK.<sup><xref rid="bibr61-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec19-0004563220928361"><title>Angiotensin (1&#x02013;7)</title><p>Another focus area is the use of angiotensin (1&#x02013;7) as a novel treatment for COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Experimental studies found that angiotensin (1&#x02013;7) reduced the acute inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis in acid-induced ARDS in mice.<sup><xref rid="bibr62-0004563220928361" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> Angiotensin (1&#x02013;7) protected the lung against inflammation and fibrosis, inhibited alveolar cell apoptosis, attenuated endothelial cell activation, loss of barrier function and oedema, and decreased synthesis of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines.
