Sporadic outbreaks of YFV occur in endemic tropical regions, causing a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) associated with high mortality rates. Despite a highly effective vaccine, no antiviral treatments currently exist. Therefore, YFV represents a neglected tropical disease and is chronically understudied, with many aspects of YFV biology incompletely defined including host range, host&#x02013;virus interactions and correlates of host immunity and pathogenicity. In this article, we review the current state of YFV research, focusing on the viral lifecycle, host responses to infection, species tropism and the success and associated limitations of the YFV-17D vaccine. In addition, we highlight the current lack of available treatments and use publicly available sequence and structural data to assess global patterns of YFV sequence diversity and identify potential drug targets. Finally, we discuss how technological advances, including real-time epidemiological monitoring of outbreaks using next-generation sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 modification of vector species, could be utilized in future battles against this re-emerging pathogen which continues to cause devastating disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>yellow fever virus</kwd><kwd>flavivirus entry factor</kwd><kwd>global diversity</kwd><kwd>yellow fever virus tropism</kwd><kwd>animal models</kwd><kwd>transmission and vector control</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>host immune response</kwd><kwd>E protein structure</kwd><kwd>re-emerging virus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-viruses-11-00960"><title>1. General Introduction</title><p>Yellow fever was historically the first described viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) and its causative agent, the yellow fever virus (YFV), is the prototypic member of the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. Pioneering experimental work in the 19th century identified the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitos as the vector responsible for transmission to humans, facilitating subsequent eradication from Europe and North America [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, today, YFV remains prevalent in tropical regions of Africa and South America [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], with over 900 million people currently living in endemic areas, 500 million of whom reside in Africa [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. YFV represents a zoonotic pathogen and complete eradication in tropical regions is not achievable due to rainforest circulation in primate reservoirs [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A highly effective live-attenuated vaccine, the 17D strain, was developed in the 1930s and still in use today, over 80 years later [<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Indeed, vaccination represents one of the core strategies employed to stop YFV outbreaks or minimize their impact when they do occur [<xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> is a diverse group of small enveloped viruses representing over 100 species [<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Viral genomes from <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> members are non-segmented positive-stranded RNAs ranging from ~9 to ~13 kb in length, and phylogenetic analyses of 125 family members revealed four well-supported genera: <italic>Pestivirus</italic>, <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>, <italic>Pegivirus</italic> and <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f001">Figure 1</xref> and [<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> which cause a significant disease burden in humans are highlighted on the tree presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Genome organization and cytoplasmic replication on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes are conserved between divergent <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> members. However, host-range, tissue-tropism, pathogenicity and modes of transmission can differ greatly [<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. YFV is a member of the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus, which is composed of arboviruses exhibiting broad host ranges which can be transmitted to humans from animal reservoirs via insect vectors. This genus contains a number of important human pathogens which can cause acute infections, including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Transmission is mediated via mosquito vectors and infection of humans can cause a range of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to encephalitis (WNV, JEV and ZIKV) or fatal hemorrhagic fever (YFV and DENV).</p><p>YFV continues to pose a very real threat to public health, which has been starkly illustrated by recent outbreaks in Angola in 2015&#x02013;2016 [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Brazil in 2016&#x02013;2017 [<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and associated imports into non-endemic regions [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is compounded by a limited vaccine production, which can easily be overwhelmed by a large YFV outbreak, and the collapse of vector control programs [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], coupled with large populations of unvaccinated individuals in endemic regions and a lack of effective antivirals for treatment of infected patients [<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, despite long-standing knowledge of YFVs genomic architecture, favorable growth kinetics in tissue culture and the availability of reverse genetic systems [<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], YFV remains a neglected tropical disease attracting relatively little research attention [<xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is, in part, due to vaccine availability, which has led to research complacency [<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and recent commentaries have highlighted the need for intensification of YFV research, as many facets of the virus life cycle remain poorly defined [<xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These include determination of vertebrate and arthropod host-ranges, identification of co-opted host factors which are essential for YFV propagation in humans and insects, and identification of genetic markers and associated mechanisms underlying differential pathogenesis and observed clinical outcomes in infected humans.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-11-00960"><title>2. Clinical Outcomes and Potential Therapeutic Options</title><p>Infection with YFV has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from entirely asymptomatic to hemorrhagic fever associated with high mortality rates. Indeed, estimates indicate only one symptomatic case for every 7&#x02013;12 cases that remain clinically silent [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the majority of symptomatic cases, YFV infection is a self-limiting disease with abrupt onset of fever and pain (predominantly myalgia, lumbosacral pain and headache with associated conjunctival injection) that occurs after an incubation period of 3&#x02013;6 days. In this phase, YFV infection is difficult to diagnose, as symptoms are unspecific. The duration of fever is approximately three days, during which the patient is usually viremic [<xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Laboratory abnormalities during this &#x0201c;period of infection&#x0201d; include elevated liver enzymes, leukopenia and proteinuria. A phase of improvement, lasting up to two days, can be interposed but does not occur in all cases. In around 15% of patients, the disease progresses to a &#x0201c;toxic phase&#x0201d;, which is characterized by the return of fever, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain and renal insufficiency [<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is characterized by systemic viscerotropic disease and liver injury is a hallmark of this phase [<xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], leading to jaundice and contributing to bleeding diathesis, which may lead to more severe hemorrhaging. It is not well understood why this phase occurs in some patients although host adaptive immune responses are believed to contribute to the severity [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in addition to underlying genetic factors which predispose Caucasians to a higher mortality rate [<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The case fatality rate of hospitalized patients ranges between 25% and 50% and is correspondingly higher in South America compared to Africa [<xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Mortality rates may depend on the virulence of the infecting strain, as well as the underlying intrinsic immunity and genetic factors of the exposed population. In addition, cross-immunity to other flaviviruses, such as DENV, is believed to reduce the severity of YFV infections [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Patients who survive the disease may suffer from fatigue and may have elevated liver enzymes for extended periods of time [<xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Vaccination campaigns represent the only current approach to control and prevent the spread of YFV in endemic regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-viruses-11-00960">Section 6</xref>). Indeed, despite the long history of humankind being afflicted by YFV and the large populations in tropical Africa and Central and South America at risk of potentially catastrophic epidemics, today, treatment options for infected individuals are limited to relief of symptoms and intensive care support of patients with severe disease. Presently, no specific licensed treatment options for YFV-associated severe disease are available. As development of new drugs is expensive and time-consuming, one potential option includes repurposing drugs already licensed for other diseases. This includes drugs targeted at other members of the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, most prominently hepatitis C virus (HCV) and DENV. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, in combination with pegylated interferon-&#x003b1; (PEG IFN-&#x003b1;), is effective for the treatment of HCV, a related member of the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f001">Figure 1</xref>), as well as a variety of other RNA and DNA viruses. In vitro studies and mouse models yielded promising results against YFV, but these results could not be replicated in non-human primates [<xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. More recently, considerable efforts have been invested in the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) against HCV and DENV. Sofosbuvir, a DAA licensed for use against HCV, is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of the viral RdRp NS5B. It also has described antiviral activity against the related flaviviruses, ZIKV [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and DENV [<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Computer modelling and in vitro experiments in hepatoma cell lines demonstrated sofosbuvir&#x02019;s inhibitory effects on YFV replication: in a mouse model, sofosbuvir was able to decrease mortality and weight loss associated with liver injury, however, only in the case of pre-exposure treatment [<xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A varying efficacy against YFV has also been demonstrated for other compounds targeting the NS5 RdRp [<xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the NS3 helicase [<xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and capsid protein [<xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Screening compound libraries via high-throughput in vitro approaches were successful at identifying additional compounds with in-vitro activity against YFV. Patkar et al. (2009) identified two compounds with proposed activity against the NS4B protein [<xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and Guo et al. (2016) were able to successfully apply a benzodiazepine compound (BDAA) in a hamster model of YFV infection, where it protected 90% of animals from death via targeting of NS4B [<xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Using RNA interference (RNAi) technology, shRNAs (short hairpin RNAs) targeted at the YFV E and NS1 regions were effective in inhibiting YFV replication in cell lines as well as improving survival in mice when injected intracerebrally prior to exposure to the YFV-17D strain [<xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, for all the approaches outlined above, demonstration of efficacy in humans or non-human primates remains outstanding.</p><p>The host immune response is a believed to contribute to the severity of the &#x0201c;toxic phase&#x0201d;, but approaches targeting the host&#x02019;s immune response in severe YFV disease are lacking. When patients present with severe symptoms, the therapeutic window of IFNs and other immune modulators may have already passed [<xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The potential benefits of corticosteroids [<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or the therapeutic application of anti-YFV antibodies [<xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot1-viruses-11-00960">Section 3.1</xref>) have not been evaluated but represent promising avenues for further investigation. In summary, many potential candidates for treatment of YFV-induced symptoms have been identified, although none are currently licensed. The toxicity and efficacy of promising anti-YFV therapeutics should be further investigated in animal studies and clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-viruses-11-00960"><title>3. The Replication Cycle of YFV</title><p>The replication cycle of YFV is defined by multiple distinct stages, which are shared between divergent members of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. These include (a) attachment of the viral particle to target cells, (b) interaction with surface receptors for internalization, (c) fusion of viral and endosomal membranes and release of the nucleocapsid into cytoplasm, (d) disintegration of the nucleocapsid, (e) translation and replication of the viral genome, (f) assembly and maturation of viral particles and (g) release of nascent virions [<xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Currently, many of these stages are poorly defined for YFV, especially with respect to identification of co-opted host factors, which are essential at every stage of the life cycle. Additionally, how these processes differ between mosquitos and humans requires further investigation.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-viruses-11-00960"><title>3.1. YFV Virion Composition and E Protein Functions</title><p>The YFV virion is spherical in shape, with a 40&#x02013;60 nm diameter [<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The virion is composed of host-hijacked lipid membranes associated with three virally encoded structural proteins. These include the highly basic core protein (C) which binds and encapsidates the YFV RNA genome [<xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and two envelope glycoproteins: prM/M (membrane) and E (envelope). The transmembrane domains of prM and E act as membrane anchors and also represent ER retention signals [<xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The E protein of YFV represents a class II fusion protein, which possesses structural homology with the ectodomains of the envelope proteins from divergent arboviruses (related flaviviruses and unrelated alphaviruses), despite no obvious amino acid conservation [<xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The E protein facilitates YFV entry into permissive cells, mediating the interaction between the virus and cell surface receptors, and also elicits host neutralizing antibody responses. YFV E consists of three domains: DI, DII and DIII (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, upper panel). In the pre-fusion state, the E protein forms dimeric structures. DII contains a highly conserved 16 amino acid fusion peptide motif (DRGWGNGCGLFGKGSI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>, highlighted pink) [<xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and can be found in a parallel orientation to the virion&#x02019;s lipid envelope in the pre-fusion state (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, lower panel). DIII harbors epitopes essential for neutralization of YFV [<xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, antibody repertoire cloning from YFV patients also identified key neutralizing epitope residues in domains I (residue 71) and II (residues 153-5), which likely combine to form a conformational epitope [<xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>The potent anti-E monoclonal antibody 5A identified in [<xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] was able to neutralize divergent YFV strains (YFV-17D and Angola lineage) [<xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The mAb 5A recognizes a conserved region within DII, which is accessible in both the pre- and post-fusion states of the virus. It is suggested that mAb 5A interferes at three stages during YFV infection: (A) by inhibition of virus attachment due to modifying the spatial distance between the E protein and host receptors; (B) by entering early endosomes and inhibiting the &#x0201c;dimer-to-trimer transition&#x0201d; of the E protein by blocking membrane fusion and therefore, blocking the release of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm and; (C) by binding the E protein trimers in their post-fusion state [<xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Structural and functional studies have suggested conformational change from a dimeric to a trimeric state, which is induced by acidification of endosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) and leads to a release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm via E protein-mediated fusion of virus and endosomal membranes [<xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

By facilitating virus entry into target cells and determining the global structure of the virion, the YFV E is essential for infection. Thus, it represents an ideal target for an intervention at an early state of infection, e.g., using a structure-based drug design or E-targeted monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies [<xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Antiviral mAbs represent viable therapeutic options, including palivizumab (marketed as Synagis), which is licensed for use against RSV in humans [<xref rid="B60-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and a number of anti-HIV mAbs in clinical trials [<xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].

The transmembrane immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) and TAM (Tyro3, Axl and Mer) families of phosphatidylserine receptors have been shown to mediate DENV infection, with TIM-1 and TIM-4 also enhancing infection rates for WNV and YFV-17D to differing degrees, while herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection rates were unaffected [<xref rid="B67-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Therefore, these cellular factors represent general enhancers of flavivirus infection. Additionally, candidates implicated in YFV host-cell attachment include heparin sulfate, a member of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family, which also facilitates attachment for the related flaviviruses DENV [<xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) [<xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], as well as unrelated viruses, including HSV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].

Thus, distinct flaviviruses may use conserved entry factor(s) for entry into permissive cells in mosquito vector species.</p><p>Divergent entry mechanisms have been observed for even closely related YFV strains. The parental Asibi strain and the derived YFV-17D vaccine strain both infect permissive cells by a pH-dependent fusion mechanism, although these related viruses enter via distinct routes [<xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Both strains enter in a dynamin-2 dependent fashion and traffic through Rab5- and Rab11-positive early and recycling endosomes. However, the wild-type Asibi strain enters via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while YFV-17D utilizes a clathrin-independent route. YFV-17D also exhibits enhanced binding and entering capabilities in vitro, and initiates inflated antiviral responses when compared to its wild-type progenitor [<xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. These divergent properties can be pin-pointed to eleven mutations within the E protein&#x02019;s primary amino acid sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f002">Figure 2</xref>), which occurred during long-term passaging of the Asibi strain in mouse brains and chicken embryos to generate the attenuated YFV-17D derivate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-viruses-11-00960">Section 6</xref>) [<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Nevertheless, identification of <italic>bona fide</italic> receptor(s) integral for YFV entry remains outstanding. The entry cascade of YFV is comprised of multiple steps which could be targeted by therapeutic intervention to inhibit further virus spreading within infected patients.

Cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase (cGAS) is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor, synthesizing, 2&#x02032;3&#x02032;-cGAMP from ATP and GTP to mediate the activation of STING.

While YFV has a limited host species-tropism, artificial infection of laboratory mice and hamsters is possible, although the course of disease differs from that observed in humans [<xref rid="B144-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Nevertheless, a number of studies in genetically modified or humanized mice have yielded insights into YFV infection and dissemination in vivo. Single cell-tracking of YFV-17D dissemination in different mouse models identified novel YFV replication reservoirs in secondary lymphoid compartments, with hematopoietic STAT1 knockout increasing virus-induced pathogenicity [<xref rid="B122-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Double-humanized mice have been developed, possessing both human immune systems and hepatocytes [<xref rid="B145-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,<xref rid="B146-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], and these animals represent ideal tools for monitoring systemic YFV infection in vivo as both compartments are permissive for YFV. In addition to hepatotropism, YFV can also be neurotropic in rodents, primates and humans [<xref rid="B147-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>,<xref rid="B148-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. In contrast to polio virus and reovirus, which infect the brain via the CNS, YFV-17D infects brain tissue by crossing the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="B149-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. A mouse-neurovirulent strain (SPYF) based on the Porterfield 17D (PYF17D) strain was derived by additional passaging in SCID mice, exhibiting enhanced neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness. This enhanced neurotopism was correlated with 13 amino acid substitutions, five of which were located in the E protein [<xref rid="B80-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Arboviruses can encounter dissemination barriers in mosquitos, restricting the spreading of the virus within the vector species. These include innate immunity related pathways as well as physical tissue barriers associated with the midgut and salivary glands [<xref rid="B150-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,<xref rid="B151-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. However, while patterns of YFV-17D dissemination in immunocompetent mice were restricted, infection of <italic>IFNAR</italic> knockout mice resulted in broad dissemination preceding viral clearance, indicating that no barriers to dissemination exist in the absence of type I IFN [<xref rid="B152-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Furthermore, while I and II type IFNs contribute to control of YFV-17D infection, type III IFN was demonstrated to have immunomodulatory functions and was protective against YFV-17D neuroinvasion in mouse models [<xref rid="B153-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. YFD-17D infection of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor and STAT1 signaling molecule deficient mice resulted in systemic viscerotropic infection: a course of disease which resembles that observed in humans rather than the typical encephalitic disease course commonly reported for mice [<xref rid="B154-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Finally, while many flaviviruses share the common ability to antagonize IFN signaling and therefore enhance viral replication, the YFV NS5 is unable to bind murine STAT2 and in contrast to ZIKV and DENV, is unable to engage human STAT2 in murine cells. Murine STAT2 was demonstrated to repress YFV replication in murine cells, which was correlated with an absence of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-mediated NS5 ubiquitination [<xref rid="B155-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Together, these mouse studies enhance our understanding of YFV dissemination and host control in vivo. These findings are useful for the development of the next generation of small animal disease models for YFV, which should endeavor to recapitulate the disease course seen in humans. Thus, the generation of an immunocompetent mouse model would be beneficial, which could be realized by knocking out downstream specific anti-YFV effectors that directly inhibit differential aspects of the YFV lifecycle, rather than upstream master-regulators of the antiviral response. Screening approaches could identify such factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6-viruses-11-00960"><title>6.

History and Development of the YFV Vaccine</title><p>In the 1920s, two parallel approaches were taken to develop a live attenuated vaccine against YFV. In 1927, YFV was isolated from a Ghanaian patient suffering from mild yellow fever and inoculated into rhesus macaques by direct blood/serum transfer [<xref rid="B157-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Max Theiler and colleagues discovered that this &#x0201c;Asibi&#x0201d; strain, which was refractory for growth in other small laboratory animals, was able to replicate in the brains of mice following intracranial injection. Following sequential passage in mouse brains, reduced viscerotropic virulence was observed, coupled with enhanced neurotropic properties. Therefore, the Asibi strain subsequently underwent serial passage in chicken embryo tissue, after head and spinal column removal. After 176 passages, the attenuated YFV-17D strain had lost its viscerotropism, neurotropism and mosquito competence, while retaining its immunogenicity [<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Concurrently, French researchers isolated YFV from a patient in Dakar, followed by serial passage in mouse brains. This attenuated strain, termed the French neurotropic vaccine (FNV), was isolated at passage 260 and was widely used in the francophone countries of Africa, virtually eradicating the disease. However, serial passaging in mouse brain increased FNV&#x02019;s neurotropism, leading to high levels of post-vaccinal encephalitis in children. Consequently, the use of FNV was discontinued in the 1980s [<xref rid="B158-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. The 17D subculture is the seed strain for all modern-day YFV vaccines. There are three sub-strains obtained from the original 17D vaccine: the 17DD (Passage 195), 17D-204 (Passage 204) and the 17D-213, derived from 17D-204 and used by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany. These strains have slightly different genomic sequences: in particular, glycosylation sites on the envelope protein vary, although no differences in attenuation or immunogenicity have been observed [<xref rid="B159-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>].

However, when Angola was hit by urban outbreak which spread to neighboring countries, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x02019;s capital Kinshasa, the epidemic created an urgent need for more than 28 million doses of the YFV vaccine, exhausting the existing global vaccine supply [<xref rid="B182-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>,<xref rid="B183-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>,<xref rid="B184-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>].

It is estimated that vaccine manufactures can produce a combined 80 million doses per year [<xref rid="B160-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. However, as YFV-17D-based vaccines are still produced in chicken eggs, this results in issues with supply and demand during outbreaks due to limited production capabilities [<xref rid="B187-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Another limiting issue during current production is the stability of live-attenuated vaccines. Antigen instability is an inherent attribute of vaccines, compounded by a requirement for conformationally correct three-dimensional structures that elicit protective host responses to these complex bio-therapeutics. Therefore, more stable vaccines with reduced dependency on the cold chain represent an area for future vaccine development [<xref rid="B188-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. Thermal stability is important for the manufacture, distribution and administration of vaccines, especially in tropical developing countries where adverse field conditions exist.

In addition, there are common side effects of the vaccine, ranging from muscle aches, chills, flu-like symptoms, joint pain, mild fever, mild rash, muscle weakness and swelling at the injection site. Using transcriptomic and metabolic profiling of 17D-204 vaccinees, it has recently been demonstrated that symptomatic outcomes to vaccination were associated with baseline endoplasmic reticulum stress and reduced tricarboxcylic acid cycle activity, initiating downstream proinflammatory responses [<xref rid="B191-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>].

Collapsed clades contain closely related isolates from recent Brazilian and Angolan outbreaks, in addition to 17D vaccine strains. Based on this analysis, global YFV sequences can be divided into six well-supported lineages: West African lineages I and II (WAL I and WAL II), South American lineages I and II (SAL I and SAL II), the East African lineage (EAL) and the Angola lineage (AL). In agreement with a previous phylogenetic analysis of partial [<xref rid="B219-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>] and full-length ORFs [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], our expanded analysis illustrates that South American lineages are monophyletic, sharing a common ancestor with the West African lineages, and confirms a deep-divergence between these lineages and the more distantly related East African and Angolan strains, indicating an ancient separation. This observation is consistent with an African origin for YFV, with South American lineages representing historical import of West African YFV strains linked to European colonial expansions and the slave trade [<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B219-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>].</p><p>While clinical YFV isolates can be readily propagated in tissue culture, the majority of studies utilize the YFV-17D vaccine strain which has atypical properties [<xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], or its wild-type progenitor, the Asibi strain, representing only a small fraction of the global YFV diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Consequently, the phenotypic correlates of YFV global sequence diversity are incompletely defined and future studies should address this discrepancy: it is currently unknown whether infection with isolates from different YFV lineages contributes to differential pathogenicity or mortality rates in humans. However, in spite of these deep-divergences apparent in the YFV phylogeny, the 17D vaccine provides robust protection against strains from all known YFV lineages.</p><sec><title>YFV Genome and Polyprotein Conservation</title><p>To visualize variability across YFV genomes and encoded polyproteins, similarity plots were generated from YFV nucleotide and amino acid alignments. Inspection of genetic and amino acid variability in globally sampled YFV isolates highlights conserved and variable regions in the genome and encoded polyprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). Of note, YFV nucleotide variability is much greater than amino acid variability, indicating strong purifying selection shapes global patterns of YFV evolution. This is likely a reflection of the selective constraints imposed by the viral transmission cycle: YFV experiences sequential bottlenecks upon continued cycling through an insect vector, coupled with requirements for host factor compatibility in both vertebrates and arthropods. Furthermore, the YFV RdRp has a relatively high fidelity for an RNA virus, with an estimated mutation rate per site of 1.9&#x02013;2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> [<xref rid="B223-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>].

Mapping of global amino acid diversity on to the resolved helicase structures for YFV [<xref rid="B221-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>] is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00960-f004">Figure 4</xref>c, highlighting the conserved regions of this essential virtual protein. Together these analyses, conducted using sequence and structural data available in public databases, can inform rational development of antivirals targeting different components of the YFV virion or replication machinery. Currently, structural data is only available for YFV E, NS3 and NS5 proteins. The elucidation of structural information for the outstanding YFV proteins will expand the number of potential viral targets for future structure-based antiviral drug design studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8-viruses-11-00960"><title>8. Monitoring YFV Outbreaks, Disease-Course and Reservoir Species with NGS</title><sec id="sec8dot1-viruses-11-00960"><title>8.1. Diagnostic Utility of NGS</title><p>The use of NGS technologies allows recovery of complete viral genomic sequences directly from infected patients&#x02019; material, and these metagenomic approaches have revolutionized infectious disease outbreak diagnostics and surveillance in recent years [<xref rid="B225-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. In Africa and South America, YFV co-circulates with multiple endemic VHFs which can emerge in humans sporadically, complicating initial diagnosis. These include Ebola viruses (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Junin virus (JUNV) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV). The diagnostic capacity of NGS to discriminate between hemorrhagic fever viruses from diverse families and orders, including the <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>, <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, <italic>Filoviridae</italic> and <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, has been reported [<xref rid="B226-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Indeed, using 454 sequencing (Roche), YFV was identified as the causative agent of an outbreak of VHF in Northern Uganda in 2010 [<xref rid="B227-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>], validating the diagnostic utility of NGS technologies for discriminating YFV outbreaks from unrelated hemorrhagic fever viruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec8dot2-viruses-11-00960"><title>8.2. Outbreak Monitoring in Real-Time</title><p>More recently, as NGS technology has advanced, hand-held nanopore sequencing devices (MinION, Oxford Nanopore) have been deployed to monitor viral outbreaks, including the West African 2013-16 EBOV outbreak [<xref rid="B228-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>] and the Lassa fever virus (LASV) outbreak in Nigeria in 2018 [<xref rid="B229-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. This technology has multiple advantages for pathogen surveillance in real-time when compared to conventional NGS platforms including low cost, portability, easy library preparation, and rapid generation of data in just a few hours [<xref rid="B230-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. The re-emergence of YFV as a global health burden has been demonstrated by multiple recent outbreaks [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In combination with the ION Torrent and Illumina platforms, MinION sequencing was utilized to provide insights into the molecular epidemiology of the 2016&#x02013;2017 YFV outbreak in Brazil, generating data spatially correlating infections of humans with infection of non-human primates [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These data indicate that vector-mediated transmission in the Brazilian outbreak was dominated by continued primate-to-human transmission rather than a human-to-human transfer often observed in explosive African outbreaks. While future outbreaks are inevitable, rapid identification of YFV as the causative agent and subsequent real-time tracking of epidemics can be facilitated by recent advances in NGS technologies and phylogenetics [<xref rid="B231-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>], enhancing effective outbreak management, including coordinating vaccination programs and vector eradication campaigns. Additionally, in future outbreaks, viral sampling could be coupled with serological markers of infection (anti-YFV antibodies) and patient DNA bio-banking to enable stratification of host-genetic correlates of YFV infection outcomes, and correlation with host single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It is likely that host genetics underlie the range of clinical symptoms observed in YFV infection, which include subclinical, symptomatic, severe and fatal outcomes. However, significant challenges to wide-spread implementation of the strategies outlined above should not be underestimated. High costs associated with NGS, coupled with underdeveloped infrastructure in the majority of YFV-endemic countries remain logistical obstacles to overcome.</p><p>In addition to diagnosis and outbreak surveillance, the application of NGS to longitudinal and cross-sectional monitoring of infected patient cohorts can facilitate advances in our understanding of within-host viral evolution. Despite near-perfect environmental conditions, including the presence of replication-competent <italic>Aedes</italic> vector species, YFV outbreaks in Asia remain conspicuously absent. However, import of YFV from the Angolan outbreak to China was recorded for the first time in 2016 [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B232-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Using Illumina sequencing to follow virus evolution in 12 imported YFV cases revealed the infecting strains were closely related to each other and possessed limited divergence from the Angola 1971 strain (three amino acid substitutions) despite a 45-year period between samplings [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B233-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. The action of strong purifying selection was detected throughout viral genomes, with intra-host variation dominated by synonymous substitutions [<xref rid="B233-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. In agreement with these observations, the evolutionary rate of YFV has been shown to be lower than that of DENV [<xref rid="B234-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>] and the YFV RdRp possesses high fidelity [<xref rid="B223-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. In addition, sequential bottlenecks associated with vector-host switching could potentially select for variants with an enhanced capacity for transmission, reducing variation. Constraints on YFV evolution could also be mediated by the requirement for interactions with host-dependency factors essential for replication and dissemination in both mammals and arthropods, coupled with a limited duration of infection in human hosts.</p></sec><sec id="sec8dot3-viruses-11-00960"><title>8.3. Identification of Novel Animal Reservoirs</title><p>YFV represents a zoonotic pathogen: while many zoonotic viruses cause severe pathology in humans, tolerance and absence of disease is often observed in reservoir species [<xref rid="B235-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. After long periods of absence, sporadic and often explosive YFV outbreaks occur in endemic regions, initiated by vector-mediated spillover from jungle primates when environmental conditions are favorable. This pattern of emergence poses the question of whether, in addition to described host- and vector-species, other as yet unidentified animal or arthropod species can act as reservoirs for YFV. Vertical transmission of YFV between mosquitos has been reported [<xref rid="B236-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>,<xref rid="B237-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. While transmission rates are low (~1%), this capacity could maintain YFV reservoirs during dry periods which are not favorable for transmission [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has been suggested that primate density is often not sufficient to maintain stable sylvatic transmission, and YFV reservoirs in non-primate species could maintain inter-epidemic YFV [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Indeed, serum neutralizing antibodies for YFV were detected in ten forest mammal species from French Guiana, including members of the divergent orders Rodentia and Carnivora, the superorder Xenarthra, as well as multiple primate species [<xref rid="B143-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. Thus, the breadth of YFV species-specificity remains to be determined. To further investigate this, extensive sampling and NGS screening of jungle species in YFV endemic regions could be undertaken, potentially identifying novel animal reservoirs which silently maintain YFV transmission between intermittent outbreaks. In summary, future YFV outbreaks can be rapidly identified and epidemics monitored at high resolution using NGS to inform containment strategies. This technology also lends itself to tracking intra-host evolution and the identification of novel animal reservoirs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec9-viruses-11-00960"><title>9. Modes of YFV Transmission and Future Vector Control Strategies</title><p>YFV is transmitted by mosquito vectors between primate hosts and transmission to humans in three distinct cycles is possible. 1. The sylvatic or jungle cycle&#x02014;where epizootic transmission between rainforest primates by jungle-resident mosquito species occurs, with sporadic spillover to forestry workers. This is mediated by multiple <italic>Aedes</italic> species in Africa and <italic>Haemogogus</italic> and <italic>Sabethes</italic> species in South America; 2. The intermediate or savannah cycle&#x02014;occurs in isolated rural communities on the rainforest periphery where infected mosquito species feed simultaneously on both primate and human hosts. In Africa, <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> preferentially feeds on primates while <italic>Aedes simpsonii</italic> feeds indiscriminately on nonhuman primates and humans; 3. The urban cycle&#x02014;where invasive domesticated mosquitoes (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) facilitate YFV transmission from human-to-human in areas of high human and vector population density [<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The 2015&#x02013;2016 outbreak in Angola is considered an urban outbreak, with human mobility and population density identified as important factors in the spatial expansion of the epidemic [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Contrastingly, detailed analyses of the 2016&#x02013;2017 Brazilian YFV outbreak suggests the sylvatic cycle represents the dominant mode of transmission [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Urban YFV outbreaks are associated with <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> transmission, although the Asian tiger mosquito, <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, is also competent for YFV transmission [<xref rid="B238-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. Both species are invasive, are able to breed in water containers and have drought-resistant eggs. Indeed, the geographical distribution of these important vector species continues to increase, fueled by human population growth, globalization, increasing urbanization and ongoing climate change [<xref rid="B239-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>], expanding the risk of human exposure to YFV infection. The expansion of the 2016&#x02013;2017 outbreak in Brazil to an area not previously considered endemic for YFV serves to underline this point [<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, during YFV outbreaks, while isolated cases can be imported from endemic to non-endemic regions [<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], continued host-to-host transmission of YFV observed in outbreaks is only possible in geographic regions where competent vector species reside: the disease is not contagious in their absence. This facet of the viral life cycle has been exploited in the past to control and even eradicate YFV from specific regions. While YFV has never been controlled in Africa, vector control programs coupled with the absence of a sylvatic cycle enabled its complete eradication from Europe and North America, where devastating outbreaks were previously common [<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Vector control programs in South America all but eradicated <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> by the 1960s [<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], although this vector species has re-populated the continent due to the cessation of such programs and remains endemic in 13 countries [<xref rid="B240-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. In addition, vector resistance to traditional insecticides has been detected in the major invasive <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors and is becoming an increasing problem [<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B241-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>,<xref rid="B242-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. Thus, in combination with traditional chemical spraying of vector breeding sites and vaccination campaigns targeted to at-risk people in endemic regions, innovative new strategies for vector control are required to help to manage and reduce the likelihood of future arbovirus outbreaks, including YFV [<xref rid="B243-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>].</p><p>Mosquito population suppression strategies which harness the power of genetic modification include the <underline>r</underline>elease of <underline>i</underline>nsects carrying a <underline>d</underline>ominant <underline>l</underline>ethal gene (RIDL). In trials performed on the Cayman Islands, engineered male <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> RIDL mosquitos (strain OX513A) carrying a dominant lethal transgene were released, resulting in the suppression of wild mosquito numbers [<xref rid="B244-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. In a complementary approach using bacteria which are known to render mosquitos sterile, researchers were recently able to virtually eliminate <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from two test-release sites in China, combining population suppression and population replacement strategies [<xref rid="B245-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. Male mosquitoes artificially infected with Wolbachia <italic>w</italic>Pip strains were unable to produce viable offspring after mating with non-<italic>w</italic>Pip infected females, and <italic>w</italic>Pip infected mosquitos of both sexes were less susceptible to infection with the pathogenic flaviviruses DENV and ZIKV [<xref rid="B246-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. Pupal irradiation boosted viable mosquito numbers for use in the trial ten-fold compared to previous conventional manual inspection techniques, and this combined approach was able to substantially reduce both wild mosquito numbers and biting rates at test-sites [<xref rid="B245-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>,<xref rid="B246-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. While the current limitations of approaches outlined above include associated costs, relatively small trial sizes and isolated trial sites, these exiting results pave the way for analogous trials with <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in YFV endemic regions.</p><p>Arboviruses often replicate in mosquito mid-gut and targeting this site of viral replication via genetic modification represents another possible strategy for ablating vector-mediated transmission of YFV. Indeed, DENV dissemination and replication were restricted in transgenic <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitos ectopically expressing Loqs2, which interacts with intrinsically expressed Loquacious and r2d2 to restore efficient siRNA suppression of viral replication in the mosquito midgut [<xref rid="B247-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>]. Furthermore, attenuated YFV-17D is able to replicate in mosquito mid-gut. However, in contrast to wild-type strains, the basal membrane of the midgut blocks YFV-17D dissemination to other tissues [<xref rid="B153-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>], indicating a loss of interaction with a co-opted mid-gut host factor during 17D attenuation. In the future, genetic modification of YFV <italic>Aedes</italic> vector species using CRISPR/Cas9 [<xref rid="B222-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>] could preferentially target co-opted factors in the mosquito midgut or other tissues which are essential YFV propagation and dissemination. The ability of researchers to identify such factors, which are currently unknown, is enhanced by an improved annotated genome for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="B248-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. Indeed, these data identified gene loci potentially associated with DENV competence and insecticide resistance. In addition, quantification and comparison of gene expression profiles for distinct <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> tissues, from both male and female mosquitos at different stages of the reproductive cycle are described [<xref rid="B248-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>,<xref rid="B249-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. Together, these data highlight tissue- and sex-specific gene products, which could be further investigated to identify essential YFV replication cofactors in the mosquito mid-gut via iterative screening approaches. Genetically modified mosquitos with CRISPR/Cas9 targeted deletion of such factors could then be generated for replacement studies. In summary, targeting vector species, which have become resistant to traditional insecticides, will be key in reducing future YFV outbreaks. The future of eliminating YFV from endemic regions may involve the suppression or replacement of wild-type mosquitos with modified insects which are not competent for YFV replication. Furthermore, sequencing efforts to expand the number of annotated genomes from jungle-resident mosquito species should commence.</p></sec><sec id="sec10-viruses-11-00960"><title>10. Concluding Remarks</title><p>YFV is the prototypic flavivirus&#x02014;a zoonotic pathogen which is responsible for continuing outbreaks of VHF in tropical regions. Recent epidemics in Angola and Brazil serve to underline that the threat from this re-emerging pathogen remains high despite the long-standing availability of a protective vaccine. Scaling back of vector control programs, low vaccine coverage and limitations on vaccine production impedes effective management of outbreaks. Furthermore, rapid global warming, coupled with increasing urbanization and globalization, is expanding permissive mosquito ranges and increasing the potential for future outbreaks. Therefore, intensification of basic YFV research is imperative to expand current knowledge of the complex viral life cycle and stimulate the development of novel anti-YFV therapeutics targeted at both the virus and the host. Additionally, disentangling immune correlates of YFV-induced pathogenesis versus protection, addressing bottlenecks associated with vaccine production, real-time surveillance of outbreaks and genetic modification of vector species to reduce YFV permissiveness can all contribute to future efforts aimed at reducing mortality rates associated with YFV epidemics.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-viruses-11-00960"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/10/960/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/10/960/s1</uri>, Table S1: Summary of structural and functional properties of YFV proteins.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="viruses-11-00960-s001"><media xlink:href="viruses-11-00960-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Writing&#x02014;original draft preparation: R.D.V.K., E.M.-D., T.K., S.H., S.C., R.J.P.B.; writing&#x02014;review &#x00026; editing: R.D.V.K., R.J.P.B.; data analysis and visualization: K.W., B.T. and R.J.P.B.

Nucleotide sequence alignment (10239 nucleotides) was generated in MEGA7 [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and adjusted manually to ensure maintenance of the polyprotein ORF.

The triangles positioned below indicate the position of the NS3-encoded RNA helicase. Degrees of amino acid or underlying nucleotide or similarity at individual sites/residues in global alignments were calculated in CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen Aarhaus) and relative similarities are color-coded according to the scale bars positioned to the right. The associated pie charts indicate the proportion of conserved or variable sites in each dataset. The numbers inset indicate the actual numbers of variable and conserved amino acids or nucleotides in the alignment. (<bold>C</bold>) Conservation and variability in the YFV RNA helicase.
