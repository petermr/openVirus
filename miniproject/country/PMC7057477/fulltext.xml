ZIKV is one of the rising pathogens promptly surpassing geographical borders. ZIKV infection was characterized by mild disease with fever, headache, rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, with exceptional reports of an association with Guillain&#x02013;Barre syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly. However, since the end of 2015, an increase in the number of GBS associated cases and an astonishing number of microcephaly in fetus and new-borns in&#x000a0;Brazil&#x000a0;have been related to ZIKV infection, raising serious worldwide public health concerns. ZIKV is transmitted by the bite of infected female mosquitoes of <italic>Aedes</italic> species. Clarifying such worrisome relationships is, thus, a current unavoidable goal.

ZIKV antibodies were also detected in animal species, especially non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

However, some consider the American outbreak strain as its own lineage. Epidemiology studies revealed distribution of ZIKV in half of the north African continent, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistan (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

The protein is cleaved into capsid (C), envelope (E), precursor of membrane (prM) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1-NS2A-NS2BNS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The major virion surface protein is E protein. This protein is involved in various features of the viral cycle, membrane fusion and mediating binding. The largest viral protein whose C-terminal portion has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is NS5 protein activity and its N-terminus is responsible for RNA capping because of its processing due to methyl transferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. 428 nucleotides and 27 folding patterns are present in the 39 NCR of the ZIKV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Surrounding residues and glycosylation site on ZIKV may be responsible for attachment of virus to human cells. The amino acids variations among different flaviviruses could suggest the differences in the varieties of human cells where it can attach and infect.

At present there is no vaccine available for ZIKV infection. Vaccines against flaviviral infections available for use of human are yellow fever vaccine, Japanese encephalitis vaccine, tick-borne encephalitis vaccines and dengue vaccine, so the rules for the vector borne infections must be followed in order to prevent ZIKV infection, as well as avoiding mosquito bite and control of vector is the only available options. Animal models of the ZIKV disease are immediately required not only for exhibiting the materno-fetal transmission and confirmation of its neurologic manifestations but also to report the influence of virus on host&#x02019;s immunity and reproductive health throughout the life. ZIKV infection is increasing dramatically, so it is the need of hour to take some necessary steps to eliminate this lethal infection and to constrain its future entrance as well. ZIKV specific rapid molecular diagnosis should be done urgently in order to detect the infection in less time before it aggravates. Modern techniques of molecular biology should be utilized to make vaccine specific to ZIKV. Research gaps should be addressed promptly and systematically.
