imperative. This perspective provides an overview of important molecular pathways involved in
the viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, the infectious agent of COVID-19. We highlight past and
recent findings in essential coronavirus proteins, including RNA polymerase machinery,
proteases, and fusion proteins, that offer opportunities for the design of novel inhibitors of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. By discussing the current inventory of viral inhibitors, we identify
molecular scaffolds that may be improved by medicinal chemistry efforts for effective
therapeutics to treat current and future coronavirus-caused diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>fusion</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>antivirals</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ml0c00254</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ml0c00254</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="sec1">Most of the world&#x02019;s initial efforts to treat Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have
focused on the repurposing of approved drugs. This approach is warranted, as we seek quick
solutions to a pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The recent announcement of the antiviral remdesivir as the first U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of patients suffering from severe symptoms
of COVID-19 affirms this approach. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) said that the completed clinical trial with remdesivir
proved &#x0201c;that a drug can block this virus&#x0201d;, although this drug alone is not a
&#x0201c;magic bullet&#x0201d; for COVID-19.</p><p>Without the ability to accurately predict a timeline for a vaccine, we need additional
clinical candidates to build an arsenal against SARS-CoV infections. Related coronaviruses,
SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), caused serious, albeit
less widespread, health epidemics starting in 2002 and 2012. The occurrence of multiple
outbreaks further motivates us to annotate therapeutic targets for other coronavirus-caused
diseases that might develop in the future. Similar to the treatment of influenza, we would
benefit from multiprong defense tactics that include both vaccines and therapeutic agents. Many
recent scientific reviews and essays have outlined vaccine efforts, as well as viral and host
targets that are the focus of current campaigns aimed at redirecting clinically used compounds
for COVID-19.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup></p><p>Here, we outline viral pathways that contain druggable targets currently overlooked and
propose general mechanisms to disrupt these pathways. We begin with a short primer on the
SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle and an overview of existing drugs that are the subject of current
clinical trials around the world. We then focus on alternative druggable targets largely within
the viral replicase machinery, as well as viral entry and proteolytic processing pathways. Our
proposed strategies for blocking these pathways are informed by past and current work on
inhibitors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other successful antivirals. We hope to engage
the medicinal chemistry community with ideas for novel therapeutic targets in order to develop
<italic>new drugs</italic> to specifically disarm coronaviruses in the host.</p><sec id="sec2"><title>Overview of the Viral Life Cycle</title><p>The genome organization of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other members of the
&#x003b2;-coronavirus family that also include SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The
viral RNA-encoded proteins can be divided into two main classes: structural and nonstructural
proteins (nsps). The structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and
hemagglutinin esterase) form the viral particle and play additional functional roles during
infection. Viral infection begins with an interaction between the viral spike glycoprotein (S
protein) and a receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on the host cell surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). ACE2 is expressed in various cell types,
including those in the lungs. Host proteases in the membrane are important in this
process;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> namely, a cellular serine protease, called transmembrane serine
protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is known to prime the trimer of S protein on the viral particle surface
prior to cell entry. Cleavage of S protein into two subunits is required for the process of
viral and host membrane fusion prior to viral uptake by an endocytic mechanism.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the proposed viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, the infectious agent of COVID-19.
Both viral and host machinery are essential for viral infection, replication, reassembly, and
egress. Remdesivir, the only FDA approved drug for COVID-19 treatment, blocks RNA replication.
Highlighted are points of viral interference that have not been widely exploited: (1)
inhibition of additional components of the viral replication&#x02013;transcription complex
(RTC); (2) development of new modes of disrupting viral protease activities; and (3)
exploration of peptide-based inhibitors to prevent host&#x02013;viral membrane fusion.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ml0c00254_0002" id="GRAPHIC-d7e186-autogenerated" position="float"/></fig><p>Following engulfment and subsequent release from the endosome, viral genetic material is
released into the host cytoplasm prior to translation of the single stranded viral RNA into long
polypeptides that contain the nsps. Viral polypeptides are predicted to be cleaved into 16
individual nsps through an autoprocessing mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> There are two
cysteine-like proteases expressed as part of these polypeptides: one is a papain-like protease
(PLP), known as the accessory protease; the other is a chymotrypsin-like protease
(3CL<sup>pro</sup>), known as the main protease. 3CL<sup>pro</sup> cleaves itself and processes
the remaining polypeptide into nsps 7&#x02013;16, which make up the RNA replication-transcription
complex (RTC). Several components of the RTC aid the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which
is responsible for replicating additional copies of the RNA genome and transcribing multiple
mRNA fragments that encode either structural or accessory proteins. Following multiple cycles of
replication and translation, the viral particle assembles and exits the cell though a budding
mechanism known as scission. It is thought that &#x003b2;-coronaviruses rely on the host
cell&#x02019;s endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), but the exact method of
egress is still not known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Full scission from the host cell releases the
virus to infect more cells and continue to replicate.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Known Drugs in Clinical Trials for COVID-19 Target the Viral Life Cycle</title><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and federal agencies are largely focused on clinical
trials for preapproved drugs that are proposed to target some aspect of the viral life cycle
described above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). The NIH now lists over a
thousand ongoing clinical trials for treatments relating to COVID-19. The WHO is currently
conducting a worldwide trial (&#x0201c;SOLIDARITY&#x0201d;) by focusing on four promising COVID-19
treatments: remdesivir; lopinavir/ritonavir with and without Interferon &#x003b2;-1a (to help
stimulate the immune system); and hydroxychloroquine (this last treatment has currently been
paused).</p><p>The FDA-approved COVID-19 drug, remdesivir, is a nucleotide analog originally developed to
treat Ebola infections (caused by another single-stranded RNA virus) and recently shown to
inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> The FDA has issued an emergency use
authorization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, both of which are approved to treat malaria
and various autoimmune disorders, and might function by disrupting endosome-mediated entry or
egress of the virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Lopinavir-ritonavir are HIV protease inhibitors that
are hypothesized to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL<sup>pro</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> In addition to small
molecule inhibitor candidates, various clinical trials are exploring the effect of known
antibody therapies on COVID-19 progression or plan to test antibodies raised against viral
proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Viral RNA Replicase Machinery Contains Alternative Viable Targets</title><p>The success of remdesivir in clinical trials, although limited, suggests that inhibition of
viral replication is a viable strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. Importantly, it takes more
than a single polymerase to replicate the viral genome and ensure pathogenicity. SARS-CoV-2 is
thought to involve up to nine nsps in the RTC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Key players include the RdRP
(nsp12), helicase (nsp13), and proposed polymerase cofactors/primase(s) (nsp 7, 8). To our
knowledge, these proteins are not targets in current COVID-19 clinical trials. The viral RTC
proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm and so are more accessible that their host counterparts
in the nucleus.</p><p>Coronavirus helicases are motor proteins necessary for unwinding double-stranded RNA, which
form secondary structures, in order for replication and translation to occur. Since viral
helicases typically share low homology with human DNA helicases, specific helicase inhibitors
are unlikely to be toxic to the host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-1
helicase is identical to that found in SARS-CoV-2; hence, a solved crystal structure of the
SARS-CoV-1 helicase provides opportunities for rational drug design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> The
Lupoli and Zhang laboratories (NYU, Chemistry) are currently using this structure to design
small molecule ligands for computationally predicted binding pockets. In addition to a
nucleotide binding site, the SARS-CoV helicase contains a zinc binding domain with three zinc
fingers, and mutation of residues linking this domain to the helicase core domain were shown to
cause a deficiency in nucleic acid unwinding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> As a result, there are
multiple sites for disruption of helicase activity.</p><p>Unique among other RNA viruses, coronaviruses are believed to have two nsps with RNA
polymerase activity. The canonical RdRP is primer-dependent for optimal activity, while the
second polymerase (nsp8) is hypothesized to be a primase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> The primary
sequences of nsp7, 8 and RdRP are &#x02265;96% identical in SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2. A solved
cryoelectron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-1 RTC complex has shown that interactions
between RdRP, nsp7 and 8 are essential for activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Interestingly, the
main RdRP also has an N-terminal kinase-like domain that may carry out nucleotidyltransfer
reactions. Disruption of this site or any member of this complex represents a novel opportunity
for chemical interference.</p><p>Inhibition of helicase or primase activities has been pursued as an antiviral approach in the
past and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Importantly, herpes simplex
virus (HSV) helicase UL5 is a member of the same helicase super family 1 (SF1) as SARS-CoV-2
nsp13. In 2002, Boehringer-Ingelheim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> and Bayer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup>
independently reported on inhibitors of the HSV helicase&#x02013;primase complex that were
comparative to approved antivirals for HSV. Boehringer-Ingelheim&#x02019;s
aminothiazoylphenyl-based inhibitors of HSV helicase&#x02013;primase, namely, BILS 179 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, compound <bold>1</bold>), exhibit nanomolar
antiviral activity and are selective for HSV infection in mouse models. The clinically used
amenamevir (<bold>2</bold>), another herpes antiviral, also targets in the
helicase&#x02013;primase at nanomolar concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> The most promising
inhibitor of SARS-CoV-1 helicase, SSYA10-001 (<bold>3</bold>), which shows micromolar activity
against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections in vitro, was awarded a US patent in
2014.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> Given the
conservation of helicase sequences in SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2, this inhibitor will likely serve as
a useful starting point for future design of coronavirus helicase modulators.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Select chemical scaffolds for viral target disruption. Existing viral helicase inhibitors

translated from viral RNA, viral 3CL<sup>pro</sup> (also called M<sup>pro</sup>) and PLP have
emerged as popular targets for COVID-19. HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir,
included in the SOLIDARITY trial despite mixed reviews in the clinic, have been predicted to
bind SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> (96% sequence identity) based on computational
studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> While HIV proteases are aspartic proteases, coronavirus proteases
are members of the cysteine protease family. Given that approximately a quarter of human
proteases are predicted to belong to this class, design of specific viral inhibitors remains a
challenge. Fortunately, to aid in the rational design of inhibitors, a crystal structure of
SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> was reported recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> As part of this work,
peptidomimetic compounds (&#x003b1;-keto amides), previously designed against &#x003b2;- and
&#x003b1;-coronaviruses, were modified for stability. The most promising mimetic (<bold>4</bold>)
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells at micromolar concentrations and therefore
requires further improvement. Carboxamide and acetamide scaffold structures have been shown to
inhibit 3CL<sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-1, along with other inhibitors that have been reviewed
elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Another viable viral target, PLP, shows lower sequence
conservation between SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 (76% homology). Notably, PLP possesses additional
activities beyond polypeptide processing, such as deubiquitination and cleavage of the
ubiquitin-like modifier, ISG15. These PLP-dependent activities contribute to viral immune
evasion in the host. Inhibitors of PLP-mediated ISG15 cleavage activity, such as compound
<bold>5</bold>, have EC<sub>50</sub> values of &#x0223c;10 uM against SARS-CoV-1 infection in
cell culture with no associated cytotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Structural information and
the noted unique features of SARS-CoV cysteine proteases can be exploited for selective
inhibition, but existing scaffolds still require optimization to disable SARS-CoV-2 infections
in the host.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Peptide-Based Approaches for Membrane Fusion Inhibitors</title><p>The S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 share 76% overall sequence identity, yet the receptor
binding domain (RBD) of the latter has 10&#x02013;20-fold higher affinity to the human ACE2
receptor protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> After the RBD binds ACE2, two heptad repeat domains, HR1
and HR2, interact to form a six-helical bundle, and in so doing bring the viral and host
membrane proximal to one another resulting in fusion. This fusion process is essential for viral
entry. Design of &#x0201c;coiled coil&#x0201d; heptad repeat-based peptides provides an avenue for
drug design that can easily be tailored to respond to mutations that will arise in future S
proteins. Using a recently solved crystal structure of the HR1 and HR2 domains of the SARS-CoV-2
S protein, lipidated peptide fusion inhibitors have been designed that inhibit pseudovirus
infection of cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the single-digit nanomolar range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Targeting membrane fusion with peptide-based inhibitors offers opportunities and
flexibility for entry inhibition in future coronavirus strains, but the cost and possible side
effects may be a deterrent for widespread global use.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We envision that in the coming months and years, there will be three phases of therapeutic
intervention for COVID-19: (1) repurposing of existing drugs as treatments and prophylactics;
(2) the development of vaccines; and, (3) as the threat of a mutated virus looms large, the
development of an arsenal of compounds that are available against other targets to sustain a
defense against widespread infection. The reservoir of targets and available compounds against
this and related viruses described in this perspective is a resource that medicinal chemists are
encouraged to explore further.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="disclosure" id="notes-100"><p>Views expressed in this editorial are those of the authors and not necessarily the views of
