A large number of natural compounds are under trial for screening compounds, possessing potential inhibitory effect against the viral infection. Keeping in view the importance of marine compounds in antiviral activity, we investigated the potency of some marine natural products to target SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) (PDB ID 6MO3). The crystallographic structure of M<sup>pro</sup> in an apo form was retrieved from Protein Data Bank and marine compounds from PubChem. These structures were prepared for docking and the complex with good docking score was subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for a period of 100&#x02009;ns. To measure the stability, flexibility, and average distance between the target and compounds, root mean square deviations (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and the distance matrix were calculated. Among five marine compounds, C-1 (PubChem CID 11170714) exhibited good activity, interacting with the active site and surrounding residues, forming many hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. The C-1 also attained a stable dynamic behavior, and the average distance between compound and target remains constant. In conclusion, marine natural compounds may be used as a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 for better management of COVID-19.</p><p><fig id="UF0001" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><graphic content-type="color" xlink:href="TBSD_A_1769733_UF0001_C"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Marine drugs</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>dock</kwd><kwd>interactions</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Ministry of Science and Technology of China</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Joint Research Funds for Medical and Engineering and Scientific Research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University</named-content></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Dong-Qing Wei is supported by the grants from the Key Research Area Grant 2016YFA0501703 of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Contract no. 61832019, 61503244), the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (Grant: 19430750600), the Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (162300410060), and Joint Research Funds for Medical and Engineering and Scientific Research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (YG2017ZD14).

According to the WHO latest report, 3,442,234 are confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected people including 239,740 deaths. Among the six WHO regions, the largest number of cases has been reported from Europe (1,544,145) followed by Americas (1,433,756), Eastern Mediterranean (211,555), Western Pacific (152,774), South-East Asia (68,756), and Africa (30,536) (WHO COVID-19 Dashboard, n.d.). Since it was first identified in December 2019, COVID-19 has infected a large population of people around the world (Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report-35, n.d.).</p><p>The SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV, is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) betacoronavirus, responsible for a severe pathological condition (Guarner, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The COVID-19 is expanding rapidly as compared with previous coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) with the absence of therapeutic agents (Heymann et&#x000a0;al., 2020; Zhang &#x00026; Liu, <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). On January 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as &#x02018;public health emergency&#x02019; in responding to SARS-COVID-19.</p><p>Unfortunately, the timeline for characterizing a typical drug discovery process badly couples with the urgency of finding a therapy. It is important to accelerate the early stages of the drug discovery for all possible future emergencies (Mani et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The early extraction of the COVID-19 genome to highlight sequence identity (&#x0223c;80% of conserved nucleotides) with respect to the original SARS-CoV (Gralinski &#x00026; Menachery, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) has paved the way for rapid research.</p><p>Although commercially synthetic sources prepared many drugs but the major hurdles, drug side effects, resistance, cell toxicity, and long-term treatment, were some factors behind the failure. The potential marine products are playing a pivotal role in the identification of novel prototypes and also developing drugs using natural products of the marine environment (Vo &#x00026; Kim, <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wittine et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Over two-thirds of the planet has been covered by marine species, making them a major source for novel drug-like compounds (Aneiros &#x00026; Garateix, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Mayer et&#x000a0;al., 2019). Further, a possible vaccine target is viral structural proteins, the development of which is desirable and it is foreseen that the first candidates will be advanced to clinical phase I around mid-2020 (Boopathi et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Keener, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Khan, Jha et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Letko &#x00026; Munster, <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sarma et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wrapp et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In the meantime, however, a great effort involves the targeting of nonstructural viral proteins which are instead essential for the viral replication and the maturation processes, representing a specific target for anti-COVID-19 drug development (Ahmed et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Anand et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Gan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Gupta et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Hasan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Khan, Zia et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Sirois et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wei et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Zhang &#x00026; Liu, <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In the current scenario, the crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) also called 3CL hydrolase or C30 endopeptidase, was made available to the scientific community, just a few weeks after the first COVID-19 outbreak (PDB ID: 6LU7 in complex, 6MO3 apo). The structural characterization of the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) shares 96.1% of its sequence with those of previous SARS-CoV, contained a highly conserved architecture of the catalytic binding site. We took advantage of the recently solved crystallographic structure of SARS-COVID-19 to perform a cutting edge <italic>in-silico</italic> investigation.</p><p>Once the cell is infected with COVID-19, the existing molecular machinery of the host cell is taken over by the virus to translate its RNA into long chains of proteins, producing more copies. These long viral proteins are activated when cut into smaller pieces by proteases. Hence, viral proteases have a critical role in the propagation of the virus. Identification of specific inhibitors from natural products against the COVID-19 M<sup>pro</sup> might be of great importance in terms of proposing the treatment regimen. Here in the current study, we searched some marine compounds and docked into the M<sup>pro</sup>, shows a good binding interactions that might be useful against COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s0003"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0004"><label>2.1.</label><title>Protein preparation</title><p>The recently submitted crystal structure of COVID-19 M<sup>pro</sup> in an apo form (PDB ID: <bold>6M03</bold>; Berman et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) was extracted from Protein Data Bank.

Conventional drug development methods take years and costly, offering more time for transmission of pathogens. The appropriate and timely development of potent antiviral agents for clinical use is of central interest, using cost-effective and fast computational approaches. Moreover, the approved pharmaceutical drugs may be repurposed as alternative method to screen for rapid identification of potential leads (Chu et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Enayatkhani et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Muralidharan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Pillaiyar et&#x000a0;al., 2016; Yang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).

ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Newman &#x00026; Cragg, <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A large range of marine products displays chemical structures with good biological activities to discover drug like for various human diseases caused by virus, including COVID-19. An additional advantage of marine products, as most of them has the property of drug-likeness with high degrees of bioavailability, and effective drugs against viral diseases shortly.</p><p>M<sup>pro</sup> (3CLpro) monomer has three domains: domain I, domain II, and domain III containing residues 8&#x02013;101, residues 102&#x02013;184, and residues 201&#x02013;303 respectively, and a long loop (residues 185&#x02013;200) connects domains III and II (Wu et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The active site (Cys145 and His41) is located in the gap between domains I and II, while hydrophobic amino acids, T24, L27, H41, F140, C145, H163, M165, P168, and H172 also form a hydrophobic surrounding in the pocket (Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2003). The identification of compounds fitting in the pockets is one of the fundamental step in structure-based drug design. The recent progress and developments of the computational analysis of pockets have been found useful to screen potent inhibitors (Zheng et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Analysis of M<sup>pro</sup> complex with C1 shows many hydrogen and hydrophobic interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). The compound exhibited affinity with SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> from all sides, showing its best fitting in the pocket. Drug interactions and fitting in the pocket is essential for drug designing and lead optimization. it It is also important to identify the locations of binding sites to infer protein&#x02013;ligand binding or protein&#x02013;protein interaction.</p><fig id="F0004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Interaction of C1 after MD simulation.

The hydrogen bonds may play as an &#x02018;anchoring&#x02019; role, defining the spatial location of the druggable compounds in the binding pocket, facilitating the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. In rational drug design, it is equally essential to recognize the hydrophobic groups of the compound and receptor, facing to each other upon binding. These interactions have been detected while analyzing the Connolly surface (Connolly, 1993) of the complex of SARS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> and marine compounds. It is the steric complementarity between the ligand and receptor site that performs the role of the principal driving force for mechanical interlocking (Chou et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sirois et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wei et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>).</p><p>RMSD and RMSF are calculated in MD simulations to infer the stability and flexibility, a fundamental property of biomolecules. High deviation and fluctuation of proteins during a simulation may show weak stability and stability in thermodynamics (Chen &#x00026; Shen, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> in complexed with C1 exhibited a stable RMSD between 0.2 and 0.45&#x02009;nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>) and the initial and final RMSDs during the whole simulation period were not found in the significance difference (0.2 and 0.3&#x02009;nm). This shows a stable binding of C1 with M<sup>pro</sup> that might be a useful as a good inhibitor. Moreover, residues fluctuations were also observed, not too flexible in motion (0.05&#x02013;0.36&#x02009;nm). Both, RMSD and RMSF stabilities are essential to infer good binding affinities (Doniach &#x00026; Eastman, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Dubey et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="F0005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>RSMD and RMSF of M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with C1 compound.

However, the final and initial distance is almost similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7</xref>). The distant matrix signifies the C1 and M<sup>pro</sup> distance stability during the simulation period. This approach might be useful to infer the strong binding affinity during the simulation period (Ernst et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Khan, Ashfaq-Ur-Rehman et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
