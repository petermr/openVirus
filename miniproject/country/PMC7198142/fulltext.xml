Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Actual data on Covid-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010&#x02013;2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, highlight that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated April 27, 2020) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads but in a long-term and chronic perspective, since adoption of mitigation actions during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1_lrg"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Covid-19 outbreak in Italy is exhibiting a clear regional trend.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Long-term air-quality data correlate with Covid-19 in the Italian provinces.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Chronic atmospheric pollution may favour coronavirus spreading.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Environmental pollution should be considered in epidemics prevention.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0025"><p>Chronic exposure to air pollutants might have a role in the spread of Covid-19 in Italian regions.

Also, the relative percentage distribution of the positive test rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B) exhibit higher values in Northern Italy despite a certain uncertainty of data due to the different numbers and frequency of oropharyngeal swabs performed in various regions to test coronavirus positivity; mortality rate ranged from 18% in the northern regions to less than 5% in the others (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C).

Worthy to remind, ozone is one of the main precursors for the formation of NO<sub>2</sub>, and chronic exposure to this contaminant for almost a quarter of a year is undoubtedly of primary importance.

Our findings, if confirmed by future studies, suggest that air quality should also be considered as part of an integrated approach toward sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads. However, the role of atmospheric pollution should be considered in a long-term, chronic perspective, and adoption of mitigation actions only during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility. We need to highlight that our analyses did not include other important determinants of Covid-19 incidence and mortality, such as age structure, lifestyle factors (e.g. diet or smoking habits), the prevalence of pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory problems and diabetes prior to the pandemic, the capacity of the healthcare system, the case identification practices (e.g. the percentage of the population that were tested and the percentage of positive tests to the total number of tests), and the duration of the confinement, among others. Given these limitations, our findings should be interpreted as more hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory. As such, we call for future studies to fill this gap of knowledge by addressing at which extent the aforementioned factors may have mutually contributed to the diffusion of Covid-19 in Italy.</p><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0095">The authors, Daniele Fattorini and Francesco Regoli, declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brunekreef</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Holgate</surname><given-names>S.T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Air pollution and health</article-title><source>The Lancet</source><volume>360</volume><issue>9341</issue><year>2002</year><fpage>1233</fpage><lpage>1242</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/s0140-6736(02)11274-8</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cereda</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tirani</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rovida</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Demicheli</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ajelli</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Poletti</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Trentin</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Guzzetta</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Marziano</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barone</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Magoni</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Deandrea</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Diurno</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lombardo</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Faccini</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruno</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pariani</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Grasselli</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Piatti</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gramegna</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldanti</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Melegaro</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Merler</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>The Early Phase of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy</chapter-title><year>2020</year><comment>Arxiv pre-print</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.09320.pdf" id="intref0015">https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.09320.pdf</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>P.-S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>F.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>C.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>C.-Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>C.-C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>C.-Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>C.-H.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ambient influenza and avian influenza virus during dust storm days and background days</article-title><source>Environ.
