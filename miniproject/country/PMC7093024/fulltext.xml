Although several antiviral drugs are currently available, there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral therapies with different mechanisms of action due to emergence of drug resistance. In this study, two related compounds, chebulagic acid (CHLA) and chebulinic acid (CHLI), were identified as novel inhibitors against IAV replication. A reporter virus-based infection assay demonstrated that CHLA and CHLI exhibit no inhibitory effect on IAV entry or RNA replication during the virus replication cycle. Results of viral release inhibition assay and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay indicated that CHLA and CHLI exert their inhibitory effect on the NA-mediated viral release. Moreover, oseltamivir-resistance mutation NA/H274Y of NA is susceptible to CHLA or CHLI, suggesting a different mechanism of action for CHLA and CHLI. In summary, CHLA and CHLI are promising new NA inhibitors that may be further developed as novel antivirals against IAVs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>chebulinic acid</kwd><kwd>chebulagic acid</kwd><kwd>neuraminidase</kwd><kwd>neuraminidase inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="41"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs are effective in preventing infection or ameliorating disease severity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Vasileiou et al., 2017</xref>). However, influenza infection, as an acute respiratory disease caused by seasonal outbreaks and, periodically, pandemics of influenza viruses and accounting for up to 650,000 annual deaths globally (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization [WHO], 2018</xref>), remains a serious public health concern. This is partly due to the fact that current influenza vaccines can target only selected strains based on annual surveillance and prediction, which does not always match the circulating strains, leading to a sharp drop in vaccine efficacy (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">de Jong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Nachbagauer and Krammer, 2017</xref>). Moreover, emergence of drug resistance strains of influenza A viruses (IAVs) reduces the effectiveness of the current anti-influenza therapies. The three clinically available classes of antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza infections are the viral ion channel M2 blockers (amantadine and rimantadine), neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir), and most recently the licensed baloxavir marboxil, which is an oral cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor of influenza virus polymerase inhibitor (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Alves Galvao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alame et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kashiwagi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Heo, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Noshi et al., 2018</xref>). However, high levels of resistance to M2 channel blockers and NA inhibitors have emerged, undermining the efficacy of these drugs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Samson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">van der Vries et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lackenby et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, mutations responsible for reduced susceptibility of influenza A/H3N2 virus to baloxavir have been detected already (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Takashita et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the development of antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action is urgently needed against influenza viruses.</p><p>Natural products contain structurally diversified bioactive chemicals, which are valuable sources for new drug discovery. Among the new medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1981 and 2010, natural products or their direct derivatives account for 34% (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Harvey et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, 352 natural product samples were screened for anti-IAV activity using a phenotypic screening approach based on a recombinant IAV expressing Gaussia luciferase (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>).

Among these hit natural product samples, unripe and ripe pods of <italic>T. chebula</italic> displayed the most potent anti-IAV activity.</p><p>Unripe and ripe pods of <italic>T. chebula</italic> are two different medical materials usually prescribed in Traditional Chinese Medicine formula. However, the compositions of unripe pods and ripe pods of <italic>T. chebula</italic> are highly overlapping, and our study showed that CHLA and CHLI, two overlapped tannin constituents of the two samples, exhibit highly inhibitory effects against IAV replication, with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 1.36 and 1.86 &#x003bc;M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the SIs of CHLA and CHLI against IAV replication in MDCK cells are &#x0003e; 74 and &#x0003e; 54, respectively, suggesting that the two compounds are good candidates for novel antivirals against IAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies reported that CHLA and CHLI exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activities by targeting viral glycoprotein&#x02013;glycosaminoglycan interactions (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kesharwani et al., 2017</xref>). However, our data demonstrated that CHLA and CHLI do not interfere with influenza virus entry or RNA replication, but act as NA inhibitors targeting virus release.</p><p>Neuraminidase is a major surface glycoprotein with a sialidase activity, which contributes to the release of newly formed virions from infected cells and facilitates propagation of the virus (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2019</xref>). For the purpose of antiviral development, NA is considered one of the major targets (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Colman, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Grienke et al., 2012</xref>). Currently, four NA inhibitors are available for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza virus infections, including oseltamivir (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Shobugawa et al., 2012</xref>), zanamivir (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">von Itzstein et al., 1993</xref>), peramivir (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alame et al., 2016</xref>), and laninamivir (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kashiwagi et al., 2016</xref>). Among these drugs, oseltamivir remains a first-line therapy since it was approved in 1999. However, resistance to oseltamivir has constantly been reported due to its wide use in clinic, and various mutants with resistance to the other NA inhibitors have also appeared (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Samson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">van der Vries et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Lackenby et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is imperative to discover novel NA inhibitors with different structures and mechanisms of action.</p><p>There are 11 NA subtypes of IAV, of which N10 and N11 were recently identified in bat IAV genomes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The N1&#x02013;N9 subtypes can be phylogenetically divided into two groups. Group I includes N1, N4, N5, and N8, while group II is comprised of N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2006</xref>). Crystallographic studies show that group 1 NAs (except NA of A/H1N1pdm[09]) possess a large cavity termed 150-cavity adjacent to the catalytic site, but the 150-cavity was not observed in group 2 NAs (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Air, 2012</xref>). Upon binding of oseltamivir or zanamivir, the open 150-loop of group 1 NAs would adopt a closed conformation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2006</xref>). Besides, inhibitors targeting the 150-cavity may also effectively target group 2 influenza NAs, perhaps by inducing the rigid closed 150-loop of group-2 NAs into a half-open one (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The structure of A/H1N1pdm(09) NA presents a deficient 150-cavity in its crystal structure, conferring resistance to oseltamivir (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, another auxiliary binding site adjacent to the sialic acid binding site called &#x0201c;430-cavity&#x0201d; has also been implicated and exploited for the design of new antivirals (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Amaro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Swaminathan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>CHLA (1-<italic>O</italic>-galloyl-2,4-<italic>O</italic>-chebuloyl-3,6-<italic>O</italic>-hexahydroxydiph enoyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>D</sc>-glucose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) and CHLI (1,3,6-tri-<italic>O</italic>-galloyl-2,4-<italic>O</italic>-chebuloyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>D</sc>-glucopyranoside) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) share the same molecular backbone of a &#x003b2;-<sc>D</sc>-glucose residue linked to a chebuloyl moiety. The difference is that CHLI has three free galloyl groups attached to the &#x003b2;-<sc>D</sc>-glucose residue, while CHLA contains only one galloyl group and a hexahydrodiphenoyl (HHDP) group, which is assumed to be a substitution for the two galloyl groups (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Olennikov et al., 2015</xref>). The presence of the constrained HHDP group in CHLA is considered to result in larger spatial hindrance and less molecular flexibility. Thus, CHLI shows more broad-spectrum and potent biological activities due to the more favorable structure for entering the binding cavities or catalytic pockets of target proteases or enzymes. However, in our screening of anti-influenza activity described above, both of them showed excellent biological activity. The IC<sub>90</sub> of CHLI is even better. It can be inferred that the active site is related to its common CHEB structure. Although the mechanism of action of CHLA and CHLI on NA is not clear yet, we predict that they bind to the active site(s) of NA, either one single interaction with the 430-cavity or multiple interactions to both 150- and 430-cavities.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p>Structures of chebulagic acid <bold>(A)</bold> and chebulinic acid <bold>(B)</bold>.
