As of April 10, the time of writing this review, and based on data from the Johns Hopkins University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">https/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6</ext-link>), it has reached all continents and hotspots of infection have developed in Europe and the USA that outnumber the original focus of infection in China, where the epidemic started end of last year. Worldwide 1.6 million confirmed cases were counted (April 19: 2.3 million). Numerically, the USA leads the field with 466&#x02019;000 cases, followed by Spain (153k; k&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1000), Italy (143k), France (118k) and Germany (118k), all reporting more cases than China (83k). Then comes UK and Iran (65k each), Turkey (42k), and even small countries are reporting high numbers (Belgium and Switzerland with 24k each). The death toll is, with 96&#x02019;000 COVID&#x02010;19 victims (April 19: 161&#x02019;000), substantial; Italy and Spain, with 18k and 15k deaths, have had a disproportionately large share, followed by France and the UK. At the moment New York City reports more COVID&#x02010;19 deaths (13k on April 19) than China.</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0002"><title>Protection of healthcare personnel</title><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0003"><title>Preparedness</title><p>Despite reports of a strong operational readiness against health emergencies in half of the evaluated countries (Kandel <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), the evolving pandemic has hit the health systems very hard, even in industrialized countries. The lack of personal protective equipment, and of diagnostic tests, put doctors and nurses, in the initial phases of the pandemic, at substantial risk of infection which showed our lack of preparedness (Horton, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). By early March, 3300 healthcare workers in China were infected, and 22 died. An Italian survey showed that 20% of healthcare workers were infected (Anonymus, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). As health personnel is of critical importance for the affected populations, and can only be partially replaced (e.g. by veterinary doctors in France offering to help out, and by the recruitment of retired health personnel), their protection must be a primary concern.</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0004"><title>Virus stability</title><p>The transmission potential of the novel coronavirus cannot be explained by a greater tenacity of the virus, compared to the SARS virus. In aerosols, infectious titre dropped by 10&#x02010;fold within 3&#x000a0;h; on plastic, median half&#x02010;life was 7&#x000a0;h; but less on cardboards (van Doremalen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). For coronavirus, disinfection with ethanol or propanol (85&#x02013;95%) is effective after 30&#x000a0;s; followed by sodium hypochlorite (0.2%), while chlorhexidine is inefficient (Kampf <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0005"><title>Masks</title><p>Quantitative microbial risk assessment data are still lacking for SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2, but when using data from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, the daily mean risk of infection was high for nurses and doctors in close bodily contact with the patient, but lower for family visitors and patients sharing the same room. Respiratory masks reduced the infection risks for nurses by &#x0003e;&#x000a0;90%, while increasing the air exchange by ventilation facilitated a 58% risk reduction for visitors and patients sharing the room (Cho <italic>et al</italic>., <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).</p><p>There is only limited evidence for the efficiency of surgical masks against seasonal influenza infection in healthcare personnel, while some evidence exists for mask wearing by infected patients to protect healthcare professionals (Bunyan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). For the general public, there is not enough evidence to prove that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduces a healthy person&#x02019;s risk of becoming infected while wearing it (German Health Ministry, CDC, WHO). While evidence for efficacy of face masks is scarce, evidence is likewise lacking that it is of no use (Feng <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Some support comes from proxy data. Viral shedding in droplets, and in aerosol, was determined in exhaled breath and coughs from children and adults suffering from the common cold. The subjects were naturally infected with seasonal coronavirus, influenza virus and rhinovirus. Wearing a surgical face mask reduced coronavirus titres, as determined by RT&#x02010;PCR, both in droplets and in aerosols; while for influenza virus, masks decreased only viral titres in droplets, and for rhinovirus, the mask had no effect on virus excretion (Leung <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0006"><title>Sampling</title><p>Virus detection is made with nasopharyngeal swabbing, which might cause the patient to sneeze, exposing the healthcare worker to infection. Throat swabbing is easier, but viral titres are lower (Zou <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), which leads to a lower sensitivity of the diagnostic test. Early morning saliva coughed up by clearing the throat after wake&#x02010;up, sampled by the test person and sent to a diagnostic centre is more sure. Viral titres paralleled those in endotracheal aspirates, albeit at a 10&#x02010;fold lower viral titre (To <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0007"><title>Triage</title><p>Models have been developed to decongest hospitals when the number of infected persons suddenly increases in an epidemic emergency. For mild and moderate COVID&#x02010;19 cases not in need of traditional hospital care, a novel hospital type was developed in China. Public buildings such as stadiums, exhibition centres, factories or warehouses were transformed into shelter hospitals. Construction time was 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;days, 12&#x02019;000 infected subjects found shelter at 19 locations in Wuhan. Due to a low health care to patient ratio, the maintenance cost and staff need was low and these &#x02018;Fangcang&#x02019; shelter hospitals could return to their original function after the emergency. Infected patients were thus separated from their uninfected families, received basic medical care, medication and food. Cases with worsening symptoms (13%) were transferred to higher level hospitals for more comprehensive care and recovered patients were discharged in a controlled manner, reducing virus transmission into the community and protecting hospitals from patient overflow (Chen <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2020d</xref>).</p><p>Italy became a hotspot of the COVID&#x02010;19 epidemic in Europe, pushing the healthcare system to a breaking point. In Milan, an emergency medical system was developed, where patients could call a response team that asks the patients about epidemiological risk factors, and about the severity of respiratory symptoms. According to an algorithm, the response team coordinates transport to a hospital by an ambulance, or opts for home isolation and domicile virus testing (Spina <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0008"><title>Telemedicine</title><p>In the United States, 29% of the physicians are older than 55&#x000a0;years. This experienced medical personnel also represents a vulnerable population for severe infections. Instead of being at the front line, this personnel might be better used for advising younger staff and helping in decision&#x02010;making (Buerhaus <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Telemedicine could represent a means to protect doctors in family practices, allowing the control of non&#x02010;severe COVID&#x02010;19 patients who remain at home or to ensure the follow&#x02010;up of stable patients after early hospital discharge. The legal and payment modes for commercial videoconference solutions, with end&#x02010;to&#x02010;end encryption, are currently being discussed (Keesara <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Robotics should be developed for disinfection of high&#x02010;risk, high&#x02010;touch areas; for diagnostic sample analysis; and for the surveillance of quarantine compliance; and for screening of subjects with elevated body temperature (Yang <italic>et al</italic>

Patients with a protracted disease course were elderly males with comorbidity, showing shortness of breath and the need for mechanical ventilation (Mo <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In Shanghai, 86% of patients were discharged after a median of 16&#x000a0;days of hospitalization and were virus&#x02010;negative after 12&#x000a0;days. All showed initial radiological evidence of pneumonia; 65% showed deterioration after 3&#x000a0;days, followed by an improvement in 95% after 6&#x000a0;days; 9% needed intensive care, and 1% died (Chen <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2020b</xref>). The role of computer tomography (CT) in case management is not yet clear, since after 2&#x000a0;days of symptomatic disease 56% had clear lungs by CT while also asymptomatic infected subjects could show CT lung abnormalities (Chua <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Notably, 11% of patients showed gut symptoms (diarrhoea &#x0003e;&#x000a0;vomiting) and were more severely affected than patients without diarrhoea (Jin et al., <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0011"><title>China: children</title><p>In Wuhan, a large number of children with exposure to COVID&#x02010;19 cases were followed: 12% became infected, but the clinical course was mild; 16% showed even no symptoms. Fever developed in 42% of them. Intubation was needed in three children with comorbidity, one child died (Lu <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In mainland China, 5% of cases were children. Half of them showed mild, or no, upper respiratory tract symptoms. Half had mild pneumonia. Dry cough and abnormal laboratory values were rare compared to adults. Virus excretion was also seen in asymptomatic cases, but was of shorter duration than in pneumonia cases (Qiu <italic>et al</italic>

Their infants, delivered by caesarian section, remained uninfected; amniotic fluid, cord blood and breastmilk from these women were virus&#x02010;negative (Chen <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2020a</xref>). In a second study from Wuhan, pregnant women showed mild pneumonia with fever as main symptom. Healthy children were born by caesarian section. One neonate showed a virus&#x02010;positive throat swab 36&#x000a0;h after birth, but developed only minor symptoms which resolved (Yu <italic>et al</italic>
<italic>.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In a third study, infants born by caesarian section to infected mothers showed no symptoms, were negative for the virus in nasopharynx and displayed passive IgG antibodies. Surprisingly, two infants also showed specific IgM antibodies to the virus (Zeng <italic>et al</italic>

If milder cases are incorporated into that calculation, CFR were reduced to 1.4% for COVID&#x02010;19 patients, which is still substantially higher than that of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. CFR showed a strong age dependency, with 6.4% for &#x0003e;&#x000a0;60&#x02010;year&#x02010;old, and 13.4% for &#x0003e;&#x000a0;80&#x02010;year&#x02010;old patients.

In Wuhan, hospital data from patients with definitive outcome of either death or hospital discharge were retrospectively analysed. Non&#x02010;survivors differed from survivors for comorbidity, specifically coronary heart disease (24 vs. 1%), hypertension (48% vs. 23%) and diabetes. An increased blood chemistry parameter of thrombosis (d&#x02010;dimer) was highly correlated with death. Sepsis was a common complication, but patients showed no bacterial co&#x02010;pathogen at admission (Zhou <italic>et al</italic>

These differences must be interpreted with caution, since there is no uniform system for calculating these rates (Lazzarini and Putoto, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The high CFR in Italy might result from a combination of several factors. One is differences in testing the population, affecting the denominator of CFR calculation. After becoming a public health emergency, only ill patients were tested in Italy, while in Korea a much wider range of contacts were tested, and asymptomatic infections were also included into the denominator, thus diluting the death rate (Onder <italic>et al</italic>

The negative outcome might be due to the late drug application in severely affected patients (mortality was 25% in the control group).

Temperature measurements of workers at factory gates and of commuters at subway entrances are installed, together with routine virus testing in all fever patients to prevent secondary flares of the epidemic in China by imported infections (Normile, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0021"><title>Mathematical models</title><p>Without control measures, the coronavirus epidemic led, in a model calculation within the first 50&#x000a0;days, to 740,000 infections in China. It was deduced that either the travel ban out of Wuhan or the emergence measures (school closure, case and contact isolation, travel restrictions) in mainland China could have reduced this number to 200&#x000a0;000 cases. The combination of both measures was responsible for the lesser toll of an estimated 30&#x000a0;000 cases in mainland China by Feb. 19 (Tian <italic>et al</italic>

Indeed, the spatial and temporal analysis of the Chinese epidemic showed that until Feb 10, the early epidemic in mainland China was well predicted according to the volume of infected human movement out of Wuhan alone. With sanitary measures taken in Wuhan, this correlation decreased and after the travel ban, local spread and public health counter&#x02010;measures determined the epidemic course in mainland China (Kraemer <italic>et al</italic>

According to a model from the London School of Hygiene, measures to reduce the mixing of the population (school closure, home confinement of the elderly, social distancing at work) have the potential to delay and flatten the epidemic course, allowing the health system to cope with hospitalizations. It is important to relax the restrictions stepwise to avoid emergence of secondary epidemics. With social restrictions, transmission shifts to home clusters and to healthcare professionals (Prem <italic>et al</italic>

With R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.5, 1.2 mio infections would be expected in this model calculation. With the quarantine of the infected person and of family members, school closures, workplace distancing (50% of workforce to work from home for 2&#x000a0;weeks) or all measures combined, the corresponding numbers of infected people would be 15&#x02019;000, 10&#x02019;000, 4&#x02019;000 and 1&#x02019;800 respectively (at R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.5). But at R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.5, even the combined measures could only decrease the number of cases of infection to 250&#x02019;000.

A 90% travel reduction delayed virus transmission to mainland China by 1&#x000a0;week, but did not cause case reduction if not combined with local hygiene measures. The impact of travel restriction from Wuhan was internationally greater, but epidemic growth resumed after 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks, since too many infected travellers remained undetected and had already seeded new epidemics (Chinazzi <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Crossing a critical threshold would have occurred on January 25 and January 28 without travel restriction and with travel restrictions respectively.

School closures are justified by the high surface density of subjects (3&#x02013;5 m<sup>2</sup>/child) compared to offices (18 m<sup>2</sup>/person) and homes (36 m<sup>2</sup>/person) (US data). School closure can, however, also increase mortality via the immobilization of healthcare personnel without alternate child care available (Bayham and Fenichel, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).

A coronavirus was also isolated from the lungs of two diseased pangolins, sharing up to 92% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2, but with a better binding to the human ACE&#x02010;2 virus receptor than the bat virus (Lam <italic>et al</italic>

Environmental samples from the wet market in Wuhan, where the epidemic originated, identified a virus closely related to the isolates from patients. Such a virus might have circulated as a &#x02018;cryptic&#x02019; infection for years in the human population before acquiring a critical mutation that started the current pandemic (Zhang and Holmes, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0029"><title>Virus mutation</title><p>Due to a proof&#x02010;reading viral enzyme, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is low for the standards of an RNA virus. Now SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 strains start to differentiate into two subtypes, S and L, with L being newer and now more frequent. There is no indication that this shift is linked to changes in biological properties. SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 is expected to accumulate 1&#x02013;2 mutation per month during epidemic circulation (Kupferschmidt, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).

The few sequence differences can be used for epidemiological analysis. For example, the first Italian COVID&#x02010;19 patient in Rome showed a virus sequence closely related to that of a Chinese tourist to Italy while a patient from Lombardy was most closely related to a virus isolated in Munich, suggestive of multiple introduction of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 into Italy (Giovanetti <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).

This study reported another important observation: COVID&#x02010;19 patients, when compared with bacterial pneumonia cases, lacked commensal bacteria in the lungs and showed nearly exclusively viral RNA.

Antibody titres did not correlate with disease severity (To <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It is safer to evaluate protective immunity based on neutralizing antibody determination than on antibodies determined with ELISA. The cell line VeroE6 was engineered to express the protease TMPRSS2, which assists viral entry into the cell, resulting in efficient infection of the cell line and production of high yields of SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2.

One group determined the 3D structure of the spike protein from SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 by cryo&#x02010;electron microscopy. It differs from SARS&#x02010;CoV (the coronavirus from the 2002 SARS epidemic, sharing the same cell receptor ACE&#x02010;2) over the receptor&#x02010;binding domain (RBD), allowing tighter binding to ACE&#x02010;2. Monoclonal antibodies directed to SARS&#x02010;CoV do not bind well to SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2, underlining distinct antigenicity. The proteolytic cleavage site (important for the fusion process mediating virus cell entry) is also different (Wrapp <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The viral spike protein presents its receptor&#x02010;binding domain (RBD) in two conformations, down and up. In its up position, RBD binds to the N&#x02010;terminal domain of the ACE&#x02010;2 dimer (Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The crystal structure of viral spike&#x02010;human receptor interaction was described by another group as a concave viral cup with a protruding ridge embracing closely the exposed N&#x02010;terminal end of the human ACE&#x02010;2 receptor. The novel coronavirus shows a larger binding interfacing, and more contacts to the receptor, than SARS&#x02010;CoV. The spike protein of a closely related bat coronavirus also mediated entry into cells via the ACE&#x02010;2 receptor. However, the bat spike protein was not cleaved upon entry, in contrast to SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 spike protein, which contains a target site for the protease furin (Lan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Shang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).

Due to amino acid and glycosylation differences between both viruses, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to SARS&#x02010;CoV binds only with 100&#x02010;fold lower affinity to the viral protein and lacks neutralizing activity against SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2 (Yuan et al., <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="mbt213592-sec-0034"><title>Antivirals</title><p>Two approaches, which were already used against SARS&#x02010;CoV, were also tested against SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2.

The impact of the current pandemic shows that we cannot expect guidance and rescue from an organization having a budget only equal to that of the University Hospital of Geneva (2.5 vs. 1.9 billion $, respectively), which must merely serve a canton in a small country.
