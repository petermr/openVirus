The latter, classified as patient 1, was asymptomatic when coming back from Germany to Codogno, his hometown, from where the infection exponentially spread to Bergamo, Lombardy, bordering regions and even further. After that he was diagnosed severe lung disease (which is typically characterized by dyspnea, respiratory rate&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;30/min, &#x0003c;3% blood oxygen saturation, and/or over 50% lung infiltrates), hospitalized in critical condition (mostly contributed by respiratory failure, septic, and multiple organ dysfunction) and kept in the ICU for 20&#x000a0;days.</p><p id="p0010">By fully recovering and coming back home just a few days ago, he became sort of a symbol and a source of hope for an entire population initially underestimating the seriousness of the epidemic and therefore reacting too slowly in the beginning. From then on, Italians followed the path already paved by the Chinese for two months, consisting of movement restriction and progressive shutdown of all non-essential activities <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

All this led to a total of 9134 deaths and 10,950 healings so far. We are aware that not all virus-positive people may be classified as severe cases because some 50% are either totally or partially asymptomatic and just isolated at home <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, as well as, that a public health problem arises from contagion being spread by infected subjects who have not been tested for SARS-CoV2 so far. The hidden transmission phenomenon seems to be especially serious for people suddenly moving from North- to South-Italy in mid-February to reach their families of origin or more comfortable and warmer country houses, just before stricter infection containment measures were taken. This resulted into several epidemic outbreaks all over Italy, which most likely might have been prevented by earlier more stringent nationwide restriction rules (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>

Tensile structures were also erected close to main emergency units to allow pre-triage activities, isolation and COVID-19 ward admission as needed and several military field hospitals were operationalized in the meanwhile <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0035">In addition, all GPs were alerted as a filter between the general population and hospitals to grant active surveillance, telemedicine services were set up to dematerialize prescriptions thus assuring a continuity of innovative drug delivery authorization as needed. Voluntary associations were also encouraged to provide fragile patients with specific drug delivery from temporarily unavailable institutional pharmacies. Finally, several factories started to reconvert in order to produce masks, suits, visors and breathing machines at the national levels to prevent present severe custom clearance problems from threatening health personnel and patient survival. Civil protection calculates needed masks, for instance, to be at least one million per month, i.e. much more than available, and unluckily this increasingly fast-spreading war already involved a number of law enforcement officers and health professionals (40 doctors and even more nurses were killed so far).</p><p id="p0040">Fortunately, all this triggered international solidarity, first of all from China - in terms of expert physicians and tons of medical supplies for our ICUs, followed Cuba, Russia and other countries. Scientific research has also been working hard against COVID-19 since the very beginning so that 20 new drugs and 35 vaccines are under evaluation by EMA <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0045">The Italian Drug Agency already triggered several clinical research studies involving remdesivir e tocimizulab and other drugs with originally different therapeutic indications, which - despite great expectations from the public &#x02013; wait for scientific validation for anti-coronavirus use <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="p0050">COVID-19 predominantly affects male gender and old age with comorbidities, including especially lung disease, arterial hypertension (AH) and diabetes mellitus (DM) <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Based on Chinese experience, 22% infected people suffered from cerebrovascular diseases, 24 to 12% from AH and 22 to 12% from DM, depending on reports. People on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors seemed to be at higher risk for clinically severe forms of infection. In fact, based on experimental <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, human pathogenic coronaviruses bind to target cells though angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and vessels <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> - and the expression of ACE2 is increased in patients with DM - especially those taking either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> - and in hypertensive people treated with ACE inhibitors (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, as well as, in patients using thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. Someone also hypothesized some contribution of an ACE2 polymorphisms linked to diabetes mellitus, stroke, and hypertension to genetic predisposition to SARS-CoV2 infection <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Such information spread fast thus causing serious alarm and anxiety among users worldwide, who urgently asked their own GPs to change antihypertensive prescriptions straight away. This was stopped, however, by a prompt reaction from most relevant international scientific societies interested to cardiovascular (CV) diseases, which reassured specialists on the absence of any EBM reasons to adopt such measures only on the basis of an experimentally driven hypothesis and alerted them on the CV risk increase caused by inappropriately discontinuing drugs endowed with well-defined and scientifically proven health benefits <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p id="p0055">Another issue is the possible role of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) in coronavirus infection that seems to be a further emerging issue as regards diabetes. In fact, Corona virus could bind to the human DPP-4 receptor. Kulcsar et al. used type 2 diabetic transgenic mouse models expressing DDP-4 receptor on pulmonary alveolar cells to study the effect of DM on MERS-coronavirus infection severity and, besides showing the latter to be longer-lasting and worse, found a significant association of DM with greater weight loss and pulmonary inflammation, with macrophage infiltrates similar to those seen clinically in the disease <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Further research is needed of course on that, especially in view of possible therapeutic benefits expected from exploiting DPP4-inhibitors in people with type 2 DM infected by SARS-CoV2.</p><p id="p0060">We should consider, anyway, that both common flu and respiratory tract infections are quite common during cold seasons and, even outside the present COVID-19 emergency, are associated with high morbidity and mortality among people with old age and/or chronic diseases <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p id="p0065">People with DM have been found to be prone to infectious diseases, especially those caused by bacteria and viruses and affecting lower airways <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

This latter consideration deserves special attention. A higher all-cause hospitalization risk observed in people with DM than in those of comparable age and gender due to the higher prevalence of HF (8%) and respiratory failure (6%) has been reported in clinical records during MERS-CoV <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and probably it is also the case for COVID-19.

As already outlined earlier, from available references except for Kui&#x02019;s report <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> the infection seems to mostly affect men. Based on available data, however, there is no possibility to assess whether or not this applies to the DM subpopulation. The percentage range of infected people having DM is 2% to 20% but all studies fail to specify disease type (1 or 2), level of glucose control, home treatment regimen and associated chronic complications. Two of them provide data on ICU admission rate for people with DM: 7.7% (1 out of 13, <italic>p&#x000a0;=</italic>&#x000a0;0.16) in Huang&#x02019;s report <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and 22.2% (8 out of 36, <italic>p&#x000a0;=</italic>&#x000a0;0.009) in Wang&#x02019;s report <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.

So, it has already been suggested that the management of glucose variability has to be part of the more comprehensive approach to the management of hyperglycemia today: it seems that this has to be urgently applied in intensive care units <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Even though we understand that in such a critic situation this request should be very hard to implement, we also believe that the best possible action to prevent a worse outcome is also essential in any medical act.</p><p id="p0110">On the other hand, we cannot forget that this situation due to COVID-19 pandemic is very difficult to face for any people with DM. Due to the restrictions applied by many Governments, the latter have to face hard challenges in getting the needed treatments as well as the required support by the specialists or other health care professionals. The seriousness of the epidemic has obviously triggered Associazione Medici Diabetologi (AMD) and Societ&#x000e0; Italiana Diabetologia (SID), two of the most relevant national scientific societies in the field, which immediately complemented the efforts of Italian Government by strengthening social distancing messages and providing guidelines for their members on how to handle clinical cases during the period <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. They also developed innovative strategies to reduce mortality risk of people with DM from the very beginning by preventing hospitalization as much as possible through a hotline to call for help <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and enhanced home management. To do so, they made a joint telemedicine effort to have several diabetologists available 7/7 days to take turn for on line advice for drug dosage adaptation needs or any other remotely manageable medical emergencies <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p id="p0115">In conclusion what can we say we have learned, or better are learning, from this dramatic experience?</p><p id="p0120">As it usually happens, the serious crisis we fell into has to be taken as a real chance for all of us to rethink our own lives, thus turning into moral, social and scientific rebirth for the entire hard-hearted world of today. Specifically, for people living with diabetes, the COVID-19 pandemic is even more complicating life. Our role is to do all our best to relieve those people, as much as possible, and, if they happen to be hospitalized, to guarantee them the best therapeutic options, which can be quite different from those to be used in people without diabetes.</p><sec id="s0005"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0125">The paper was supported by a non-conditioning special grant of NYX startup, Naples, Italy.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Authorship</title><p id="p0130">All authors meet the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship for this article, take responsibility for the integrity of the work as a whole, and that it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically, and have given their approval for this version to be published.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Authorship Contributions</title><p id="p0135">SG, and FS created the paper and wrote it, AC revised the text, and all approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><p id="p0140">Ours was a spontaneous, unconditioned study.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Ethical standard</title><p id="p0145">This study was conducted in conformance with good clinical practice standards.
