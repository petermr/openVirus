The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources. COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care. Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients. In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy. We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care. By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para250">The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented increase in the number of patients who are critically ill and require mechanical ventilation. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with lower mortality than the related viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, it has higher infectivity and rates of transmission.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> SARS-CoV-2 has spread far more widely and rapidly than these other viruses, resulting in catastrophic loss of life globally. Hospitals are overwhelmed, and medical professionals must make difficult decisions regarding the care of patients who are critically ill.</p><p id="para260">Tracheostomy is a common procedure in critically ill patients who require an extended period of time on mechanical ventilation. Use of tracheostomy can facilitate weaning from ventilation and potentially increase the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. When the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Italy and Spain, ICUs had a massive influx of patients who were critically ill, many of whom became candidates for tracheostomy. However, tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure, so health-care workers are at risk of infection during insertion and subsequent care, even when appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is used. Aerosol-generating procedures were identified as a leading cause of viral transmission during the SARS outbreak in 2003, with super-spreading events occurring throughout hospitals in Hong Kong, China, and Canada.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Reports of infections related to aerosol-generating procedures have also emerged in the current pandemic.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para270">Although global community-based strategies to manage the impact of COVID-19 are a priority for the general population, tracheostomy is one of a number of important clinical considerations for the optimal management of patients who are critically ill during the pandemic.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> We aim to provide authoritative guidance for health-care providers and health-care systems, highlighting the range of considerations for tracheostomy during the current COVID-19 pandemic, by synthesising experience, currently available evidence, and lessons from history. Owing to the urgent need for guidance and the lack of robust ICU outcome data, we make pragmatic recommendations and suggestions primarily on the basis of international, multidisciplinary expert opinion.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>COVID-19 in the context of previous epidemics</title><p id="para280">In response to the threat of Avian influenza, caused by the influenza A H5N1 virus, in 2005, a great deal of pandemic preparedness planning began, with a view not only to treating patients, but also to mitigating the spread of a lethal and easily transmitted respiratory infection. Some of these methods would only be required in worst-case scenarios, such as that seen during the influenza pandemic of 1918&#x02013;19, because they are socially and economically disruptive. The hypothesis behind community mitigation has now become popularly known as &#x0201c;flattening the curve&#x0201d;.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> By delaying the peak of the epidemic, less strain is put on health-care capacity, and the burden on hospitals and infrastructure is reduced. In turn, the overall case numbers and health impacts might be reduced, allowing more time for the development of better medical therapies and preventive vaccines. An evaluation of these strategies in the context of the 1918&#x02013;19 influenza pandemic indicated that cities that acted early had much lower morbidity and mortality than those that did not.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para290">As we apply these community mitigation strategies on a global level that has never been seen before in human history, future evaluation will determine their effect on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracheostomy was an essential clinical strategy for managing epidemics associated with respiratory failure during the 20th century, including those of poliomyelitis and diptheria,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and we hope that the careful conduct and management of tracheostomy during the current pandemic will help to reduce the impact of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="cesec30"><title>Methods</title><p id="para300">We (BAM, MJB, SJW, VP, AA, NT, and DJF-K) recruited and convened an international tracheostomy consensus working group by identifying individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy and previous experience in the development of guidelines or consensus documents. The group has international, multidisciplinary representation, including critical care, anaesthesiology, pulmonology, otolaryngology, nursing, respiratory (physio) therapy, speech and language pathology, virology and immunology, medical ethics, medical history, and patient and family stakeholders.</p><p id="para310">The project scope was determined through a review of available consensus statements on tracheostomy care (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 4&#x02013;7</xref>). We did a literature and internet search to identify and extract data from primary sources, and gathered first-hand accounts of tracheostomy during the current pandemic from discussion among working group members. We gathered additional information by dissemination of targeted questions and data collection forms, and a Qualtrics-XM survey (SAP Walldorf, Germany) that allowed for ranking, scoring, and free-text response completed by members of the consensus working group (the survey is registered with the Institutional Review Board in compliance with University of Michigan institutional policy [HUM00182021]).</p><p id="para320">The consensus working group recommendations in this Health-care Development paper are expert opinions (denoted by &#x0201c;we suggest&#x0201d; throughout the paper) informed by the best available evidence, or published supporting statements (denoted by &#x0201c;we recommend&#x0201d;). We used an iterative approach, adapted from the Delphi method, to prioritise topics for inclusion and to reach consensus on recommendations. The first round consisted of a core writing group (BAM, MJB, SJW, VP, AA, NT, and DJF-K) that drafted distinct statements as part of the paper, making recommendations on case selection, timing, performance of tracheostomy, and management after tracheostomy, on the basis of the primary data sources retrieved. These recommendations were circulated among all consensus working group members, inviting both opinion and any additional recommendations. The second round involved circulating all new recommendations received, along with those recommendations from the first round that had received favourable comment from the majority (over half) of the respondents (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 2&#x02013;3</xref>). A final review of the recommendations was made during a videoconference, which included 29 of the group members, followed by electronic correspondence and telephone discussions, facilitating iterative review and refinement over three rounds to achieve consensus agreement for the content of this paper.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Patient selection for tracheostomy</title><p id="para330">First we considered the role of tracheostomy in critical illness and respiratory failure. Approximately 8&#x02013;13% of patients admitted to modern ICUs who require mechanical ventilation have a tracheostomy.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The major indication for tracheostomy remains the facilitation of mechanical ventilation for a long period, while minimising complications from a translaryngeal endotracheal tube and weaning from ventilation. Tracheostomy might also be required for actual or threatened airway obstruction, laryngeal oedema (which might be an emerging feature of COVID-19)<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> or unsuccessful extubation due to weakness, poor cough, tenacious secretions, or a combination of these factors. Decision making around access to critical care and tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic is based mainly on existing standards of practice, although the evidence base for tracheostomy timing in those who are critically ill is not substantial.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Tracheostomy in the context of critical illness is not always in the patient's best interests. Among patients without COVID-19 who require tracheostomy after an extended period of mechanical ventilation, at least half do not survive for more than 1 year, and at 1 year fewer than 12% are at home and functionally independent.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Similarly, tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19 might not always be beneficial, and the procedure and subsequent care puts health-care workers at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients and surrogates need information and discussion in the context of a multidisciplinary team about trade-offs, challenges, and the outcomes of tracheostomy; that tracheostomy in this context will often be followed by long periods of functional dependency and rehabilitation should be explained. These decisions might become more important in an overwhelmed health-care system with few resources to care for patients who are critically ill, recovering, or highly dependent. Although rationing in health care is not unprecedented, in the modern age we have never before been faced with the prospect of having to ration medical goods and services on such a large scale. Decision makers might have to consider the appropriateness of embarking on a tracheostomy, with the associated health-care resources, in the context of shortages of staff, equipment, medications, and facilities. An independent triage or ethics committee could help to guide decisions, communicate with patients and their relatives, and reduce the burden on frontline staff.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>

When elective tracheostomy is done, an inflated tracheostomy tube cuff via which pressure support ventilation can be delivered affords a closed system for controlled weaning of respiratory support. Although tracheostomy is associated with risks of infectious transmission, a primary extubation strategy in patients for whom the likelihood of success is low also carries risk. Several members of the consensus working group have personally been involved with or are aware of challenging re-intubations in patients with COVID-19, which suggests a role for mitigating risks of urgent or emergency re-intubation in difficult circumstances. Data are needed to understand attendant risks of infectious exposure to staff and other patients. Therapies for unsuccessful extubation, such as high-flow oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure, or non-invasive ventilation, generate hazardous aerosols to varying degrees and might not be appropriate; they also impose a strain on the capacity of hospital wards to deliver oxygen.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Recovering patients who continue to require ventilatory support via a tracheostomy can be managed with minimal sedation, which might simplify care and facilitate transfer to lower-acuity facilities, thus creating capacity for more acute patients.</p><p id="para420">Although tracheostomy is of benefit for carefully selected patients recovering from COVID-19-associated pneumonitis, we do not recommend the procedure in recovering patients who still need high fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>), have high ventilator requirements, and might require prone positioning as part of their ventilatory strategy. Patients with tracheostomy can be managed in the prone position, but the airway cannot be visualised, risking displacement and pressure damage. Clear decision making is important in patients who are recovering, with the options including primary extubation with or without a plan for re-intubation, a tracheostomy or, in some cases, palliation. Ensuring adequate PPE, to maintain the safety of the health-care team, is among the foremost considerations in decisions around the management of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. Notably, COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome can be characterised by vascular insult and disrupted vasoregulation, which can affect the critical care strategy, and the need for tracheostomy might be reduced with high-quality ICU care that considers the characteristic pathophysiology.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Based on case series and expert opinion, we suggest that tracheostomy be delayed until at least day 10 of mechanical ventilation and considered only when patients are showing signs of clinical improvement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>Performance of tracheostomy</title><sec id="cesec90"><title>Optimal setting for tracheostomy insertion</title><p id="para430">A variety of logistical and practical considerations influence the optimal location for a tracheostomy procedure in patients who are critically ill, including operator training and expertise; hospital infrastructure, including provision of side rooms and negative pressure air flows; availability of staff and equipment; and the ability to transfer a patient who is critically ill to another setting.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Tracheostomy can be done in the ICU (often with suboptimal equipment and lighting, restricted availability of assistants, and suboptimal positioning on wide ICU beds) or in the operating room (requiring transfer from the ICU, exposure risks to multiple staff, and associated logistics).

Of the published cases of tracheostomies done in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Canada during the SARS outbreak, hospitals used enhanced PPE measures in addition to standard PPE, ranging from face shields to powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> On the basis of these reports, we suggest the use of enhanced PPE, with PAPRs, eye protection, fluid-repellent disposable surgical gown, and gloves. If a PAPR is not available, we advise the use of a fit-tested filtering face piece 3 (FFP3) or N95 mask with an additional fluid shield. The number of personnel present should be kept to an absolute minimum, with the most experienced operator and anaesthetist present. The team should prepare, rehearse, simulate, and communicate effectively.</p><p id="para450">The tracheostomy technique is determined by local expertise and resources.

Single-use bronchoscopes with a sealed ventilator circuit are preferable when doing percutaneous tracheostomies.</p><p id="para460">When using an open approach, we suggest maintenance of a bloodless field, minimal use of diathermy, and use of a smoke evacuator. No definitive evidence exists regarding the relative superiority of any technique in minimising infectivity or complications in patients on anticoagulants, including those given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Whichever technique is used, careful choice of tracheostomy tube and meticulous assessment of position once inserted are essential to minimise risks of later displacement, especially in patients who are obese.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>

Adjunctive manoeuvres such as placing the inflated cuff of the endotracheal tube well below the tracheostomy site in surgical tracheostomy can minimise the duration of apnoea. Because apnoea can cause rapid and substantial hypoxia in patients who are critically ill and dependent on a ventilator, we suggest preoxygenation, followed by a trial of apnoea in the ICU, with an FiO<sub>2</sub> of 1&#x000b7;0 and positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, in a patient in a supine position before tracheostomy. Rapid desaturation during these trials predicts a similar response during tracheostomy, indicating risks to the patient (and also to staff who might be required to do unplanned or additional airway interventions) and tracheostomy should be deferred. The ability to conduct or tolerate an apnoea trial should not replace multidisciplinary clinical judgment regarding the risks and benefits of undertaking tracheostomy in a given patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cesec110"><title>Optimal management after tracheostomy</title><p id="para490">Care of patients with COVID-19 after tracheostomy extends from the same fundamental principles of tracheostomy care in all patients.

Increases in the number of patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill can swiftly overwhelm hospitals, particularly because many require extended periods of ventilator support, and many will require tracheostomy to facilitate recovery. Globally, studies of the COVID-19 pandemic have a recurring theme: foresight and planning save lives, whereas inadequate preparedness is associated with overwhelmed health systems.
