There is no therapeutic FDA-approved drug against SARS-CoV-2 infection, although a combination of anti-viral drugs is directly being practiced in some countries. A broad-spectrum of antiviral agents are being currently evaluated in clinical trials, and in this review, we specifically focus on the application of Remdesivir (RVD) as a potential anti-viral compound against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) -CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. First, we overview the general information about SARS-CoV-2, followed by application of RDV as a nucleotide analogue which can potentially inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of COVs. Afterwards, we discussed the kinetics of SARS- or MERS-CoV proliferation in animal models which is significantly different compared to that in humans. Finally, some ongoing challenges and future perspective on the application of RDV either alone or in combination with other anti-viral agents against CoVs infection were surveyed to determine the efficiency of RDV in preclinical trials. As a result, this paper provides crucial evidence of the potency of RDV to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p><p>Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The disease known as CoV diseases-19 (COVID-19) appears to induce a mortality rate of less than 2%, which is lesser that of most epidemics that have ever become global headlines (Dong et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Pan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). CoVs are very similar to influenza viruses and show almost identical symptoms (Heymann &#x00026; Shindo, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Rothan &#x00026; Byrareddy, <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Two recent outbreaks of the new CoV, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have originated from animals (Gretebeck &#x00026; Subbarao, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Song et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Yao et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The diseases caused by these viruses were extremely fatal to humans, and very few cases were reported as mild or asymptomatic. However, it has been reported that the mortality rate of COVID-19 has been more than that of SARS and MERS (Mahase, <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Peeri et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>In the past days, it has been repeatedly reported that a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, but vaccines, like other medicines, require a lengthy testing process to be approved for medical applications (Ahmed et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Chen et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Prompetchara et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). One strategy to date is the replication of a piece of virus RNA that could one day serve as a vaccine (Enayatkhani et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Although, well-developed DNA sequencing devises has let to rapid genetic sequencing, vaccine development is costly, complex, and time intensive (Plotkin et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This includes finding a viral sequence that, while providing memory to the immune system, does not lead to an acute inflammatory reaction. Achieving this goal requires laboratory experimentation on animal models before subjecting humans. In addition, once the vaccine is discovered, it is not possible to dispatch the sample quickly and easily worldwide. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies have generally found it more profitable to invest in drugs that are used for chronic medical conditions. The CoV, as in case of influenza, may undertake mutations and therefore would require continuous vaccine development.</p><p>With Having a considerable number of people worldwide infected with COVID-19, scientists have identified a number of cases of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) that could serve as potential candidates for the treatment of the viral diseases (Andersen et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Ianevski et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Indeed, re-purposing of current approved anti-viral drugs could be a solution to treat new viral infections (Guo, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Kouznetsova et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mercorelli et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Xu et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Drug re-purposing means that by examining existing drugs, they will find therapeutic effects on new diseases (Aggarwal et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Khan, Jha, et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Senathilake et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). BSAAs are small molecules that can inhibit different infections by blocking the viral replication (Pant et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Xiong et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Xu et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These drugs block the virus or host-related factors and thus prevent the virus from proliferating, then lowering the level of the virus in the body to an extent that the immune system can inhibit their infection (Cui et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Ji &#x00026; Li, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). BSAA has received special attention with the emergence of numerous new viral diseases. Re-purposing existing drugs, or even rejected drugs, for viral diseases increases the possibility of market success as well as reducing the costs and time required to launch it. The benefit of drug re-purposing is that drug details, such as the stages of chemical synthesis, mass production processes, various stages of clinical trials and many more have been identified beforehand (Aanouz et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Gupta et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>There is currently no drug or vaccine to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the use of widespread antivirals can be effective against the prophylaxis of this virus (Boopathi et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Elmezayen et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). For example, chloroquine and remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) are two drugs that in&#x000a0;vitro studies have suggested that they can inhibit the viral replication (Wang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Teicoplanin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, and monensin antibiotics also prevent viral replication (Andersen et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Currently, the BSAAs are treatment or pyrophylaxis candidates against SARS-CoV-2 (Senanayake, <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, a combination of BSAAs can be applied against a wider range of viruses, such as those that are not yet well recognized or drug-resistant viruses (Wang, Cao, et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Potential clinical trials are currently being conducted on these drugs and their results will be published soon (Li &#x00026; De Clercq, <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Senanayake, <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Perhaps in a near future, BSAAs will be used to treat COVID-19 patients. Although a number of BS have been reported to date, in this review we focused on the RDV as a potential compound that has been assessed on the animal models and reaches the clinical phase against MERS -CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>General information on SARS-CoV-2</title><p>CoVs are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold virus to the cause of SARS (Cascella et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Paules et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The structure of CoV has a common RNA genome and is classified as enveloped viruses (Mackie, <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 originating in China and the city of Wuhan is believed to be a member of the Corona family, which has infected many people to date (Lai et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Despite the emergence of the virus in China, it is spreading rapidly to other parts of the world (Lai et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhu et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Similar cases have been reported in other countries such as Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and the United States, and even more recently in Iran (Velavan &#x00026; Meyer, <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhu et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The disease can be spread through close contact with the infected person, handling contaminated equipment and airborne outbreaks (Velavan &#x00026; Meyer, <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Most people with hypertension, diabetes, respiratory problems, and weak immune systems are at the higher risk to infection and the likely death from it (Fang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>CoVs have four types of proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Hasan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). S protein is attached to the virus membrane and play an important role in binding and entry into the host cell; hence, targeting this protein with various drugs and inhibitors is one potential approach to combat these types of viruses (Chatterjee, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lai &#x00026; Cavanagh, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Woo et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 has proteins on its surface that mediate viral infection by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (Batlle et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Chen &#x00026; Hao, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Therefore, one promising way to stop infection by SARS-CoV-2 is to find a compound that blocks the receptor, and consequently prevent the infection by preventing the interaction of S protein with ACE2 receptor (Andersen et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Joshi et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The CoV also has 16 unstructured protein (Nsp 1-16) encoded by ORF1a/1b which act as important co-factors for activation of viral replication enzymes (Guo et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Some specifications such as origin, transmission and clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2.

Researches into the origin of SARS outbreaks have led to the discovery of many bat viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to this category of SARS-related viruses (Fung et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The two genome sequences of <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic> show 80% similarity with SARS-CoV-2. The third genome of the <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> virus, RaTG13, resembles 96% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). To have better sense of this variation, it is similar to the rate of mutation observed over ten years in the human H3N2 influenza virus strain (Wang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Remdesivir</title><p>RDV (GS-5734) as a nucleotide analogue was originally developed to treat Ebola (Tchesnokov et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The laboratory assessments has shown that RDV is effective against SARS-CoV (Ju et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and MERS-CoV (Gordon et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) viruses, therefore it can be used as a potential anti-viral agent against SARS-CoV-2 (Khan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The mechanism of RDV&#x02019;s anti-viral function is based on the blockage of viral RNA transcription as revealed in molecular examinations using different recombinant viral polymerases (Jordan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Sarma et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Tchesnokov et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Warren et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Siegel et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) reported that GS-5734 can be used as a potential candidate for the treatment of Ebola and emerging CoV. Agostini et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) reported that CoV is susceptible to the RDV targeting the viral polymerase and the nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN). They compared the sensitivity of WT and ExoN (-) virus to RDV, which ExoN (-) virus showed a greater decrease in viral titer in the presence of GS-5734 relative to WT virus and the determined EC<sub>50</sub> value for ExoN (-) virus was around 0.019&#x02009;M, whereas the EC<sub>50</sub> value for to the WT was determined to be 0.087&#x02009;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2A</xref>(i)). This increased inhibition of ExoN (-) virus by GS-5734 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2A</xref>(ii)) indicated that GS-5734 is integrated into viral genome and can be excluded by ExoN (Agostini et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Also, it was shown that the type of CoV, concentration of antiviral drug, type of anti-viral drug, and incubation time can play an important role on the inhibition of virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2B</xref>(i&#x02013;iii).</p><fig id="F0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>(A) ExoN (-) virus are more sensitive to anti-viral drug.

(<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) revealed that RDV derives anti-viral effects against MERS-CoV though inhibition of RNA polymerase. As with SARS-CoV investigations treated by RDV, similar outcomes were observed for MERS-CoV along with limited weight loss, increased pulmonary activity and decreased virus replication (Sheahan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Kinetic of CoV proliferation</title><p>The kinetics of SARS- or MERS-CoV proliferation in animal models is significantly different compared to that in humans. In animal, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV proliferation in the lung tissue reaches to the maximum at 2&#x02009;dpi and mortality is stimulated at 7&#x02013;10&#x02009;dpi (Douglas et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Sheahan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Thus, the therapeutic window to control infected animal model prior to the peak of CoV proliferation is less than 2&#x02009;days. In human, MERS-CoV replication in the lung tissue reaches the maximum at 7&#x02013;10&#x02009;days after the onset of infections and the disease severity increases to death within &#x0223c;21&#x02009;days (Choi et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Oh et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, the time for therapeutic handling is substantially divergent in humans and experimentally infected animal models. Although, applying RDV led to a reduction in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and pronounced decrease in viral dose, therapeutic handling did not thoroughly reduce infection. Furthermore, at high levels of CoV, RDV is unable to sustain viral viability and pulmonary cells functionality, despite of remarkable decrease in viral loads. These outcomes are the same as those reported for SARS-CoV, where therapeutic platforms were launched after the peak of virus titer and lung injury did not show any progress in resultant outcomes (Sheahan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Since SARS- and MERS-CoV infections are controlled by both CoVs and host immune system modulators, therefore early handling of antiviral therapeutics either solely or in combination with other therapeutic drugs, and based on the stage of the disorder progression, can inhibit virus proliferation and immunopathology, switch on repairing systems, or control the pulmonary homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Current challenges and future opportunities</title><p>Arising viral disorders have resulted in meaningful catastrophic pandemics. Genetic exploration in animal models have shown a pronounced mutation of viral genome in the case of CoV, and have even pointed out some viruses indistinguishable to ongoing and past pathogenic strains in animals (Ge et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Woo et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of FDA-approved therapeutics for reducing the human CoV infection, useful broad-spectrum therapeutic platforms against well-known epidemic and zoonotic strains probably pave a way for diminishing the current epidemic diseases.</p><p>In the case of CoV, patients were received off-label anti-viral drugs as well as immunomodulators, either solely or combined, to reduce severe disease symptoms (Zumla et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, due to the lack of patient, therapeutic consistency, and verified standard efficiency measurement is a complicated process. Although interferon does not result in improved clinical consequence in MERS-CoV patients (Morra et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), a fixed dose combination of lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon &#x003b2; is efficient to reduce MERS-CoV infections (Arabi et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Muralidharan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Sheahan et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) showed that RDV stimulated superior anti-viral function against MERS-CoV both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> in comparison with lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon &#x003b2;.</p><p>Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues inhibit virus replication by blocking the activity of the polymerase enzyme in the virus (Chhikara et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Men&#x000e9;ndez-Arias et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The usage of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is a major step in the treatment of patients infected with CoVs due to the appropriate antiviral response (Chhikara et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, the application of these drugs may lead to genetic variation and subsequent mutation emergence. Hence, the safety of RDV and its broad-spectrum anti-viral activity should be considered before suggesting them as potential alternative candidates for clinical development.</p><p>Over the recent years, animal model progression of RDV seems to orient primarily on CoV respiratory infections (Sheahan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Clinical trials in selective patient populations with CoV or CoV-like diseases are needed to examine the efficacy of the developed drugs. Regarding safety data for RDV, some necessary studies in COVID-19 patients should be conducted to proceed the clinical trials. Studies over CoV-like diseases will probably require the enrollment of a large number of infected patients.</p><p>There is currently no approved antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 to treat hospitalized patients. Moreover, clinical trials over COVID-19 patients seems to be complicated due to several factors such as inability to apply a placebo, underlying diseases, and evaluating anti-viral drug efficiency. If the synergistic activity of RDV and other anti-viral agents in cell cultures is approved by the current Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with SARS-CoV-2, the outcome may propose a way for developing and performing clinical trials of the relative integration to RDV monotherapy and other anti-viral drug monotherapy for treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19.</p><p>Ongoing and future perspectives are trying to determine the resistance of different CoVs to RDV both <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>, and to elucidate whether the mutational strains behave in a same way as wild types.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusion and perspective</title><p>Due to the emergence of a new respiratory infections such as the SARS-CoV-2, progression of animal studies and subsequent preclinical and clinical trials are required to explore the activity of RDV. Some preclinical explorations are ongoing to examine the potential of the RDV against the SARS-CoV-2. Given application history of RDV in treating a wide range of infections, as well as the outcomes from clinical trials in patients with SARS-and MERS-CoV, reinforces the rationale for additional trials of RDV against a wider range of infectious including COVID-19. The ongoing studies in SARS-CoV-2 supported by the WHO is expected to furnish potential data corresponding to RDV application in treating COVID-19.</p><p>Other similar investigations may be envisioned with respect to the increasing identifications of the importance of CoVs as a driving force of COVID-19. Apart from the potential progression of RDV for treating SARS- and MERS-CoVs, the emergence of other viral illnesses may pave the way for clinical trials of RDV derivatives.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0007"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Aanouz</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Belhassan</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>El Khatabi</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Lakhlifi</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>El Idrissi</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name>, &#x00026; <name name-style="western"><surname>Bouachrine</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2020</year>). <article-title>Moroccan medicinal plants as inhibitors of COVID-19: Computational investigations</article-title>. <source><italic>Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics</italic></source>, <fpage>1</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>12</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/07391102.2020.1758790</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Aggarwal</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Leser</surname><given-names>G.
