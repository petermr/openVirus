 <p>The breakthrough of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, a city of China, has damaged the status of health and quality of life. In the sequel of this epidemic or contagious disease, the patient experiences fever, chest paint, chills, a rapid heartbeat, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, and kidney failure. It has been suggested that this disease can spread through human-to-human transmission or by super spreading. By the help of the non-invasive fluid “saliva”, it is easy to detect the virus. This can help with the comfort of the patient as well as healthcare personnel. Under this perspective, we discuss the epidemic situation of 2019-nCOV and its relationship with human saliva.</p>
