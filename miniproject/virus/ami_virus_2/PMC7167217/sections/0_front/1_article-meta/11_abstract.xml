 <p>Novel coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens, but the first human-to-human transmission has been reported. CoVs have the best known genome of all RNA viruses, and mutations in the genome have now been found. A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China on 31 December 2019. This study aims to report early findings related to COVID-19 and provide methods to prevent and treat it. </p>
