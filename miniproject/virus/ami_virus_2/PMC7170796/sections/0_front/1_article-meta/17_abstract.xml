  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Viruses are one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. Early identification of respiratory viruses could result in a decrease in the use of antibiotics.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Observational, retrospective study from January 2014 to June 2018, that included paediatric patients admitted with a diagnosis of CAP in a tertiary hospital, in which antigenic tests and/or viral PCR on a respiratory sample was performed.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>A total of 105 CAP episodes were included, with identification of a respiratory virus in 93 (88.6%) cases. Patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection had a lower onset of empirical antibiotic therapy (35.1% vs. 55.9%, 
   <italic>p</italic>-value = .042). In addition, cases with RSV or influenza identification required shorter duration of antibiotic therapy (receiving 45.6% ≥2 days vs. 68.8% of those not identified, 
   <italic>p</italic> = .017).

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>The use of respiratory virus diagnostic techniques in our setting can optimise antibiotic use in children admitted with CAP.</p>
