  <title>Background and aims</title>
  <p>The last two decades have experienced the outbreaks of three different coronaviruses in the different parts of the world namely; Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome cornonavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to delineate the differences in viral dynamics and clinical features between them and tried to focus on every basic details of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) that every health care provider must know.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>We systematically searched the PubMed database up till April 2, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV that dealt with viral dynamics.</p>

 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Ample data is available to suggest the differences in etiology, transmission cycle, diagnosis, genetics, hosts, reproductive rates, clinical features, laboratory diagnosis and radiological features between SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Although SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is more infectious than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, most infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, case-fatality rates are very high in patients with COVID-19 with comorbidities, compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.</p>
