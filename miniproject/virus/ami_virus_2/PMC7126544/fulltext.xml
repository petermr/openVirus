This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002&#x02013;2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><p id="p0010">&#x02022;The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2, and is the cause of the disease named COVID-19.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><p id="p0015">&#x02022;COVID-19 is the third severe epidemic caused by coronaviruses in the past 20 years.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><p id="p0020">&#x02022;It is believed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated from bats, based on genomic sequencing.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><p id="p0025">&#x02022;While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 is far more deadly, with a mortality rate around 2.3%.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><p id="p0030">&#x02022;As of February 19th, 2020, there have been 75,282 confirmed cases and 2012 deaths worldwide.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0035"><p id="p0035">&#x02022;Lessons learned from SARS in 2003 resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0040"><p id="p0040">&#x02022;Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes are critical to stemming spread of the virus.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0045"><p id="p0045">&#x02022;Pyroptosis, a novel form of inflammatory cell death, is a possible mechanism for the increased virulence of the SARS-CoV-2.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Pneumonia</kwd><kwd>Flu</kwd><kwd>Bats</kwd><kwd>Human to human transmission</kwd><kwd>Epidemic</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd><kwd>Pyroptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0050">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface and belong to the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses broadly infect vertebrates including humans, birds, bats, snakes, mice and other wild animals [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since the mid-1960s, seven known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Four commonly detected HCoVs are 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1.

Another epidemiological study in adults estimates that coronavirus causes about 15% of common colds [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other significant causes of upper respiratory infections include influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Group A Streptococci, EBV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</p><p id="p0055">The three other strains of HCoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have a different pathogenicity and lead to higher mortality rates in human populations. MERS-CoV was isolated from a male patient who died from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and was subsequently responsible for 2494 cases and 858 deaths from 27 different countries (case-fatality rate: 34.4%) [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were first recognized in China. SARS-CoV caused a total of 8422 probable SARS cases, 919 SARS-related deaths (case-fatality rate: 11%) and spread to 32 different countries or regions between November 2002 and August 2003 [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has infected 73,230 people and caused 1871 deaths (case-fatality rate: 2.6%) and has spread to 25 countries, according to the State Council Information Office in Beijing, China (updated as of Feb. 17, 2020) [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As of this date, the number of confirmed and suspected cases is still increasing, as is the number of deaths, although there is a significant increase in the number of recovered patients as well.</p><p id="p0060">Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s. It is not known for how long they have existed. Most of the time they are associated with mild disease, but every few years a highly virulent strain appears. The pathogenesis of these deadly epidemics is unclear. An examination of the structure of the viruses and the mechanism of infection may help elucidate and provide information for the development of effective treatment and possibly vaccines. Our purpose of this review is to provide a brief summary of the epidemiology and history of SARS, as well as the lessons learned. The other aim is to review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to better understand this deadly coronavirus and suggest prevention, treatment and management strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Characteristics of coronaviruses and coronavirus infections</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Biology of the coronaviruses</title><p id="p0065">CoVs are enveloped with a non-segmented, positive-sense, single-strand RNA, with size ranging from 26,000 to 37,000 bases.

The earliest patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan ultimately caused the epidemic known as COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Some of these patients had a history of contact with a wholesale seafood market in the early stages, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Subsequently, a large number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to the markets, suggesting the development of person-to-person spread [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>].</p><p id="p0075">There are three primary ways to transmit the virus, including close person-to-person contact, aerosol transmission, and transmission by touch [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. The virus is thought to be transmitted to other people by respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing. Droplet spread can occur when an infected person sneezes or coughs, whereupon virus containing droplets are propelled up to 3 feet through the air and are deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. A recent report suggests that transmission through the ocular surface is also possible [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The other avenues for the spread of the virus are shaking hands with an infected person, touching an infected object/surface, frequent touching of the nose or mouth or coming into contact with a patient's excreta. Another avenue is through &#x0201c;hidden transmission&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in which asymptomatic infected individuals or carriers unknowingly transmit the virus to unsuspecting contacts.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Variability of clinical presentation</title><p id="p0080">Before the first outbreak of SARS, a limited number of HCoVs such as HCoV-229E were frequently found to infect humans, and were widely circulating in human populations causing only mild illnesses like the common cold [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Early on, these patients are usually treated with conventional medications which had no clinical benefit, resulting in spread to health care personnel. For those with flu-like symptoms or even more severe disease, it would not be immediately evident that this is an atypical and virulent form of a coronavirus. For comparison, influenza has an estimated mortality rate of 0.07%&#x02013;0.2%.

This highly contagious atypical pneumonia first appeared in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. The initial cases were animal handlers in Guangzhou city having close contact with wild game food. It was suggested that civets could serve as an intermediate amplification host. Three months later, the SARS pandemic was rapidly and globally disseminated due to person-to-person transmission of the virus. On the February 21, 2003, a medical professor from Foshan in Guangdong province who was considered a &#x0201c;super-spreader&#x0201d; went to Hong Kong to visit his relatives. During his stay in Hong Kong, he transmitted the virus to 2 family members, 4 health care workers (HCWs) and 12 other nearby residents. Because of international travel and transmission to HCWs, these patients spread the SARS-CoV to Hong Kong and other countries including Vietnam, Singapore and Canada. Eventually, 8422 people were infected in 32 countries and 919 (11%) died [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, basic research on coronaviruses and advances in vaccine preparation technology can significantly shorten the development time of new coronavirus vaccines. However, the difficulties and challenges of developing an effective vaccine have been discussed earlier, and the key to a successful vaccine program is to vaccinate people before an outbreak occurs, not begin to develop the vaccine during the outbreak. Development of animal models that faithfully mimic SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is critical not only in providing a more refined understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved but also to serve as a screening model for potential chemotherapeutic agents and vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="sec13"><label>13</label><title>Guidelines for the future</title><p id="p0475">Recommendations for the prevention and management of coronavirus epidemics are summarized in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>
. Since both SARS and SARS-CoV-2 appear to have an exotic animal origin, the purchase, trafficking, and sale of wild animals should be banned, and illegal activities should be prosecuted. Early recognition of the problem, early identification of infected patients and early mobilization of healthcare resources are critical in limiting morbidity and mortality. When an outbreak occurs, it is very important to rapidly identify and characterize the pathogen, in order to be able to develop diagnostic assays. In the early stage of the disease epidemic, summarizing the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy, formulating the diagnosis procedures, defining suspected cases and locations, determining transmission patterns, isolating contagious patients and formulating the appropriate quarantine strategy are all necessary and need to be implemented promptly.<fig id="fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Keys to the control of future hCoV epidemics.

In addition, actively mobilizing the population to participate in epidemic prevention and control is critical, and this can be achieved by accurate information dissemination and ongoing updates. Real-time updating the information of the epidemic situation can help to alleviate panic and reduce societal anxiety. A strong public health surveillance system to guide the response to the outbreak is important in the face of a lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines. Big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information, conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks. Last but not least, use of the Internet and the media to conduct health education for the people, publicize the correct knowledge of prevention, and offer online consultation to guide patients to seek medical treatment correctly are additional strategies that can be implemented to achieve viral containment.</p></sec><sec id="sec14"><label>14</label><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec14.1"><label>14.1</label><title><italic>The differences between SARS and</italic> SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="p0485">Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have certain similarities in biological, epidemiological and pathological characteristics, there are some important differences. First, the most fundamental difference between the two viruses lies in their gene sequence. Second, during the SARS epidemic, a total of 8422 patients worldwide were infected with SARS-CoV, of whom 919 died, with a mortality rate of 9.5% [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A total of 5328 patients in China were infected with SARS-CoV, of whom 349 died, with a mortality rate of 6.5% [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

Compared to SARS, there are more confirmed cases, suspected cases and deaths of SARS-CoV-2, but the mortality rate is lower than that of SARS.</p><p id="p0490">From 2017 to 2018, influenza ravaged the world, affecting up to 45 million people and killing about 95,000 people, with a reported mortality rate of about 0.2%. Every year millions of people are infected by influenza despite the existence of a yearly vaccine. According to the United States CDC weekly report, the number of childhood deaths in the United States so far from influenza during this flu season alone is 105. Compared with influenza, the number of patients who have died of coronavirus infection is less, but the virulence and mortality rate of coronavirus is significantly higher.</p><p id="p0495">Clinically, the patients with COVID-19 have no upper respiratory symptoms (such as runny nose, sneezing, sore throat). In 2003, a large number of medical personnel were infected, and iatrogenic transmission occurred in SARS. In contrast, although there are cases of nosocomial infection in SARS-CoV-2, most of them are out-of-hospital infections.</p></sec><sec id="sec14.2"><label>14.2</label><title>What can we learn from the 2020 nCoV epidemic in China?</title><p id="p0500">The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic of 2020 in China is an international crisis, affecting human lives, the global economy, societal views and lifestyle. During times of crisis, misinformation, blame and conspiracy theories abound. It is probably prudent to not entirely trust the media, whether local, regional or international, as each most likely has their own agenda. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of doctors and scientists to evaluate the events to ascertain whether or not more effective management of the crisis could have been attained. This comes with its own set of challenges, as hindsight is always 20/20.</p><p id="p0505">The quarantining of an entire country has been extreme, astounding and unprecedented. This not only involves quarantining measures within China but also internationally, as countries canceled flights into China, quarantined their own nationals as they returned from China and installed thermal scanners to detect ill people. But the quarantine measures inside China are certainly eye-opening. The entire city of Wuhan was shut off, and this was extended to every other city in China. In effect, the entire country was told to stay home, creating an enormous impact on the economy and on people's daily lives. Roads and stores became deserted (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>
). In Ningbo, each household was only permitted to send one person out for groceries every other day. Schools were closed till the end of March. Everyone wears masks. The objective was to starve the virus, to eliminate hosts. Yet even with these measures, new cases continued to appear. The quarantine measures in China have obviously come under a great deal of scrutiny, with so called &#x0201c;experts&#x0201d; weighing in, some saying that it will not work, that isolating a city deprives it of medical resources. Whatever the criticism, it is humbling to think of what may have happened without these draconian measures. It is also difficult to comprehend if such measures could actually take place in other parts of the world, or if the implementation of these changes could have taken place as quickly. For example, hand shaking is not part of Chinese culture, but it is almost automatic in other parts of the world, and it is normally done without even thinking. This is the first thing that would have to stop to help contain the virus.<fig id="fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Life in China in Beijing and Hubei during quarantine measures. Quarantine measures have led to empty streets and shopping centers.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0055">Fig. 10</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr10_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0510">Then there is the matter of the ophthalmologist and others who voiced concerns in the media about a cluster of cases of a flu-like illness near the end of December. At the present time, it is difficult to say whether or not the response could have been faster than it actually was, as this corresponds to the time when work began on viral sequencing. It is possible that medical teams were already working on the sequence at that time. It is also quite possible that officials did not initially sound the alarm publicly because they did not want to cause a panic. Perhaps this was the wrong decision, but these decisions are difficult in times of crisis and it is of course easy to second guess. It is easy to understand that this can be perceived as withholding information and why the public would be frustrated. The lesson here is that dissemination of accurate and validated information and establishing guidelines to prevent the spread of infections is critical.</p><p id="p0515">There are many &#x0201c;heroes&#x0201d; in these crises, people who have risked their lives and made incredible sacrifices to help society rid itself of this scourge, including those who work on the front lines, epidemiologists, scientists, doctors, first responders, and members of the public. Unfortunately, these events also bring out the worst in people. Numerous accounts of racial discrimination have been perpetrated against Asians across the world, many rising to the level of hate crimes. One must not forget the psychological impact of an infection such as this on people who are not even infected or who will never encounter an infected person.</p><p id="p0520">The emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2, suggests that coronavirus will pose a lasting threat to human beings. The epidemic will eventually be contained, and people's memory of the coronavirus may gradually blur. But we must not forget the lessons learned from this crisis, and already begin to take measures to prevent the next new outbreak of Coronavirus or some other virus from appearing in the future. If it does appear, how will we respond to it? What if it does not happen in China? Will other countries have the fortitude to implement even more drastic measures and mobilize resources to prevent the spread of the virus and to care for the sick?</p><p id="p0525">We can always improve on the handling of global pandemics or epidemics. From the lessons learned during the SARS and now the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, we can nearly provide a roadmap for the response to future outbreaks. The development of a vaccine for coronavirus is a critical step in prevention, but it may not be effective for future strains, and we must be ready for the next epidemic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec15"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0530">
