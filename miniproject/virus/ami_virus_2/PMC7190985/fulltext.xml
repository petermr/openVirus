Antiviral drugs that are effective as postexposure treatments against variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) or other OPXVs are critical in the event of an OPXV outbreak or exposure. The only US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug to treat smallpox, Tecovirimat (ST-246), exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting extracellular virus (EV) formation, thereby preventing cell&#x02013;cell and long-distance spread. We and others have previously demonstrated that host Golgi-associated retrograde proteins play an important role in monkeypox virus (MPXV) and vaccinia virus (VACV) EV formation. Inhibition of the retrograde pathway by small molecules such as Retro-2 has been shown to decrease VACV infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and to a lesser extent <italic>in vivo</italic>. To identify more potent inhibitors of the retrograde pathway, we screened a large panel of compounds containing a benzodiazepine scaffold like that of Retro-1, against VACV infection. We found that a subset of these compounds displayed better anti-VACV activity, causing a reduction in EV particle formation and viral spread compared to Retro-1. PA104 emerged as the most potent analog, inhibiting 90% viral spread at 1.3 &#x003bc;M with a high selectivity index. In addition, PA104 strongly inhibited two distinct ST-246-resistant viruses, demonstrating its potential benefit for use in combination therapy with ST-246. These data and further characterizations of the specific protein targets and <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of PA104 may have important implications for the design of effective antivirals against OPXV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>viral inhibitor</kwd><kwd>poxvirus</kwd><kwd>antiviral agent</kwd><kwd>retrograde transport</kwd><kwd>vaccinia virus</kwd><kwd>Retro-1</kwd><kwd>retrograde inhibitor</kwd><kwd>ST-246</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="4"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic> (OPXV) genus contains several human pathogens of public health concern, including variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox), monkeypox virus (MPXV), cowpox virus, and vaccinia virus (VACV, the virus that formulates the smallpox vaccine) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Fenner and Nakano, 1988</xref>). While smallpox has been eradicated, other OPXVs continue to pose a threat to human health due to the lack of protective immunity post the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Durski et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, the incidence of MPXV has been on the rise due to several recent outbreaks in West and Central Africa after a long hiatus in reported epidemics (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Durski et al., 2018</xref>). There is also a risk of MPXV infections spreading outside the endemic region through travel or the importation of infected animals, as seen in several recent cases (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Vaughan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Angelo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Erez et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the identification of several new OPXVs over the past decade demonstrates the ongoing circulation and maintenance of these viruses in animal reservoirs, and highlights the need for surveillance and development of better diagnostic assays and therapeutics (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Vora et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Springer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lanave et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>OPXVs are large double-stranded DNA viruses that have a complex life cycle, replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and generate two distinct virion forms: mature virus (MV) and extracellular virus (EV), differentiated based on the number of membranes surrounding the central DNA core (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Condit et al., 2006</xref>). Mature viruses consist of a viral core and a single viral membrane and harbor all the necessary proteins required for virus binding and entry. Although infectious, MVs remain inside an infected cell until lysis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). A proportion of MVs undergo double-membrane wrapping to generate wrapped virus (WV), which can stay attached to the infected cell (cell-associated virus) or exit the cell (EV) (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Moss, 2006</xref>). Although EV particles constitute only 1&#x02013;10% of MVs, they are essential for cell-to-cell and long-distance viral spread and therefore play an important role in OPXV pathogenesis (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Payne, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Blasco and Moss, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Engelstad and Smith, 1993</xref>). VACV mutants that fail to generate EVs produce small plaques <italic>in vitro</italic> and are attenuated <italic>in vivo</italic>, even in severely immunodeficient animal models (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Blasco and Moss, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Engelstad and Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Wolffe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Grosenbach et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The importance of EV formation for VACV pathogenesis is further highlighted by the fact that pharmacological intervention is efficacious in suppressing infection. At present, tecovirimat (ST-246) is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved antiviral available for postexposure treatment against smallpox. ST-246 targets the viral envelope protein F13 required for EV formation, thereby decreasing viral spread and infection-induced pathology (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Grosenbach et al., 2011</xref>). However, prolonged treatment of ST-246 can lead to the generation of drug-resistant viruses due to mutations in the F13L gene, as documented in a progressive vaccinia (PV) patient in 2009 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lederman et al., 2012</xref>). A single amino acid mutation in F13L may overcome the therapeutic effect of the drug, reinforcing the need for additional therapeutic candidates that are safe and effective against OPXVs.</p><p>In our efforts to develop new therapeutic strategies, we focused on the peculiar dependence of OPXVs on the retrograde transport pathway for EV formation. While several viruses (Simian virus 40, papillomavirus, and influenza) rely on retrograde transport for entry into a cell, OPXVs require retrograde transport for EV membrane wrapping, and consequently viral egress (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Spooner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sivan et al., 2016</xref>). We and others have previously demonstrated that impeding the retrograde pathway by targeting the Golgi-associated retrograde protein complex can greatly reduce EV yield with minimal impact on MV formation in VACV and MPXV (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Realegeno et al., 2017</xref>). Treatment with small molecule inhibitors of the retrograde pathway such as Retro-1 and Retro-2 significantly decreased EV formation <italic>in vitro</italic> by preventing the trafficking of the viral protein F13, which is required for membrane wrapping (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sivan et al., 2016</xref>). However, initial characterizations of the antiviral efficacy of Retro-2 <italic>in vivo</italic> yielded underwhelming results, with treated mice showing marginal improvement in signs of clinical disease and comparable lung viral titers compared to untreated mice (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, better clinical scores were only observed in animals pretreated with Retro-2, and not in mice treated only postinfection (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Given the highly selective, potent anti-VACV activities of Retro-1 and Retro-2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we were interested in structurally optimizing these small molecule inhibitors to identify novel antivirals with greater inhibitory effect compared to the parent compounds <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as better <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>To this end, we screened a diverse collection of greater than 80 compounds sharing a benzodiazepine scaffold like Retro-1 for efficacy in <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-VACV assays. These efforts led to the identification of a potent antiviral we have named PA104. Like Retro-1 and Retro-2, PA104 can potently inhibit EV formation and VACV spread, while minimally impacting MV yield and causing little to no cytotoxicity. We also show that the reduction in viral spread by PA104 is attributable to inhibition of EV formation as evidenced by lack of virus secreted in media and impaired actin tail formation in infected cells. It is particularly noteworthy that PA104 also inhibits viral spread of two distinct ST-246-resistant viruses, establishing its potential for use in postexposure treatment in combination with ST-246. These observations warrant further investigation of PA104 and its efficacy as an antiviral agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Viruses, Cell Lines, and Inhibitors</title><p>Vaccinia virus WR-GFP, VACV WR A4-YFP, VACV WR-Luc, and VACV IHDJ stocks were grown in BSC40 cells with Dulbecco modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

A serial dilution series of retrograde inhibitor compounds was mixed 1:1 (vol/vol) with VACV-WR-GFP virus diluted in DMEM-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.3. The mixture was transferred to black 96-well, clear-bottom plates (06-443-2; Corning, NY, United States) containing HeLa cells.

The cells were infected with the virus + compound mixture at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h. Following infection, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were then washed with PBS and stained with 4&#x02019;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclei visualization for 10 min at RT. The plates were imaged using the ArrayScan XTI High Content Screen (HCS) reader, and the percentage of GFP and DAPI positive cells was quantified using the HCS Studio Cell Analysis software as previously described (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>).

We sequenced the F13L gene of our isolated RV1 and found the previously reported resistance mutation A290V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The second virus, hereby referred to as RV2, was acquired from SIGA Technologies and contains the N267D resistance mutation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Retro-1 analogs PA104, PA24, and PA63 inhibit viral spread of ST-246-resistant VACV. <bold>(A)</bold> RV1 and RV2 sequence alignments showing preserved A290V and N267D mutations, respectively.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, all three compounds substantially reduced the size of RV2 plaques. For RV1, on the other hand, PA104 was markedly more effective in reducing viral spread than PA24 and PA63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Overall, these data show that retrograde inhibitors can block EV formation and spread of ST-246-resistant VACV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we describe the screening and characterization of a panel of compounds sharing the benzodiazepine scaffold of Retro-1. These efforts resulted in the discovery of three compounds, PA24, PA63, and PA104, with impressive antiviral activity against VACV, the most potent and promising of which is PA104. The structural differences between these analogs and their parent Retro-1 have been highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) data are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Data Sheets S1, S2</xref>. We demonstrated the following: (i) Retro-1 derivatives potently inhibit VACV spread <italic>in vitro</italic> with minimal cytotoxicity. (ii) The inhibitory effect was predominantly at a late stage of viral replication. (iii) EV formation is the main target of the analogs, which have little impact on MV yield. (iv) Retro-1 analogs can effectively decrease viral spread of ST-246-resistant viruses. In addition, we identified the Retro-1 derivative PA104 as a promising antiviral candidate with superior anti-VACV efficacy compared to the previously characterized Retro-1 and Retro-2, low cellular toxicity, and potent activity against ST-246-resistant viruses.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6</label><caption><p>Structural modifications in PA104, PA24, and PA63. All modifications made to the original Retro-1 structure shown in red.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fmicb-11-00603-g006"/></fig><p>In total, 83 compounds were tested for their ability to decrease VACV spread <italic>in vitro</italic>. We observed that 17 of these compounds had comparable or more potent anti-VACV activity than Retro-1 and Retro-2 (IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>90</sub> values &#x02264; Retro-1 and Retro-2). We focused on three compounds with high potency and low cytotoxicity, PA24, PA63, and PA104, and subsequently tested their impact on VACV entry and EV/MV yield. The most potent inhibitor of VACV spread, PA104, caused an observable reduction in luciferase activity even at 2.5 &#x003bc;M. In contrast, PA24 and PA63 only appeared to affect entry at higher concentrations. All three compounds tested minimally impacted MV yield while considerably reducing EV yield, except for PA104, which caused a small reduction in MV yield in addition to decreasing EV formation. The spread assay, entry assay, and MV/EV yield data together suggest that while the main mechanism of viral inhibition by Retro-1 derivatives is the inhibition of EV particle formation, select compounds such as PA104 may impact viral entry when present at concentrations greater than their effective inhibitory concentrations. These findings aligned well with previous characterizations of Retro-1 and Retro-2 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sivan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Vaccinia virus replicates in the cytoplasm of the infected cells, resulting in the formation of infectious, single-membrane MV particles at the site of replication (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Condit et al., 2006</xref>). Although infectious, these MV particles remain intracellular unless wrapped by two additional membranes of post-Golgi or endosomal origin to form EVs. Once the outer layer of the EV double membrane fuses with the plasma membrane, an EV can be propelled out of the infected cell by actin tails (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Because viral spread and EV yield were greatly reduced in the presence of our panel of compounds, we visualized actin tail-associated EVs in infected cells using confocal microscopy. Fewer actin tails were detected in the presence of all three compounds tested, PA104, PA63, and PA24, with the greatest reduction observed in case of PA104.</p><p>We and others have previously reported the spontaneous development of ST-246 resistance, both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Duraffour et al., 2015</xref>) and clinically in a smallpox-vaccinated PV patient receiving ST-246 as part of their treatment regimen (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lederman et al., 2012</xref>). In healthy individuals, it is possible that the immune response might overcome such resistant viruses, if they arise. However, additional interventions may be required for at-risk groups that cannot mount a protective immune response, such as individuals with immune deficiencies. For such cases, it would be beneficial to have additional antiviral candidates that can be administered in combination with ST-246 and can suppress ST-246-resistant viruses. We tested the inhibitory potential of PA104, PA63, and PA24 against two different ST-246-resistant viruses and found that all three compounds reduced viral spread of both viruses, as determined by a reduction in viral plaque size. Interestingly, while RV2 was substantially inhibited by all three Retro-1 compounds, RV1 appeared to be less efficiently inhibited by PA24 and PA63. These differences in the levels of viral inhibition by the same compounds could potentially be caused by additional uncharacterized mutations in other genes, or strain differences between the viruses; whereas RV1 was an Acambis strain of VACV, RV2 was a Western Reserve strain. Nevertheless, PA104 treatment resulted in maximal inhibition of plaque size for wild-type as well as RV1 and RV2 ST-246-resistant viruses. We hypothesize that its superior capacity to inhibit these viruses compared to PA24 and PA63 could be due to its ability to target multiple steps of VACV infection, including viral entry and MV formation, in addition to EV formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3"> 3</xref>).</p><p>In all, given its high SI (&#x0003e;800), submicromolar effective concentration, and potent inhibition of ST-246-resistant viruses, PA104 emerges as a promising candidate for future <italic>in vivo</italic> exploration. Further, PA104 targets a host-specific process rather than a viral protein, offering two additional advantages. First, the absence of a direct viral target reduces the probability of viral resistance to the compound (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lin and Gallay, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). Second is the possibility of broad-range applicability to other viruses and non-viral pathogens that utilize the retrograde pathway for entry or egress. We and others have previously shown that Retro-2 and its analogs can reduce <italic>Leishmania</italic>, polyomavirus, and papillomavirus infections, as well as inhibit Shiga toxin trafficking in cells (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Noel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Carney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Craig et al., 2017</xref>). Recent reports have also investigated the effect of Retro-2 derivatives on HSV2 infections (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2018</xref>). A majority of these studies have focused primarily on Retro-2 derivatives, and at present, less is understood about the antipathogenic potential of Retro-1 and its derivatives. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an in-depth, large-scale characterization of the inhibitory potential of compounds structurally related to Retro-1. As the retrograde pathway plays an important role for several pathogens and toxins, further characterization of compounds such as PA104 and exploration of their <italic>in vivo</italic> activity could have important implications for the design of broad-spectrum therapeutics that have immense public health benefits. An in-depth structure&#x02013;activity relationship study of PA104 and other structural analogs of Retro-1 is in progress and will be reported in due course.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>LP, JS, and PS contributed to the conception and design of the study.
