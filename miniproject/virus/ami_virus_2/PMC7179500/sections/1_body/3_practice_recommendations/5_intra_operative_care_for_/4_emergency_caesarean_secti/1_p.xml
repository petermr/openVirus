<p id="p0210">Neuraxial anaesthesia (epidural extension of labour analgesia, spinal or CSE anaesthesia) is preferred for emergency caesarean section to avoid the risks of aerosolisation associated with tracheal intubation and extubation. The most controversial topic is the choice of PPE. Conversion to general anaesthesia is a risk during all caesarean sections with planned neuraxial anaesthesia and increases with the urgency of delivery.

 </xref> Donning PPE for AGPs should be considered for emergency cases because of the elevated risk of failed or inadequate neuraxial block and the consequent need for mid-procedural conversion to general anaesthesia.

 </xref> Although it is theoretically possible to change masks from a standard surgical mask to a FFP3 (or similar) in the event of conversion to general anaesthesia, this could cause delay and also risk contamination of the individual clinician. Strategies to avoid the need for intra-operative conversion to general anaesthesia must be considered, including de novo initiation of spinal anaesthesia rather than extending poorly functioning labour epidural analgesia, or the use of CSE anaesthesia. If it has been decided that PPE for AGPs is indicated, the entire theatre team should be present in theatre, in appropriate PPE, donned before the patient is transferred to theatre. Maintaining the “last in, first out” principle (for the patient) may minimise the risk of exposure for the theatre team as they will remain in PPE at all times in the presence of the patient. It is essential to recognise that donning of PPE takes time and will inevitably impact on the decision-to-delivery time.

 </xref> The potential consequences of such delays should be explained to all women presenting in labour,

  <sup>13</sup>
 </xref> and ideally, local units should produce information sheets to be given to patients containing this information. Theatre teams should organise skills and drills training to practise donning of PPE in Category 1 emergency scenarios and thus to minimise delays. Guidance for the use of PPE in different caesarean section scenarios is shown in

In a case series of 17 COVID-19 parturients, refractory hypotension was observed to be more common in patients having an epidural top-up or CSE for the caesarean section when compared with those receiving general anaesthesia. However, no comparison was made to patients without COVID-19.

 </xref> The use of a prophylactic intravenous infusion of a vasopressor is recommended to prevent hypotension associated with neuraxial anaesthesia during caesarean section outside of COVID-19 infection;
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>40</sup>
 </xref> the anaesthetist should be aware of the possibility of excessive hypotension in a patient with COVID-19 and an increased requirement for treatment with vasopressors. Uterotonics can be associated with cardiovascular disturbance and should be administered by slow bolus or infusion.
