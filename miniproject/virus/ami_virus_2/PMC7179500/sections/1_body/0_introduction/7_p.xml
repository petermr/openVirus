 </xref> This article summarises current knowledge about COVID-19 disease in pregnancy with particular reference to obstetric anaesthesia care. As new evidence appears on an almost daily basis, official guidance will continue to evolve. In this article, we present a series of practical recommendations for the anaesthetic management of pregnant women, based on currently available evidence and practical experience. Case series data remain sparse in the obstetric population, so the recommendations presented here may also change rapidly.
