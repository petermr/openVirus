<p>It has been particularly important for antibody detection in the diagnosis of cases of novel and emerging HCoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [

In these situations, affected patients may not test positive for viral RNA, particularly in the early phase of the disease, but retrospectively can be shown to have developed an immune response. When SARS-CoV-2 was identified, especially when rapid antigen testing and/or molecular assays are neither available nor stable, serology can be used as a supplementary diagnostic tool. A recent study demonstrated that both IgM and IgG antibodies were detected 5 days after onset in all 39 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors recommended to use serology to facilitate the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections when an NP swab specimen was collected inappropriately and the molecular assays were performed unsatisfactorily [
