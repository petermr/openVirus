<p>Viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal swab/wash is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss early infection; a deeper specimen may need to be obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. Self-collected saliva specimens were tested positive in 11 of 12 COVID-19 patients, suggesting it is a promising non-invasive specimen for diagnosis, monitoring, and infection control in SARS-CoV-2 infections [
