<p>If the patient’s travel or exposure history or symptoms suggest possible infection with a high-risk, novel agent, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV, then the initial handling of the specimen should be performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions until the specimen or an aliquot is rendered noninfectious by lysis or another method. Virus isolation should not be routinely performed in this situation (

Accessed 4 February 2020). The U.S. CDC biosafety guidelines state that routine diagnostic testing of specimens from suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients, can be handled in a BSL-2 laboratory using standard precautions (
