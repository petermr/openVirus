<p>The risk of dengue infection and outbreak in Nepal is increasing year by year at different spatial scales [

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Limitations of diagnostic tools and poor health care systems continue to be the major challenges in the early detection and diagnosis of dengue [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is likely that the official tally of disease incidence is under-reported due to the complex nature of the disease and inadequate monitoring across the country. The majority of dengue patients are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms, and people are rarely tested due to high medical expenses and limited access to medical facilities in many regions of Nepal. Recent dengue epidemic outbreaks also exhibit unusual behaviour compared to the previous epidemics with an increased number of cases observed in the highlands of the Himalayan region in the temperate to subalpine climate [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This change is alarming and suggests that its range is likely expanding from tropical to temperate regions, which could be associated with climate change.
