 <p>Until recently, conventional culture techniques and immunofluorecence assays were considered the gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses, even though results are mostly available too late or lacked specificity and sensitivity. These methods are now widely replaced with appropriate DNA- and RNA-based amplification techniques, in particular real time PCR amplification, for the detection of an extended number of agents responsible for acute respiratory infections. Real-time PCR offers rapid results, efficiencies in work flow and a reduced risk of false positive results due to contamination. As a result, better patient management or reduction of unnecessary antibiotic administration will be possible leading to enhanced efficiencies in health care. In applying molecular methods to diagnostic use, the laboratory can optimise its diagnostic strategy by applying a combination of real-time amplification tests for respiratory viruses and the non-viral respiratory bacterial pathogens. However this must be done within a context of resource availability, technical expertise available and clinical utility. It seems certain that molecular microbiology will continue to develop, leading to further applications in diagnostic technology, thereby improving our understanding of disease processes and enhancing our knowledge of the pathogens responsible.</p>
