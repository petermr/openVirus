 <p>Acute lower respiratory infection is a common cause of morbidity in infants and children, and at times, requires intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Viral bronchiolitis and bacterial pneumonia account for the majority of lower respiratory tract infections that lead to respiratory insufficiency and pediatric intensive care admission. Twenty-seven percent of children who require mechanical ventilation for at least 24 h in pediatric intensive care units are diagnosed with bronchiolitis and 16% have the diagnosis of pneumonia. The median length of time intubated for an acute pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure is approximately 7 days.</p>
