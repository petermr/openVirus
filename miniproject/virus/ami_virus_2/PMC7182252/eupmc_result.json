    "Abstract:Respiratory viruses are commonly detected in both healthy and immunocompromised children. In most healthy children, respiratory viruses are associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract infections and are not accompanied by significant morbidity. In immunocompromised hosts, including hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and oncology patients, respiratory viruses can be associated with significant clinical manifestations, including prolonged viral shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death. This chapter reviews the major respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Other viruses can manifest as pulmonary infection; however, these viruses are discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 17 for discussion of cytomegalovirus and Chapter 22 for discussion of adenoviruses)."
