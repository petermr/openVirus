 </xref> Because India is the world capital of DM, HTN, and CVD, and is getting to terms with bracing the imminent impact of COVID-19, it becomes essential for us to know how to mitigate the risk of this lethal disease among the most vulnerable of our population. However, for that, it is crucial for us to know and understand the various ways and mechanisms of cardiac injuries caused by this novel coronavirus infection.
