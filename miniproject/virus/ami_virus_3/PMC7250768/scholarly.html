Abstract</div> <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a devastating global pandemic and continues to overwhelm the health-care facilities and shatter the economies of countries worldwide. Although it primarily affects the lungs, it shares a strong interplay with the cardiovascular system. The presence of underlying cardiovascular diseaseÂ and its risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) predispose the patients to increased severity and mortality associated with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 itself leads to various cardiovascular complications, which increase its associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients. It is, therefore, prudent to review the rapidly evolving data in this field and understand the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular involvement of this lethal disease.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="p0010">The whole world is facing an unprecedented challenge of stopping a virus called â€œsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)â€� that has caused havoc affecting more than 180 countries worldwide and caused numerous deaths across the globe.<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> World Health Organization has named the new and lethal disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as â€œCOVID-19â€� (Coronavirus Disease 2019).<a href="#bib2"><sup>2</sup></a> Over a short span of fewer than five months, COVID-19 has affected nearly 2.8 million people worldwide and caused more than 1,95,000 deaths globally (as on 25th April 2020). India recorded its first case on 30th January 2020 and 500th case on 25th March, but since then, there has been an upsurge of cases, and as on 25th April, India has recorded more than 25,000 cases and more than 785 deaths as a result of this deadly viral disease.</p> <p id="p0015">COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease; however, observational studies have shown a strong interplay between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease (CVD).<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> COVID-19 tends to be more severe in patients with established CVD or those with risk factors of CVD such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN).<a href="#bib3">3</a>, <a href="#bib4">4</a>, <a href="#bib5">5</a> Furthermore, it has been seen that COVID-19 provokes myocardial injury and dysfunction by various mechanisms (<a href="#fig1">Fig.Â 1</a> ), significantly increasing the morbidity and mortality.<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> Because India is the world capital of DM, HTN,Â and CVD, and is getting to terms with bracing the imminent impact of COVID-19, it becomes essential for us to know how to mitigate the risk of this lethal disease among the most vulnerable of our population. However, for that, it is crucial for us to know and understand the various ways and mechanisms of cardiac injuries caused by this novel coronavirus infection. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 1</span></a></div>   <p>Mechanisms behind cardiovascular injury associated with COVID-19.

Coronaviruses and mechanism of cardiac injury</div> <p id="p0020">SARS-CoV-2 is a novel single-stranded enveloped RNA virus, probably originating in chrysanthemum bats, with Malayan pangolins (who share 91% nucleotide identity) as intermediate hosts.<a href="#bib6"><sup>6</sup></a> There are seven known human coronaviruses. Four of these seven coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1) are benign and cause only self-resolving infections and account for 15â€"30% of common colds. However, the remaining three have been associated with epidemics of the SARSÂ in 2002 by SARS-CoV, in 2012 by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS)-CoV, and now COVID-19, a global pandemic in 2019â€"2020 by SARS-CoV-2.<a href="#bib6"><sup>6</sup></a> Of all three, COVID-19 appears to have the highest secondary infection rate (<a href="#fig2">Fig.Â 2</a> ). However, mortality seems to be lowest with COVID-19 (2%) compared with SARS (9.6%) and MERS (34.4%).<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> All three have been associated with cardiac complications, mainly in the form of myocarditis, heart failure, and arrhythmias.<a href="#bib6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 2</span></a></div>   <p>Epidemiological comparison of respiratory viral infections.</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="p0025">SARS-coronaviruses contain glycosylated spike proteins that bind to the cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors, after activation by transmembrane protease serine 2.<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> Alveolar epithelial cells appear to be the primary portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2, explaining its predominantly respiratory symptoms. ACE-2 is expressed mainly by the epithelial cells of the lungs, heart, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> ACE-2 is physiologically distinct from the ACE-1 enzyme. ACE-1 converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which then binds to the type 1 angiotensin II receptors. On the other hand, the principal function of ACE-2 is the degradation of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) into angiotensin 1â€"7 (Ang 1â€"7), which counteracts the actions of Ang-II.<a href="#bib7"><sup>7</sup></a></p> <p id="p0030">Because SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE-2 receptor, it, therefore, attenuates the residual ACE-2 activity, thus leading to a state of inappropriately increased Ang-II activity.<a href="#bib8"><sup>8</sup></a> Importantly, Ang-II has a lot of adverse effects. Besides inducing local, as well as systemic HTN and vasoconstriction, Ang-II is proatherosclerotic and causes inflammatory and oxidative organ damage. Locally increased Ang-II also triggers an increase in vascular permeability resulting in pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)â€"like picture.<a href="#bib7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib8"><sup>8</sup></a> Thus, by an effect on ACE-2 receptors, SARS-CoV-2 predisposes to acute lung injury, myocardial damage, inflammatory organ damage, and a prothrombotic state, responsible for its varied systemic complications and multiorgan dysfunction. Direct invasion of myocyte by the virus might also result in myocyte necrosis and, eventually, myocardial damage.<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> (<a href="#fig1">Fig.Â 1</a>).</p> <p id="p0035">Secondly, COVID-19 leads to an inflammatory state, which results in a cytokine storm triggered by an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response by type 1 and type 2Â T helper cells.<a href="#bib7"><sup>7</sup></a> This results in continuous activation and proliferation of various cytokines, which cause apoptosis and necrosis of myocardial cells and also predispose to plaque rupture. Finally, hypoxia-induced excessive intracellular calcium deposition resulting in myocardial cell apoptosis can also lead to myocardial damage associated with COVID-19. There is a state of oxygen supply-demand mismatch caused as a result of infection-induced increased myocardial oxygen demand.<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a></p> </div> <div class="covid-19inpatientswithunderlyingcvd" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
COVID-19 in patients with underlying CVD</div> <p id="p0040">Being cardiologists, it is of great concern to us whether COVID-19 is more common in patients with pre-existing CVD. Evidence from the previous epidemics suggests that SARS (2002) and MERS (2012) were commonly associated with prior cardiac and cerebrovascular abnormalities.<a href="#bib9">9</a>, <a href="#bib10">10</a>, <a href="#bib11">11</a> In SARS, DM and CVD were seen in 11%, and 8% of patients, respectively, and the presence of either of them doubled the mortality.<a href="#bib9"><sup>9</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib10"><sup>10</sup></a> Similarly, in a systematic analysis involving 637 patients with MERS, the prevalence of DM, HTN, CVD, and obesity was 50%, 50%, 30%, and 16%, respectively.<a href="#bib11"><sup>11</sup></a></p> <p id="p0045">Similar trends of an increased presence of cardiovascular comorbidities have been observed in patients with COVID-19. In one of the largest Chinese cohort of 1099 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (outpatient and inpatient), the prevalence of patients having pre-existing HTN, DM, coronary artery disease (CAD), and cerebrovascular disease was 15%, 7.4%, 2.5%, and 1.4%, respectively.<a href="#bib12"><sup>12</sup></a> Among patients who were intubated or died, the prevalence of these comorbidities increased to 36%, 27%, 9%, and 6%, respectively.<a href="#bib12"><sup>12</sup></a> In another study involving 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan, HTN (30.5%), DM (14.4%), and CAD (10.6%) were the three most common comorbidities, followed by cerebrovascular disease (5.3%) and chronic heart failure (4.1%).<a href="#bib13"><sup>13</sup></a> Similarly, in a systemic meta-analysis of 6 Chinese studies, involving 1527 patients, the proportions of HTN, cardiovascular disease and DM in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7%, respectively. These proportions increased to about two-folds, three-folds, and two-folds, respectively, higher in severe/intensive care unit (ICU) cases than in their non-severe/non-ICU counterparts.<a href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a> Interestingly, the CVDs report of the year 2018 from China reveals the prevalence of HTN and DM to be 23.2% and 10.9%, respectively, among the general population.<a href="#bib15"><sup>15</sup></a> Therefore, the prevalence of HTN and diabetes in people infected with the virus was not higher compared with the general population.</p> <p id="p0050">Similar trends of comorbidities were observed in an analysis of 355 patients who died of COVID-19 in Italy, with pre-existing HTN, DM, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and cerebrovascular disease recorded in 76%, 35.5%, 30%, 24.5%, and 9.6%, respectively.<a href="#bib16"><sup>16</sup></a> Finally, preliminary data from the United States involving 7162 patients with COVID-19 revealed the presence of DM in 10.9% and prior CVD in 9% of patients.<a href="#bib17"><sup>17</sup></a> It was also revealed that the presence of underlying health conditions such as DM, chronic lung disease, and CVD, were associated with a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19â€"associated disease than persons without these conditions.<a href="#bib17"><sup>17</sup></a></p> <p id="p0055">Thus, it is a matter of debate whether the presence of underlying CVD and its risk factors such as DM and HTN predispose a person to a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Still, one thing is clear that they are associated with increased severity and complications of COVID-19 (<a href="#fig3">Fig.Â 3</a> ). The mechanism of this association, however, remains unclear at this time. Possible explanations include the advanced age of patients with these comorbidities, functionally impaired immune system, higher levels of ACE-2 in patients with DM, and patients using anti-hypertensive medications like ACE-inhibitors and ARBs (Ang-II Receptor Blockers). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig.Â 3</span></a></div>   <p>Pictorial diagram showing cardiovascular comorbidities and sequelae of COVID-19.

COVID-19 may exacerbate underlying CVD and may also give rise to new cardiovascular injuries.<a href="#bib20"><sup>20</sup></a> Evidence is now available, supporting the fact that the risk of developing cardiovascular complications is more among patients who have pre-existing CVD compared with those who do not.<a href="#bib20"><sup>20</sup></a> In a retrospective analysis of 187 confirmed patients with COVID-19, those with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of troponin T levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs. 16 [13.2%]).<a href="#bib20"><sup>20</sup></a></p> <div class="myocardialinjury" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Myocardial injury</div> <p id="p0065">Myocardial injury, as defined by an increased troponin level, can occur due to myocardial ischemia/infarction or non-ischemic myocardial injury (myocarditis). In a study involving 416 hospitalized Chinese patients with COVID-19, approximately 20% of patients had cardiac injury defined as high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TNI) higher than the 99% percentile upper reference limit. Patients with elevated hs-TNI were elderly, had more comorbidities, and also had higher levels of leukocytes, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptides, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, compared with those without elevated hs-TNI.<a href="#bib13"><sup>13</sup></a> Another study by Guo etÂ al<a href="#bib20"><sup>20</sup></a> showed that 28% of the total of 187 hospitalized patients with COVID-19Â had evidence of acute myocardial injury in the form of elevated troponin T levels. A meta-analysis of 4 studies involving 341 patients, showed significantly higher cardiac troponin I levels in those with severe COVID-19 infection compared with those without (standardized mean difference: 25.6Â ng/L; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8â€"44.5Â ng/L).<a href="#bib22"><sup>22</sup></a></p> <p id="p0070">Initial reports from China indicated that there are two patterns of myocardial injury with COVID-19â€"Primary or secondary myocardial injury.

Besides initial triaging, it provides useful prognostic information and also helps to decide which patient requires more intensive care.</div></p> <p id="p0075">The other pattern of myocardial injury involves the primary myocardial damage, in which the patients present predominantly with cardiac complaints instead of respiratory symptoms. It can occur secondary to acute myocardial infarction (type 1) in a patient with COVID-19. However, it can also occur as a result of either viral myocarditis or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. The possibility of the latter two entities finds support from a few case reports where patients with COVID-19 have presented primarily with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, along with ST-T changes on electrocardiogram, but with normal coronary angiograms.<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib24">24</a>, <a href="#bib25">25</a>, <a href="#bib26">26</a> In a recently published case report, an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman developed acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging a week after onset of fever and dry cough owing to COVID-19.

Considerations for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular complications</div> <p id="p0110">India, as on 25th April 2020, is witnessing a sharp rise in the cases of COVID-19. In the coming days, we are likely to see an increase in the number of hospitalized patients and, as aforementioned, a high burden of cardiovascular complications. The hospital systems need to ensure preparedness for dealing with a large volume of such patients, many of whom would need ICU care and/or acute cardiac care. Unfortunately, no specific antiviral therapy or vaccines are available for COVID-19. Preventive measures, along with symptomatic supportive treatment, are the best strategies for COVID-19 and its complications at this time. It is crucial to triage the patients according to the status of underlying CVD as the patients with prior CVD, or its risk factors are more prone to develop cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hence, appropriate protocols for rapid diagnosis, triaging, isolation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19 with cardiovascular complications should be prepared and well-rehearsed by the hospital administration. As a cardiovascular physician, it is imperative to encourage the use of telemedicine/telehealth for triage and patient management, wherever it is feasible. In-person visits and consultations should be avoided. It is important to cancel elective procedures, i.e., echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization unless they likely to affect outcome meaningfully. Adherence to national/international guidelines for optimal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended.</p> <p id="p0115">American College of Cardiology, in a recent statement, has recommended not to measure troponin levels or natriuretic peptides in patients with COVID-19 unless the diagnosis of acute MI or heart failure is suspected on clinical grounds.<a href="#bib39"><sup>39</sup></a> However, there is evidence that there is a progressive serial increase in both troponin and NT-pro BNP levels during hospitalization in patients who follow a deteriorating clinical course towardÂ death. In contrast, the levels of these biomarkers remain stable and low in those with less severe disease and a more favorable clinical course towardÂ successful treatment and discharge.<a href="#bib20"><sup>20</sup></a> Therefore, frequent and periodic estimation of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, and NT-pro BNP is warranted in hospitalized patients who have prior CVD or its risk factors, and in those who show early evidence of cardiac injury. Worsening in any of these during serial recording should be regarded as a warning sign for poor outcome, and early and appropriate intervention should be initiated.</p> <p id="p0120">The use of ACE-I/ARB in patients with COVID-19 remains controversial. It is concerning because SARS-CoV-2 enters the human cells by binding to ACE-2 receptors, and the increased ACE-2 expression induced by therapy with ACE-I or ARB would aggravate the infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the available data does not show any difference in outcome among patients treated with or without ACE-I/ARB. On the other hand, a prior study showed a beneficial effect of ACE-I/ARB therapy in patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia.<a href="#bib40"><sup>40</sup></a> The mechanism responsible for this beneficial effect was a reduction in the viral infectionâ€"induced pulmonary inflammatory response and cytokine release. Some have attributed this beneficial effect to a compensatory increase in ACE-2.<a href="#bib41"><sup>41</sup></a> Until data from more extensive clinical studies becomes available, it is recommended to continue using ACE-I/ARBs in patients who are at risk for, are being evaluated for, or have COVID-19, a position supported by multiple society guidelines.<a href="#bib42"><sup>42</sup></a></p> <p id="p0125">The care of ACS in patients with COVID-19 is challenging. Ideally, all patients with ACS should be managed as per the standard guidelines, but new protocols have to be set for new challenges. Every institution or health-care facility needs to develop its own protocol for the management of patients with ACS during the COVID-19 crisis based on the clinical profile of patients, and the availability of workforce, adequate PPE, and a COVID-19 dedicated cardiac catheterization laboratory with preferably negative pressure ventilation.<a href="#bib37"><sup>37</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib38"><sup>38</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#bib43"><sup>43</sup></a></p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p id="p0130">COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe health threat on an international scale. Cardiovascular comorbidities are common in patients with severe COVID-19 and are associated with increased mortality. Elevation of cardiac enzymes, suggesting acute cardiac injury, can occur in up to one-fourth of patients with COVID-19 and worsens its outcome. It is crucial to measure cardiac biomarkers such as Troponins and NT-pro BNP serially in hospitalized patients to triage the patients, monitor treatment, and to predict prognosis. Our understanding of this novel coronavirus and its cardiovascular implications is still evolving. Researchers around the world need to share the data continuously at a rapid pace so that we can have a detailed understanding of this novel coronavirus and curb the menace it has caused.</p> </div> <div class="COI-statement" title="COI-statement"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
