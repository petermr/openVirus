 <p>In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as other viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide. As a convergence science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on the application of engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside. Given these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well suited to apply their skill set to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general. This work introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers, and highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the current pandemic, including 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> model systems, vaccine technology, and small-molecule drug delivery. COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists across all disciplines, and tissue engineers are well trained to be leaders and contributors in this time of need.

  <title>Impact statement</title>
  <p>Given the steep mortality caused by the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is clear need for advances in diagnostics and therapeutics for viral outbreaks. Tissue engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral outbreaks. Tissue engineers, if mobilized, could play key roles as leaders in the outbreak, given their ability to apply engineering principles to biological processes, experience in collaborative environments, and penchant for technological translation from benchtop to bedside. In this work, three areas pioneered by tissue engineers that could be applied to the current COVID-19 crisis and future viral outbreaks are highlighted.</p>
