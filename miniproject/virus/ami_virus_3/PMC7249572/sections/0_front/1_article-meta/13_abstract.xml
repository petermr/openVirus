 <p>There has been a collaborative global effort to construct novel therapeutic and prophylactic approaches to SARS-CoV-2 management. Although vaccine development is crucial, acute management of newly infected patients, especially those with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a priority. Herein we describe the rationale and potential of repurposing a dual plasmid, Vigil (pbi-shRNA
  <sup>furin</sup>-GM-CSF), now in Phase III cancer trials, for the treatment of and, in certain circumstances, enhancement of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
