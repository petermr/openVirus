<p id="p0070">The hypothesis that atmospheric pollution may influence the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy was also tested from the relationships between the confirmed cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated April 27, 2020) with the corresponding air quality data. The latter were expressed as average concentrations in the last 4 years of NO
 <sub>2</sub>, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and PM
 <sub>10</sub> (

 <sub>3</sub> and PM
 <sub>10</sub> (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D–E). The always significant correlations provided further evidence on the role that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may have as a favourable context for the spread and virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 within a population subjected to a higher incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections.
