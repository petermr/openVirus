Introduction</title><p>The last decades have seen the lack of new therapeutic drug developments against infectious diseases. Thus, emergence of several resistances and new epidemics are more and more noticed all over the world. These public health concerns have led to (re)evaluating traditional medical practices in order to highlight new molecules or new mechanisms of action. Plants like <italic>Morus</italic> spp., jackfruit (<italic>Artocarpus heterophyllus</italic>), <italic>coffea,</italic> and others are more and more studied in this context. Their potential activity against viral infections have been previously described in several studies [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Viral respiratory infections cause life-threatening diseases in millions of people worldwide every year. Human coronaviruses and several picornaviruses are responsible for regular worldwide epidemic outbreaks, thus representing a growing global public health problem. For instance, picornavirus infections are the most common infections identified in patients of all ages, and during peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Among these viruses, enteroviruses like poliovirus 1 (PV1), human echoviruses, and parechoviruses share common features&#x02014;they are small (20&#x02013;30 nm), nonenveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses, causing mild respiratory diseases; however, HPeV type 1 and 3 (HPeV1 and 3) and echovirus 11 (Echo 11) can cause severe systemic diseases in young infants [<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Structurally different, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are bigger (120&#x02013;160 nm), enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses responsible for a large portion of upper and mild respiratory tract infections, like the common cold, bronchitis, or pneumonia. They have been isolated worldwide. Most established coronaviruses exhibit winter seasonality, with global geographical distributions of the documented cases [<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They also can be severe and deadly for newborns, young infants, elderly, or immunosuppressed patients and can be associated with high rates of mortality. Indeed, no treatments, nor vaccines, are available against HCoVs, and the existing treatments are essentially symptomatic. Few new molecules show an interest in this context (i.e., glycyrrhizin and nelfivanir) [<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The lack of specific treatment and the emergence of several and recent pandemics due to coronaviruses like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, 2002&#x02013;2003) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2012), as the actual epidemic started in China (December, 2019), where a new HCoV is emerging (2019-nCov, then renamed SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), underline the strong need of further investigations in the physiopathology and treatments of such pathologies [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The development of research fields like ethnopharmacology highlight the interest in traditional medical practices. In this context, <italic>Morus</italic> species have been reported for their medicinal uses in many regions of the world. Its antibacterial and antifungal activities have been previously studied [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The genus <italic>Morus</italic>, which belongs to the family <italic>Moraceae</italic>, counts 24 species with at least 100 varieties. The origins of <italic>Morus spp</italic>. are believed to be in Asia, but the plant has spread all over the world, and it can now grow from temperate to subtropical regions. Its growth does not require specific soil properties [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>For centuries, Asian populations, especially Chinese populations, traditionally used <italic>Morus spp</italic>. against fever, sore throat, to protect the liver, enhance eyesight, rheumatism, diuresis, and blood pressure [<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consequently, the different parts of the plant have been studied for potential biological activities [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several chemical families have been isolated in <italic>Morus</italic> species, like flavonoids, benzofurans, stilbene, polyhydroxylated alkaloids, and kuwanons, showing a large variety of pharmacological activities. For example, flavonoids and oxyresveratrol showed anti-inflammatory activities, while mulberrofuran showed antibacterial activities against pathogens like <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The group of kuwanons (isoprenylated flavonoids) include various compounds like kuwanon C, E, G, H, J, and S, which exhibit distinct biological activities. Indeed, kuwanon G showed antibacterial activities against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> at 12 &#x000b5;g/mL (minimal inhibition concentration) [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Kuwanon C has shown an antifungal activity against <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Studies exploring the antiviral activities of <italic>Morus</italic> extracts are less numerous despite a confirmed potential. Indeed, mulberry juice reduces the cytopathogenic effect of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) and feline calicivirus FCV-F9 [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Arylbenzofurans extracted from <italic>Morus</italic> cortex are described like replication inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Scientific literature also describes kuwanons (among others chemical structures found in <italic>Morus</italic> spp.) as potentially antiviral. Indeed, the authors of [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported kuwanon H as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibitor, leachianone as a human simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV 1 and 2) inhibitor, and three flavonoids as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenoviruses inhibitors [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other kuwanons, like kuwanon G, a prenylated flavon, have been studied for several biological properties, like anti-inflammation activity, anti-oxidant, and antibacterial activities [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Though the bioactivity of kuwanon G is evident, no antiviral activity has yet been described for this compound.</p><p>In this context, <italic>Morus</italic> species show a good pharmacological potential against several pathologies, including emerging viruses. Considering the needs of new therapeutic strategies against pathogenic respiratory viruses like coronaviruses and picornaviruses, this study proposes to evaluate the potential activity of aqueous and hydromethanolic extracts from the stem barks and leaves of three different species of mulberry&#x02014;<italic>Morus alba</italic> var. <italic>alba</italic>, <italic>Morus alba</italic> var. <italic>rosa</italic>, and <italic>Morus rubra</italic> on human coronavirus 229E and four different members of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family&#x02014;human poliovirus 1, human parechovirus 1 and 3, and human echovirus 11. The study was further extended to the analysis of the phytochemistry profiles of the plants by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC&#x02013;MS) and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS) and the quantitative investigation by GC&#x02013;MS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-25-01876"><title>2.

Mass Spectrometry Characterisation of Morus spp. Extracts</title><p>In this study, we achieved the characterization of various compounds, like flavonoids and other phenolic components extracted from lyophilized mulberry leaves and stem barks, from water and hydroalcohol extracts. Identification of mulberry leaves and stem bark constituents was carried out on the basis of the complementary information obtained from high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI/QTOF). To the best of our knowledge, the list of the identified compounds is consistent with the one reported in the literature in the three cultivars analyzed. Our HRMS analysis revealed the presence of different polyphenolic compounds in the extracts, with coumarins, tannins, triterpenes, and flavonoids being the major ones. We further identified specific compounds found in the majority and in the most effective antiviral extracts, such as alkaloids (1-deoxynojirimycin), prenylated flavonoids (kuwanon G), and stilbenoids (mulberroside A).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-25-01876"><title>2.2.

Discussion</title><p>The ethnopharmacological approach has the potential to identify new antiviral compounds, yet relatively few antiviral screenings of plant ethnomedicines have been conducted.</p><p>The 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of studied extracts of the three <italic>Morus</italic> species were different between the aqueous and hydromethanolic extracts and between the leaves and stem barks&#x02019; extracts. The fact that methanolic extracts seem to be more toxic indicates that the organic fraction may contain more cytotoxic compounds. Further analyses of the extracts could provide more information about these compounds.</p><p>It also appears that extracts can exert antiviral effects in vivo, but this effect may not be detected by in vitro assays because of the extremely low concentrations of extracts tolerated by the cells in the artificial system [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is also possible that the total extract contains synergistic compounds that are necessary to ensure an antiviral activity.</p><p>Our results suggest that hydromethanolic extracts are more efficient in inhibiting the HCoV 229E infection in L-132 cells.</p><p>Indeed, aqueous and hydromethanolic stem barks and leaves&#x02019; extracts showed lower antiviral activity towards picornaviruses compared to HCoV 229E at the tested concentrations. Certainly, hydromethanolic leaves&#x02019; extracts showed the best antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, especially the <italic>M. alba</italic> var. <italic>alba</italic> extract, which completely eliminated the HCoV 229E infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01876-f002">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>M. alba</italic> var. <italic>rosea</italic> stem barks&#x02019; hydromethanolic extract was also the most active against HCoV 229E.</p><p>The better inhibitions against the enveloped virus (HCoV 229E) than the nonenveloped viruses (PV 1, HPeV 1, HPeV 3, and Echo 11) suggest that the active components might inhibit the interaction between the binding sites of the virus to the host cells by inhibiting a ligand of the viral envelope. The interaction between the virus envelope and the extracts could be related to the binding of phytochemical phenolic compounds with the protein coat of the virus and the viral attachment to the host cells.</p><p>In view of the significant proportion of plant extracts that have yielded positive results in these screenings, it seems reasonable to conclude that there are probably numerous types of antiviral compounds (like kuwanons, mulberrofuran, or oxyresveratrol) in these materials. Further characterization of the active ingredients of these plants might reveal more useful compounds [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>A number of medicinal plants have been reported to contain compounds possessing strong antiviral activity [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

In previous works, phenolic acids and flavonol glycosides were identified in mulberry leaves [<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-01876" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
