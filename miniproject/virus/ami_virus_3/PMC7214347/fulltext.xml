It is quite evident from Wuhan experience that the stricter the isolation rules for assessed or potentially infected people, the easier it is to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spreading. This was the case in Rome where, immediately after being diagnosed, the two Chinese infected persons were admitted into the Spallanzani Hospital, a 40-year-renowned research and care center for infectious diseases and all their travel-mates and contacts were identified and isolated into the Cecchignola military citadel on the outskirts of Rome. All over Lombardy, instead, due to the lack of symptoms of infected people for several days or even weeks, virus spread was much wider, thus reaching out to Veneto and Emilia-Romagna regions, and presumably required longer to develop earlier symptoms after being infected.</p><p id="p0045">This might be explained by the fact that the two Chinese cases in Rome were older than Case 1 in Codogno (i.e. 68 vs 38&#x000a0;years of age). The former followed an easily traceable tourist itinerary while the latter moved around quite easily and extensively among regions making it impossible to track down all contacts. Moreover, the evidence so far seems to indicate that, besides being burdened by higher mortality due to the frequent coexistence of other diseases, older subjects are more easily infected and severely ill and this might have caused weakness symptoms quite soon preventing the Chinese patients in Rome from moving around <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. There are also anecdotical reports concerning a shorter incubation period in the elderly which might add to the above, yet further studies are still needed to validate such hypothesis.</p><p id="p0050">Are there any other possible explanations for accelerated coronavirus spread in Lombardy? Indeed, the most affected area in the region, including Milan and its hinterland, is quite rich in farms and industries asking for intensive daily commuting and in the early phases of the epidemic most activities were still in place and partially stopped only about two weeks later. In fact, beginning of March, after the outbreak had already shown its threatening potential, only &#x0201c;crucial&#x0201d; activities were allowed to go on including food and drug chains, logistic support providers, general practitioner (GP) offices, which anyway involved some 40% of the working population <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. So considerable train, metro and bus commuting, relatively late recognition and multiple outbreak sites might have favored such a large infection spreading pattern in Northern Italy.</p><p id="p0055">Two more observations might also be taken into account, albeit requiring further validation by controlled studies: (i) a large number of treatment-resistant pneumonia events occurring already in January were reported by GPs <italic>a posteriori</italic>, i.e. after SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and might reflect the presence in the area of potentially unrecognized carriers responsible for the exponential spreading of coronavirus infection <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and (ii) more severe fine dust pollution and less favorable hygrometric and barometric environmental conditions characterize the whole Po Valley as compared to the rest of Italy, as also apparent from European Space Agency reports <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p id="p0060">Finally, as far as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is concerned, we now have to underline that, as recently pointed out by two Italian groups <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and reported by Chinese scientists directly involved in the management of COVID-19 infection <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the disease is extremely frequent and associates with a higher mortality rate in hospitalized patients (<xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>

On the other hand, according to a retrospective study from Wuhan some 10% COVID-19-positive patients with T2DM suffered at least one hypoglycemic event (&#x0003c;3.9&#x000a0;mmol/L) <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Notoriously, hypoglycemia mobilizes pro-inflammatory monocytes and increases platelet reactivity, thus contributing to a higher cardiovascular mortality in patients with DM <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p id="p0075">In addition, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance enhance the build-up of glycosylation end products (AGEs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines causing severe oxidative stress and increased inflammation-related adhesion molecule release <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.

<xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In animal models, structural lung changes have been related to diabetes, such as augmented vasculature permeability and collapsed alveolar epithelium <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Finally, abnormal delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and complement activation dysfunction <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> have been reported in patients with DM. All of the above suggests that the greatest possible attention should be paid to the high risk for more severe lung involvement pending on people with DM during COVID-19 infection, due to a significantly lower forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in the presence of raised glucose levels <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p id="p0085">So which pathogenetic elements underly higher susceptibility to COVID-19 disease and mortality rate in people with DM? The virus itself and its toxins precipitate a cytokine thunderstorm exacerbating hypercoagulation in patients with DM <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> who, by definition, face a clear-cut prothrombotic state <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, further aggravated by chronic low-grade inflammation causing atherosclerosis-related endothelial dysfunction and insulin-resistance associated arterial hypertension <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. All above-mentioned phenomena are known to become more and more severe as age increases and this is in line with the observation that octogenarian individuals are mostly affected by SARS-CoV-2 disease <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p id="p0090">With respect to that, an issue deserving special attention is the quite similar SASR-CoV-2 infection rate in people without or with DM <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> in front of a much greater severity of the disease as reported by the Italian ISS in the latter. At this point we also feel like underlining that some hypoglycemic treatment strategies might turn out to be protective. Dipeptidyl-dipeptidase-4 (DPP-4) was shown, in fact, to be the primary receptor of MERS-CoV <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>: the possibility that DPP-4 also acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 warrants investigation and, should this be the case, in agreement with the hypothesis put forward by Iacobellis <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, DPP-4 inhibitors, well-renowned treatment tools in T2DM, should be explored for their anti-viral potential in the human <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Opposite to that, it has been recently hypothesized that Sodium-Glucose-Transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), Pioglitazone and even Insulin might induce an over-expression of the ACE2 receptor which was also found to bind to coronaviruses in the alveoli <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and therefore increase the risk for a more severe expression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with diabetes <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p id="p0095">Corticosteroid utilization also requires special attention with respect to COVID-19 disease severity in people with DM <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are partly due to the host immune response and corticosteroids were broadly used in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> due to their ability to suppress histologically proven virus-dependent lung inflammation with diffuse alveolar damage <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, they also inhibit immunity and pathogen clearance and, in the face of very little benefit if so ever, have been associated with delayed viral RNA clearance or increased mortality and rate of complications, including diabetes, psychosis, and avascular necrosis <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Due to all the above, the interim guidance from the WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection advises against the use of corticosteroids upon suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside clinical trials <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, yet corticosteroids were extensively utilized before that in at least 34% of the large number of Northern Italian hospitalized patients <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. At analysing the growth curve of coronavirus infection in Italy, the massive referral to the hospitals of so many people within a very a short period strikes the eye when compared to the small number of hospitalized patients in the South (Figura 4). In the stormy and overcrowded emergency conditions faced by health professionals at the start of the epidemic in the absence of any experience with treating COVID-19 disease, a broader recourse to high doses of corticosteroids most likely occurred than later on, when in fact better treatment strategies were identified and emergency departments were less congested. It can be assumed that the above mentioned logistic and environmental factors strongly affected clinical course and mortality rates of COVID-19-infected people and even more in those with DM. Indeed, <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>
clearly shows that death rate was significantly higher in infected Northern Italy inhabitants than in their Southern counterpart (i.e. 17.2% vs 5.5%, respectively). According to current protocols, subject to the exceptions needed for treatment personalization, the use of corticosteroids is extremely limited if so ever. This might also help healthcare teams adopt an intensive, fully integrated therapeutic approach for their patients with DM, especially those in the ICUs, involving drugs expected to prevent at their best both hypoglycemic events and dramatic hyperglycemic spikes contributing to marked glycemic variability, i.e. a severe mortality risk driver <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> (see <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>

The latter, however, display a slightly higher phenolic acid and lignan intake due to a higher consumption of cereals and legumes and a slightly lower total polyphenol intake as flavonoids and stilbenes due to lower wine consumption <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. This takes on a particular significance when comparing the absolute and relative death rate of subjects with T2DM in Lombardy (11,384 deaths; 56.9% of infected individuals) to that observed in Lazio (259 deaths; 1.3% of infected individuals). Might this add to the picture?
