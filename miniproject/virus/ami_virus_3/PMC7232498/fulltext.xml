Two phylogenetically distinct IBV lineages, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, co-circulate worldwide and they present challenges for vaccine strain selection. Until the present study, there was little information regarding the pattern of the circulating strains of IBV in Uruguay. A subset of positive influenza B samples from influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatients and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) inpatients detected in sentinel hospitals in Uruguay during 2012&#x02013;2019 were selected. The sequencing of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes showed substitutions at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the co-circulation of both lineages in almost all seasonal epidemics in Uruguay, and allows recognizing a lineage-level vaccine mismatch in approximately one-third of the seasons studied. The epidemiological results show that the proportion of IBV found in ILI was significantly higher than the observed in SARI cases across different groups of age (9.7% ILI, 3.2% SARI) and patients between 5&#x02013;14 years constituted the majority (33%) of all influenza B infection (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Introduction</title><p>Influenza viruses are considered to be a major human health problem with a global distribution, with considerable impact on the quality of life and productivity of the society. An estimated of more than 290,000 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths annually occur worldwide [<xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the American region, each year, an average of 772,000 respiratory hospitalizations is attributed to influenza virus [<xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although influenza A viruses (IAV) are responsible for pandemics and they have major rates of hospitalization and mortality attribution, influenza B viruses (IBV) cause epidemics worldwide annually, becoming responsible in some years for more than 25% of human seasonal influenza infections, and its prevention represents an important public health priority [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In vaccine mismatch seasons, hospitalization due to IBV can exceed IAV in all age groups, particularly among children and young teenagers [<xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>IBV were first identified in the 1940s and, unlike influenza A, they primarily cause disease in humans [<xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recurrent seasonal epidemics are the consequence of the antigenic drift, ongoing changes in the amino-acid sequences at antigenic sites in the two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [<xref rid="B8-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. During the early 1980s, evolutionary changes in the HA gene diverged into two phylogenetically and antigenically distinct lineages that are represented by B/Victoria/2/87 (Victoria lineage) and B/Yamagata/16/88 (Yamagata lineage) [<xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Since 2001, both lineages have co-circulated, showing distinct antigenicity and transmission dynamics and often alternating in regional dominance presenting challenges for vaccine strain selection [<xref rid="B10-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Importantly, the co-circulation of the two lineages results in a different pattern of evolution of influenza B virus and can explain some of the disparate variability of seasonal outbreaks [<xref rid="B11-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent reports have highlighted the potential differences in the epidemiology of Victoria and Yamagata lineage viruses, including younger average ages of persons with Victoria virus infection and greater transmissibility. The Victoria lineage is under greater positive selection pressure and, hence, likely to experience greater antigenic drift than the more conserved Yamagata lineage [<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective method for preventing influenza and its associated complications. In general, seasonal vaccines are trivalent, including one influenza B lineage. Despite being only two lineages, the selection of the right influenza B virus strain in the vaccine has been proven very difficult, because the dominant lineage changes over time, as result, the vaccine efficacy decreased when the included vaccine strain did not match the circulating epidemic strain [<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to describe the circulating patterns of IBV strains in Uruguay between 2012&#x02013;2019 as well as determine the age groups that are associated with both influenza B lineages and surveillance type. In addition, we evaluated the concordance between the predominant circulating influenza B lineage and the B lineage included in the vaccine applied in each season. Additionally, we intended to determine the phylogenetic relationships between the circulating strains in Uruguay and neighbouring countries, and the vaccine strains recommended for the Southern Hemisphere. For this purpose, we firstly analyzed the genetic sequences of the HA and NA genes that were obtained in this study and compared with sequences downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza data (GISAID) database. Further, the co-circulation of IAV and IBV were examined. Finally, we analyzed the NA gene to observe the existence of possible known substitutions that cause reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-microorganisms-08-00591"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-microorganisms-08-00591"><title>2.1. Influenza Surveillance and Sample Collection</title><p>The National Influenza Center (NIC) located in Montevideo, Uruguay, in the Virology Unit of the Department of Public Health Laboratories, Ministry of Health, is the Reference Laboratory for Influenza and other non-Influenza respiratory viruses. Uruguay is a country with a temperate climate, where outbreaks of respiratory viruses usually occur mainly in the autumn-winter period, between April and October. The virological surveillance system is based on the year-round sampling effort and it was carried out in six sentinel centers, including five general hospitals and one children&#x000b4;s hospital strategically located in different regions of the country. Nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasal swabs that were obtained from 5299 hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) associated with influenza and 455 outpatients with clinical evidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) were collected between 2012 and 2019. The ILI surveillance was implemented in 2017. All six ILI sentinel centers were the same from the existing SARI surveillance network.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-microorganisms-08-00591"><title>2.2.

Real time RT-PCR was performed by using a Invitrogen SuperScript&#x02122; III Platinum&#x02122; One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System according to the manufacturer&#x000b4;s instructions, on an Applied Biosystems&#x02122;Step One Plus (Applied Biosystems, USA) thermocycler. Influenza B lineage-specific sets of primers and probes were provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA). Testing was done according to the CDC&#x000b4;s instructions, being enclosed with reagents. In brief, the master mix containing appropiate primers and probe was dispensed into reaction tube plate in a volume of 20 &#x003bc;L, and 5 &#x003bc;L of RNA extracts were added to each well. Negative and positive template controls for all of the primer/probe sets were included in each run. The human Rnase P gene primer and probe set served as an internal positive control for human RNA. Thermocycling real time RT-PCR conditions were as follows: reverse transcription for 30 min at 50 &#x000b0;C, Taq polymerase activation for 10 min at 95 &#x000b0;C, and 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 &#x000b0;C for 15 s, and extension at 55 &#x000b0;C for 30 s.

The RT-PCR reaction was carried out in a Biorad T100 thermocycler with a single reverse transcription step of 42 &#x000b0;C for 30 min, 50 &#x000b0;C 10 min, a pre-denaturation (94 &#x000b0;C) for 2 min, forty cycles (denaturation 30 s at 94 &#x000b0;C, 30 s. of primer annealing al 55 &#x000b0;C, 2 min 30 s of extension al 68 &#x000b0;C), and a final elongation step of 10 min at 68 &#x000b0;C. For the NA gene, a specific primer set was designed for the partial amplification of the NA gene (position 168&#x02212;1386 bp).

Prevalence of Influenza B Viruses</title><p>In the eight-year period studied, the NIC received a total of 5754 samples from the sentinel surveillance. Of these specimens, 217 (3.8%) were confirmed for influenza B virus by real-time RT-PCR. During the entire study period, Victoria lineage viruses were more represented than those that belonged to the Yamagata lineage, accounting for 51% (110/217) and 45% (98/217) of cases, respectively. The remaining 4 % (9/217) could not be attributed to a specific lineage. The 217 IBV ranged from newborn to 88-year old. Influenza B infection was widely distributed across age-groups, with a clear predominance in children and teenagers with more than 60% of total influenza B infections. Those between 5&#x02013;14 years had the highest detection rates among all age groups for both lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00591-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The mean and median ages for the IBV detected were 22 and eight years, respectively. For ILI patients, the highest rate is in the 5&#x02013;9 years group (29.5%, 13/44), followed by children &#x0003c;4 years (20.4%, 9/44) and 10&#x02013;14 years 18.2%, 8/44). We observed that, as the age increased, the circulation of the virus decreased becoming practically null in ages &#x0003e; 39 years. Meanwhile, for SARI patients, we observed two main circulation peaks being the positive rate of influenza B viruses of SARI patients highest in children &#x0003c;4 years (33%, 57/172), followed by &#x0003e;64 years (19%, 33/172). Overall, and even though ILI surveillance was only done during three of the eight years of the study, the proportion of influenza B found was significantly higher than that observed among SARI cases across different groups of age (9.7%, 44/450 ILI and 3.2%, 172/5299 SARI, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Some differences were observed regarding the circulation of both lineages according to age. Although the proportions of cases fewer than 4 years were similar in both lineages (18%, 39/208 B/Victoria, 13% 27/208 B/Yamagata), patients aged between 5&#x02013;14 years were most frequently infected by B/Victoria lineage (22% 46/208 B/Victoria, 11% 23/208 B/Yamagata). However, in ages &#x0003e;24 years B/Yamagata viruses circulated in a higher proportion (21% 45/208 B/Yamagata, 10% 21/208 B/Victoria) (<xref rid="microorganisms-08-00591-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-microorganisms-08-00591"><title>3.3. Interactions among Influenza A and B Viruses</title><p>Fluctuations in the prevalence of influenza A and B were observed during 2012&#x02013;2019. Overall, 14.6% were confirmed influenza cases, of which 36.9% (311/843), 37.4 % (315/843), and 25.7% (217/843) were influenza A/H1N1 pdm09, A/H3N2, and B infections, respectively. Influenza B viruses rarely dominate over influenza A viruses, however in 2012, 2015, and 2017 there was an important circulation of influenza B viruses, reaching 40%, 58% and 47%, respectively, of the circulating influenza virus. The co-circulation of influenza A/H3N2 and B was observed in almost all of the periods studied (2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018). However, in 2013 and 2016, the lowest incidence of influenza B virus infection was detected (2.8% and 4.5%, respectively), along with the highest incidence of influenza A/H1N1 pdm09 (78% and 95%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00591-f002">Figure 2</xref>). </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-microorganisms-08-00591"><title>3.4. Mismatches between Circulating Strains of Influenza B and Vaccine Strains </title><p>Influenza B lineage mismatch was defined as a season when &#x0003e;60% of circulating B lineage virus was different to the lineage that was included in the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) for that season. A partial mismatch was defined if both lineages co-circulated at equal or almost equal proportions (40&#x02013;59%). During 2012&#x02013;2019, Victoria and Yamagata-lineage co-circulated in Uruguay, most of the years, with alternated predominance. However, only one lineage is contained in the trivalent vaccine recommended by the WHO for each season. We evaluated the extent of lineage-level mismatch between the circulating B viruses and those that were included in vaccine formulation for the Southern Hemisphere. The proportion of circulating IBV mismatched to the vaccine strain was calculated based in the total number of successfully lineage-typed specimens. During 2012&#x02013;2019, a high degree of B mismatch in the 2012, 2013, and 2015 seasons (70%, 100%, and 92%, respectively) were observed. It is noteworthy that, in 2013, IBV circulation was very low and only B/Victoria strains were detected. On average, 28% of circulating influenza B was mismatched to recommended influenza B vaccine strain during 2012, 2013, and 2015. During 2017, a partial mismatch (Victoria 57%, Yamagata 43%) was observed, being the vaccine strain from the Victoria lineage.

It is noteworthy that, in 2018, there was no detection of B/Victoria lineage strains in Uruguay, unlike what happened in neighboring countries. The HA gene sequences from 2019 Uruguayan circulating viruses were grouped in subclade V1A.1, within clade 1 A along with 2017, 2018, and 2019 HA sequences from neighboring countries. These subclade viruses were closely related to B/Colorado/60/2017, the vaccine strain recommendation by the WHO to be used in 2019 in the Southern Hemisphere. When comparing to vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008, a series of amino acid changes were observed in the HA1 region. All of the Uruguayan sequences in the 2012&#x02013;2014 seasons shared amino acid substitutions at I146V, whereas the 2015&#x02013;2017 seasons shared amino acids substitutions at I117V and N129D. Interestingly, nine of 10 Uruguayan 2017 sequences shared additional amino acids substitutions V87A and I175V only found in Uruguayan sequences. Although these sequences do not have other substitutions within this cluster that differentiates one from another, the epidemiological information shows different geographic locations and different sample dates for seven of them.

Interestingly, two amino acid substitutions located near antigenic epitopes, V87A and I175V, have been found in 2017 Uruguayan sequences. Unexpectedly, these substitutions have not been found in all other sequences from neighboring countries and included in these studies. We performed the same analysis in the Yamagata lineage. Relative to B/Phuket/3073/2013, there were 15 mutation sites in the HA1 region of our B/Yamagata samples. The most represented substitutions were L172Q, D229N/G, D232N, and M251V, being located near the antigenic epitopes as well as a few mutations in the antigenic epitopes: K116N in the 120-loop area, I150S in the 150-loop area, Y165N in the 160 loop-area, and S202N in the 190-helix area.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5dot2-microorganisms-08-00591"><title>3.5.2.

On average, influenza B viruses accounted for approximately 26% of influenza positive cases during 2012&#x02013;2019. These results were similar to other countries that suggest that influenza B virus contribute significantly to influenza disease [<xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our findings revealed that types A and B influenza viruses almost always co-circulated throughout 2012&#x02013;2019 and they confirm the important role of influenza B virus in the spread of infection in the population. In a study by Glezen P and colleagues [<xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it was suggested that when influenza B activity is intense, it can produce an impact that is similar to that of influenza A. Influenza B viruses rarely dominate in a season, however in 2015, in Uruguay, predominated over influenza A. The increase of influenza B incidence also coincided with a shift in the predominant influenza B lineage (from the Yamagata lineage in 2014 to Victoria lineage in 2015) and clade (from Yamagata clade 2 in 2012 to Yamagata clade 3 in 2014). In 2013 and 2016, the lowest incidence of influenza B virus infection was detected in Uruguay, along with the highest incidence of influenza A/H1N1 pdm09. The absence of influenza B viruses in some season is not unusual, since it is known that the activity of the influenza B virus is highly variable worldwide, without an established pattern that leads to an increase in the size of the susceptible population and that the disappearance of one or both lineages could be related to the genetic variability of the influenza B virus [<xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In some years, influenza B viruses represent strong bottlenecks in the population and they are generally associated with a high prevalence of influenza A virus [<xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Interaction with the influenza A virus might be central in the configuration of the evolutionary dynamics of the influenza B virus and therefore facilitate the change in the dominance or codominance of the lineages between the Victoria and Yamagata lineages [<xref rid="B38-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>During the study period, different patterns of Victoria and Yamagata-lineage B viruses were observed. Regarding the distribution of the different lineages in relation to the age groups of the population studied, our study showed that both the Victoria and Yamagata viruses were more likely to infect patients aged between five and 14 years, which had also been observed in previous studies [<xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, it can be observed that Victoria lineage viruses tend to be distributed according to age with a peak in children under 10 years. Meanwhile, Yamagata lineage viruses frequently show two peaks (in children younger than 10 years and a significant predominance towards individuals over 25 years, preferentially adults over 64 years), as in other countries [<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B43-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, Vijaykrishna and colleagues [<xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] proposed that age difference between Victoria and Yamagata-lineage infections is thought to be due to differences in the molecular aspects of cellular dynamics, which help the viruses to infect the epithelium of the respiratory tract, while Orsi and colleagues [<xref rid="B45-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] proposed a higher reproductive number (Ro) of the Victoria-lineage viruses, which might reduce the mean age of lineage-specific infections. More studies are required to determine whether there is indeed any difference with either of the B lineages in different age groups. Regarding the distribution of influenza B viruses in relation to the surveillance type, the highest proportion of young children (&#x0003c; 4 years) within SARI patients could be due to different behaviors when a child is found to be sick. Children are more likely to be taken to hospital, especially for SARI cases. It is well known that SARI cases in children could lead to respiratory failure. Respiratory Sincitial Virus (RSV) and human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) significantly increase the risk of SARI, especially in children younger than 24 months. [<xref rid="B46-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

The finding from ILI sentinel sites revealed that the influenza positivity rate was high among children aged 5&#x02013;9 years and became practically null in ages &#x0003e;39 years. Interestingly, and even though ILI surveillance was only done during three of the eight years of the study, the proportion of influenza B found was significantly higher than the observed among SARI cases across different groups of age. Some studies have demonstrated that influenza played an important role in the viral aetiologies of ILI cases [<xref rid="B49-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], while other respiratory viruses were essential for the cause of SARI, especially in children [<xref rid="B46-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B51-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the HA and NA sequences of influenza B virus could be divided in two distinct lineages: Victoria and Yamagata. The Victoria lineage can be subdivided into V1A and V1B. The V1A clade was the only detected in Uruguay during 2012&#x02013;2019. The 2012&#x02013;2017 Uruguayan sequences were genetically related to B/Brisbane/60/2008, the vaccine strain recommended by the WHO to be used in the trivalent vaccine during 2012, 2016, and 2017 for the Southern Hemisphere. In 2019, all of the B/Victoria viruses detected in Uruguay belonged to the V1A clade, encoding a deletion of two amino acids (K162 and N163) in the HA protein.They were grouped within V1A.1 subclade and genetically related to B/Colorado/06/2017, the vaccine strain recommended by the WHO to be used in the trivalent vaccine in 2019 for the Southern Hemisphere. Viruses with the double amino acid deletion in HA were detected in the 2016&#x02013;2017 Northern Hemisphere season and have continued to circulate since then [<xref rid="B52-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Unlike Uruguay, the circulation of these strains has been observed in neighboring countries since 2017, extending even further in 2018 and prevailing in 2019 in the South American region.</p><p>The Yamagata lineage can be subdivided into clades 2 and 3. In Uruguay, Yamagata clade 3 was detected since 2014 and the sequences were similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013, the vaccine strain recommended by WHO and included in the trivalent vaccine in 2015 and 2018 for the Southern Hemisphere. Yamagata clade 2 was only found in 2012 in Uruguay, confirming recent reports that indicated the incidence of clade 2 viruses decreased substantially [<xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the co-circulation of Yamagata clade 2 and 3 was detected in neighboring countries between 2012&#x02013;2014. The co-existence of clade 2 and 3 of Yamagata lineage in a region enables these viruses to evolve in multiple dimensions [<xref rid="B39-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the mixing of viruses from consecutive seasons is less seen in Victoria lineage, rather than in Yamagata lineage viruses [<xref rid="B53-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>The hemagglutinin represents a primary target for host neutralizing antibodies. More specifically, the HA1 region contains the receptor-binding sites and the most part of antigenic sites, including the 120-loop, the 150-loop, the 160-loop, and the 190-helix and their surrounding regions [<xref rid="B21-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B54-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In this study, several amino acid substitutions were located in the antigenic epitopes of the Uruguayan viruses sequenced, as compared to their specific lineage vaccine strain. In B/Victoria viruses, mutations were mainly observed in the 120-loop. Mutations in the 150-loop were found until 2015 and no mutations occurred in the 190-helix. Variations in the 160-loop were found since 2019 within all of the Uruguayan HA sequenced. Previous studies show that the 120-loop is one of the sites with greater variability and play a crucial role in stabilizing the HA protein structure [<xref rid="B21-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B55-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Insertions or deletions within the 160-loop region might enable influenza B virus to survive longer without undergoing an antigenic shift [<xref rid="B56-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Meanwhile, in the B/Yamagata viruses, mutations in the four antigenic sites were only found in 2012 HA sequences. The large number of amino acids substitutions in 2012 could be due to the fact that the HA sequences of that year were of a different clade from the vaccine strain clade that was used in those years. The non-existence of amino acids substitutions at antigenic sites in years after 2012 would be somehow confirming the slowly evolving influenza B/Yamagata viruses.</p><p>In some of the years studied, amino acid substitutions were observed outside the known antigenic regions in the HA gene that have only circulated in Uruguay. Moreover, the same samples have unique substitutions in the NA gene. Recent research has suggested the presence of additional antigenic residues outside the known antigenic regions [<xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Amino acid changes in these regions may alter viral antigenicity, and potentially change the evolution direction as new lineages evolve [<xref rid="B54-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These mutations may have contributed to increasing viral fitness. If they contributed to antigenic evolution, changes in these positions might have caused conformational changes affecting the antigenic sites. Moreover, it is important that the activity of the two main surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) be balanced to efficiently maintain the capacity for infection and the release of viral particles [<xref rid="B58-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

Indeed, we show here, that both influenza B lineages circulated almost 2012&#x02013;2019, in different proportions. Mismatches were found between the vaccines and circulating strains. Our findings evidenced that the level of B vaccine mismatch varied during the eight seasons, with the highest impact being observed in 2015. Our data showed that 28% of the influenza B infections that circulated in Uruguay did not correspond to the lineage of the recommended vaccine strain. The potential impact of vaccine mismatch has been broadly investigated and the findings highlighted the effect on the epidemiology of influenza viruses. Furthermore, it was reported that the vaccine efficacy for influenza B was highly reduced when the circulating lineage was not matched with vaccine lineage [<xref rid="B13-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although Uruguay provided the trivalent vaccine free of charge especially those at high risk, the vaccine coverage remained low (on average 24 % and 30% in subjects &#x0003c; 4 years and &#x0003e;64 years, respectively), as it happened in other countries of the region [<xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B67-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The lack of availability of vaccination data and antigenic analysis in our study population limit our possibility to draw any inference on this topic. However, the magnitude of the impact of seasonal vaccine mismatch on influenza epidemiology depends on several factors during a given season and the proportion of each influenza B virus lineage circulating, as reported by Reed and colleagues [<xref rid="B68-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Quadrivalent vaccines developed, which contain strains of both lineages, can be expected to increase the effectiveness of the vaccine and reduce the morbidity and mortality that are caused by the virus. It seems a logical consequence that children might benefit most from the implementation of specific vaccine-based preventive measures, with potential to reduce the burden of disease in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. However so far, only a few countries actually recommend the Quadrivalent influenza vaccination providing the vaccine free of charge [<xref rid="B69-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>Although information for other internal gene segments may represent an important limitation of this study, the results presented provide evidence of heterogeneity and genetic information for estimating the variability of circulating influenza B viruses in Uruguay and the neighboring countries. Further antigenic analysis is needed for assessing the characteristics of the vaccine candidates and the circulating strains, especially those that possess changes at antigenic and glycosylation sites of the hemagglutinin. Comparing the antigenic relationship and amino acid substitutions help to define the appropriate vaccine strains. Another limitation is that we only examined NA mutations in previously described antigenic sites. Susceptibility testing of patient isolates and antiviral surveillance studies, as well as the functional characterization of molecular markers of drug resistance, are needed. Despite the limitations, the surveillance system for influenza B viruses has been proven useful to describe the epidemiological and evolutionary behavior of influenza B viruses that have circulated in Uruguay during the last years and the results demonstrate that the virus is changing, in line with other observations that were reported from other countries [<xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-00591" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-microorganisms-08-00591"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study is one of the first to highlight the prevalence and molecular characteristics of influenza B virus strains, especially the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, which have circulated in Uruguay in recent years. Our findings, like those other studies, confirm the genetic variability of the influenza B viruses and show the importance of systematic epidemiological and molecular surveillance for the effective management of influenza epidemics. Understanding the different evolutionary behavior of the influenza viruses, and how they might interact, is clearly of importance in predicting their future impact on human populations, and may contribute to future vaccine design, and also for better monitoring in surveillance studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Natalia Go&#x000f1;i acknowledges support from PEDECIBA, Uruguay.
