  <p>After searching current scientific literature we have acknowledged that not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world during last 5 months from the time when first cases of COVID-10 infection was detected. Also, there is no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19. Expectations that vaccine against COVID-19 will be produced optimal during at least 10 months to 2 years, and in all current Guidelines most important proposed preventive measures are the same like which one described in Strategic documents of WHO, in statements of Declaration of Primary Health Care in Alma Ata in 1978.</p>
