The respiratory disease that it caused, COVID-19 (stands for coronavirus disease in 2019), has similar clinical symptoms with other two CoV diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS and MERS), of which causative viruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. These three CoVs resulting diseases also share many clinical symptoms with other respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs). Since both CoVs and IAVs are general pathogens responsible for seasonal cold, in the next few months, during the changing of seasons, clinicians and public heath may have to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other kinds of viral pneumonia. This is a discussion and comparison of the virus structures, transmission characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, pathological changes, treatment and prevention of the two kinds of viruses, CoVs and IAVs. It hopes to provide information for practitioners in the medical field during the epidemic season.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronaviruses</kwd><kwd>Influenza A viruses</kwd><kwd>Transmission</kwd><kwd>Diagnosis</kwd><kwd>Therapy</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0120">In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused a pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. It erupted in many other countries in the following months and eventually became a worldwide pandemic. The pneumonia was officially named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. So far, the pandemic is still accelerating. More than 4.3 million people were confirmed infected, 290,000 more people died globally [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the virus transmission is expected to last for more than one year [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. At the same time, other types of coronaviruses and influenza viruses, which have been widespread in the world, may invade human society again during this winter or in other circumstances, circulating together with the SARS-CoV-2 and causing more serious respiratory diseases [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is necessary to investigate whether the simultaneous prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, such as IAVs, can promote the spreading of each other. In addition, because the clinical symptoms caused by CoVs and IAVs infection are very similar to each other [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], it will bring further challenges to clinicians in the timely diagnosis and treatment of patients. This article will summarize and compare the epidemic characteristics, clinical symptoms, treatment, and prevention measures for the diseases which are caused by CoVs or IAVs respectively, hoping to provide a brief comparative information for the clinicians and researchers who are working in the related fields.</p><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Viruses</title><p id="p0125">CoVs are enveloped, single strand positive-sense RNA viruses with a genome consisting of 26 to 32k nucleotides, expressing 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) and four structural proteins, such as spike (S protein), membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>
A, S protein is located on the surface of virus particles, which plays a key role in virus entry into host cells, and is also one of the major targets of antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>]. CoVs are divided into four genera which belongs to Coronaviridae, alpha, beta, delta and gamma CoVs. So far, there are seven CoVs causing human diseases, including three highly pathogenic CoVs (HPCoVs) (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) and four normal human CoVs (abbreviated as HCoVs) (HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the alpha genus, while the other 5 CoVs belong to the beta genus. The genes of S protein from the three HPCoVs form 3 clusters, as shown in the polygenetic tree in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A. Compared with MERS-CoV, the S protein gene of SARS-CoV-2 is a little bit closer to SARS-CoV, as reported they are sharing about 50% identity [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Spike proteins and life cycles of CoV and IAV. 3D models of CoV with spike protein genes based polygenetic tree (A) and summary diagram of the CoV life cycle (B).

Viral proteins were translated by mRNAs through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus system for packaging into mature viral particles with the progeny RNA in the cytoplasm. Then the virions was transported to cell membrane and released by exocytosis [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0135">Similar to CoV, IAV is also an enveloped virus, with genome of a single strand but negative-sense RNA, which is divided into eight segments, encoding 12 proteins, including PB2, PB1, PB1&#x02013;F2, PB1 N40, PA, NP, HA, NA, M1, M2, NS, and NEP/NE2, respectively [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are distributed on the surface of virus particles, which are the basis for subtype classification of IAVs and also play important roles during the process of virus invasion and mature virus releasing [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Like S protein of CoVs, HA and NA are very important targets of antiviral drugs and vaccines [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. In recent 30 years, three subtypes of IAVs, including H1N1pdm09 virus causing 2009 flu pandemic [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and two highly pathogenic avian viruses, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, had caused severe respiratory diseases and resulted in thousands of deaths or high mortality in humans [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The majority subtype of seasonal IAVs is H3N2 [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The polygenetic tree in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C displays the three clusters of HA genes. They show a distinct difference from each other, with the HA gene of H5N1 virus generating more mutations during its transmission as reported [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p id="p0140">Compared to CoV, there are two major differences in the life cycle of IAV. First, the IAV needs to replicate its genome in the nucleus. Secondly, the virions are released by assembly and budding from cellular membrane. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D, IAV binds to receptor &#x003b1;-2,3-linked sialic acid (H7N9 and H5N1) or &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid (H1N1 and H3N2) to form endosome and enters into cell, and the viral RNA was released into the cytoplasm by viral-endosome membrane fusion. Then the viral RNA is imported into the nucleus, and once there starts both virus RNA transcription and replication. After mRNAs and progeny negative-sense RNAs are exported to cytoplasm, the proteins are translated and trafficked to the cell membrane into packaged RNAs. The mature virus then buds from the cells [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Transmission</title><p id="p0145">For the spread of viruses, there are no borders between countries as more and more interactions and cooperation were established worldwide. Since the CoVs and IAVs were identified as the major pathogens for respiratory diseases in last century, they have traveled to many corners of the world [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The transmission and infectivity related information of these viruses were summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>
. There are two seasonal flu viruses included, HCoVs and H3N2 IAV (HCoVs represents four CoVs that cause seasonal cold, HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, for convenience in following discussion, they will be denoted as one CoV in this article.). They usually cause moderate clinical symptoms and spread globally [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The rest of six viruses either show high pathogenicity or are highly transmissible, which could cause much danger for human society. These viruses are called here as HPHTs, which stands for high pathogenicity or highly transmissible viruses. Of the HPHTs, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is accelerated due to its ability to transmit through airborne droplets during the incubation period [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. That it may also transmit between human and animals becomes another challenge in the control of the pandemic [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another two viruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, reported in 2012 and 2003 respectively, caused mortalities of 35% and 9% in patients respectively. Their transmission mostly started after the patients started showing clinical symptoms [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, they could not travel in humans too long before being discovered and controlled. All ages of people were susceptible to these 3 CoVs, but senior people were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and develop more severe clinical symptoms, while mostly younger people were infected with SARS-CoV [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>A summary of transmission of CoVs and IAVs.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Table&#x000a0;1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Viruses</th><th rowspan="2">First circulated</th><th colspan="3">Transmitted by contact via<hr/></th><th rowspan="2">Susceptible age</th><th rowspan="2">Infected people</th><th rowspan="2">Infected countries</th><th rowspan="2">Mortality</th><th rowspan="2">Intermediate host</th><th rowspan="2">References</th></tr><tr><th>Human to human</th><th>Human to animal</th><th>Airborne droplets</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="11"><bold>Highly pathogenic or highly transmissible</bold></td></tr><tr><td>SARS-CoV-2</td><td>2019</td><td>Yes</td><td>NA<xref rid="tbl1fnb" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td><td>Yes</td><td>Most were senior</td><td>Above 2 million by May 30 of 2020</td><td>Global</td><td>About 7% by May 12 of 2020</td><td>NA</td><td>[<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>MERS-CoV</td><td>2012</td><td>Rarely</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>All ages</td><td>2468 by November of 2019</td><td>27</td><td>About 35%</td><td>Dromedary camel, bat</td><td>[<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>SARS-CoV</td><td>2003</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Most were younger</td><td>8447</td><td>32</td><td>9%</td><td>Palm civet, bat</td><td>[<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>H7N9 IAV</td><td>2013</td><td>Rarely</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Most were senior</td><td>1568 by December of 2019</td><td>Mainly in china</td><td>37%</td><td>Avian</td><td>[<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]<break/>[<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>H1N1pdm09</td><td>2009</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Most were younger</td><td>Above 200 million</td><td>Global</td><td>0.001%&#x02013;0.007%</td><td>Swine</td><td>[<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]<break/>[<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>H5N1 IAV</td><td>1997</td><td>Rarely</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Most were younger</td><td>861 (2003&#x02013;2020)</td><td>17 (2003&#x02013;2020)</td><td>53%</td><td>Avian</td><td>[<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]<break/>[<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan="11"><bold>Seasonal</bold></td></tr><tr><td>HCoVs<xref rid="tbl1fna" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td>1966</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>All ages</td><td>up to 20% of cold cases</td><td>Global</td><td>NA</td><td>Bat, mice, cattle, palm civet</td><td>[<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>H3N2 IAV</td><td>1968</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>NA</td><td>Most were senior</td><td>NA</td><td>Global</td><td>NA</td><td>Swine</td><td>[<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fna"><label>a</label><p id="ntpara0015">HCoVs represents the four CoVs which caused common cold, HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fnb"><label>b</label><p id="ntpara0020">NA, data unavailable.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="p0150">Some subtypes of IAVs also resulted in pandemic and caused large number of death tolls. Besides the well documented Spanish flu in 1918, H1N1pdm09 virus spread to 214 countries one year after it appeared in USA in 2009 [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It was noticed that the virus caused more deaths in people who are younger than 65 [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

However, the fact is that the 1918H1N1 virus also caused more deaths in younger people [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. H7N9 and H5N1 viruses were limited in transmission due to the similar reason mentioned above with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

Most often used for treatment of SARS and MERS are ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir. Ribavirin is similar to guanosine and inosine and interfere viral RNA replication, which is more frequently used in combination with interferons to treat chronic hepatitis C infection [<xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>].

Health authorities in China have initiated clinical trials at multiple places in Hubei province to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir on patients.

Besides of China, Gilead Science started phase III trial. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the US are conducting phase II trial.

Before a universal vaccine was successfully developed, it is necessary to switch vaccines strains year by year as the prevalent influenza viruses mutate their genes or change their subtypes very frequently to escape from the immune recognition [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p id="p0240">Up to now, available commercial vaccines against the IAVs those listed in this article are H1N1, H5N1 and H3N2 IAV vaccines, but not H7N9 flu vaccine. For example, a trivalent inactivated vaccine, TIV, produced by Seqirus Inc., usually has H1N1, H3N2 and B subtype viruses. FluMist, produced by Medimmune, Inc, is also used for H1N1 flu vaccine [<xref rid="bib158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. For H5N1 IAV, several inactivated vaccines are approved for human use, such as Audenz produced by Seqirus Inc [<xref rid="bib158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>], Prepandrix produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A [<xref rid="bib160" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. H3N2 virus is usually a seasonal flu subtype in the last 30 years, of which the vaccine has been recommended for injection according to flu surveillance [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><label>7</label><title>Summary</title><p id="p0245">Human CoVs and IAVs share many characteristics, especially in HPHTs. Most of them infect the respiratory tract through direct contact and airway droplets and cause similar clinical symptoms like fever, cough, and sore throat. In contrast, MERS-CoV, H7N9 and H5N1 viruses rarely transmit between humans. SARS-CoV, H1N1pdm09, and H5N1 viruses easily infect younger people. Severe patients usually infected with HPHTs develop bilateral pneumonia, ARDS, respiratory failure, and even death. CT and autopsy showed that the main pulmonary pathological manifestations were DAD, hyaline membrane formation, alveolar and interstitial edema, fibromyxoid exudation, etc. At present, there are no specific and effective drugs or vaccines for the treatment and prevention of CoVs. However, thanks to clinicians&#x02019; and scientists&#x02019; efforts worldwide, some promising progress has been made in the treatment of the diseases. Although there are some drugs and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of IAVs, it is still necessary to further research and develop more effective methods of treatment and prevention to better control the influenza epidemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0250">The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ojcius</surname><given-names>D.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lessons learned from the 2019-nCoV epidemic on prevention of future infectious diseases</article-title><source>Microbes Infect</source><volume>22</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>86</fpage><lpage>91</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32088333</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sref2"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" id="intref0010">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mahase</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Covid-19: outbreak could last until spring 2021 and see 7.9 million hospitalised in the UK</article-title><source>BMJ</source><volume>368</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>m1071</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32179567</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khodamoradi</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moghadami</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lotfi</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Co-infection of coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza A: a report from Iran</article-title><source>Arch Iran Med</source><volume>23</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>239</fpage><lpage>243</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32271596</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in patient with pneumonia, China</article-title><source>Emerg Infect Dis</source><volume>26</volume><year>2020</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref6"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Q.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The clinical characteristics of pneumonia patients coinfected with 2019 novel coronavirus and influenza virus in Wuhan, China</article-title><source>J&#x000a0;Med Virol</source><year>2020</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/jmv.25781</pub-id><comment>[online ahead of print]</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref7"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maier</surname><given-names>H.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bickerton</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Britton</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preface.
