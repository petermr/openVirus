 <p>As large-scale vaccination campaigns are begun or continued with the aim to eliminate yellow fever (YF) epidemics in several countries, estimating disease burden and vaccine impact is timely. We developed two model variants to estimate YF burden in sub-Saharan Africa, each either representing the sylvatic or urban cycle of the disease. Both relied on an ecological niche model fitted to known records of YF in 34 African countries and calibrated using serological survey data. Local numbers of YF infections and deaths were derived while accounting for time-varying vaccination coverage. We estimated vaccine demand and the impact of future preventive mass vaccination campaigns according to various vaccination scenarios. By providing burden and vaccine impact estimates over a range of spatial and temporal scales, and accounting for the specificity of urban transmission, our model can be used to inform the current international strategy to counter the increasing global risk of yellow fever.</p>
