To find more immediately available COVID-19 antivirals, we established a two-tier drug screening system that combines SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell viability assay, and applied it to screen a library consisting 1528 FDA-approved drugs.

In the past two decades, three novel human-pathogenic coronaviruses have emerged to cause epidemics of severe respiratory infection among human, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) since 2012, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. Within just 4 months, the number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has exceeded the total number of cases of SARS and MERS by nearly 100 times, with more than 1.2 million confirmed cases and over 60,000 deaths globally [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The clinical severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. The disease is usually mild in children, but severe infection in immunocompromised and elderly patients may be associated with a crude case fatality rate of about 15 % [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. Patient with severe COVID-19 may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, and other extrapulmonary manifestations such as lymphopenia, diarrhea, confusion, deranged liver and renal function tests, and elevated <sc>d</sc>-dimer, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, and inflammatory marker levels [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A major reason for the poor clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients and difficulty in controlling the expansion of the pandemic is the lack of effective vaccine or antiviral for treatment and prophylaxis.</p><p id="par0010">Similar to other emerging viral infections, the <italic>de novo</italic> development of antiviral drugs would inevitably lag behind the rapid progression of the epidemic [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Drug repurposing is therefore a feasible strategy to quickly identify clinically approved drugs with known pharmacological properties and safety profiles that can be immediately used in clinical trial settings. A number of existing drugs, such as remedsivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nafamostat, camostat, and ivermectin, have been reported to exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or in a very small number of patients [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activities including against SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are mildly immunosuppressive drugs used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and malaria that exhibited 50 % maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) at or above the peak serum concentration (Cmax) achievable with standard dosing in human [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A recent non-randomized small-scale clinical study showed that hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin significantly reduced the viral load and duration of virus shedding in 20 COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nafamostat and camostat are a serine protease inhibitor used in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and reflux esophagitis [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone used in the treatment of various parasitic infections [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, data from well-designed randomized controlled trials for these drugs are not yet available. Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for additional drug compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity among clinically approved drugs. In this study, we first established a robust two-tier drug screening system by combining SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with cell viability assay, and then applied it to screen an FDA-approved drug compound library. We successfully identified a number of drug compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, including bexarotene which has broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral activity and a higher Cmax to EC<sub>50</sub> ratio than most other reported potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Viruses, cell lines, and drug compounds</title><p id="par0015">SARS-CoV-2 HKU-001a (GenBank accession number: MT230904&#x0200b;) was isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient in Hong Kong [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Briefly, VeroE6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well). The cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.500) and then incubated for 1 h for virus internalization. Drugs were added at different time points of the virus replication cycle, including: pre-treatment (From -2 h post infection (hpi) to -1 hpi), co-infection with virus (-1 to 0 hpi) or post-infection (0 to +1 hpi). Dimethyl sulfoxide (0.5 %) was included as a negative control.

VeroE6 cells were used because they robustly support SARS-CoV-2 replication [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Time-dependent observation of CPE development was recorded using different multiplicities of infection (MOI) (1.000, 0.250, 0.063, 0.016, and 0.004). SARS-CoV-2 infection (MOI = 1.000) caused significant CPE in VeroE6 cells as early as 48 h post-infection (hpi) (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
A). At 72 hpi, prominent CPE were detected in the virus-infected VeroE6 cells even with the lowest MOI of 0.004, while the morphology of the non-infected VeroE6 cells remained intact. This observation was in line with the cell viability determined by using the CellTiter-Glo&#x000ae; substrate, which is a reagent that generates a luminescent signal directly proportional to the amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) present and is proportional to the number of metabolically active cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, there was approximately 75 % reduction in cell viability at 48 hpi with MOI of 1.000, 0.250, or 0.063 and at 72 hpi with MOI of 0.016 or 0.004. In the qRT-PCR assay, viral RNA load in the culture supernatant markedly increased by &#x02265;2 logs gene copies per reaction within 24 hpi (&#x0223c;2 logs for 0.004 MOI, &#x0223c;3 logs for 0.016 MOI, and &#x0223c;3.5 logs for 0.063, 0.250, and 1.000 MOI) (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C).

The qRT-PCR assay exhibited the highest signal window (&#x0223c;4 log difference between SARS-CoV-2-infected and non-infected samples) but was laborious, and was thus inefficient as a high-throughput drug compound screening assay. On the other hand, the ELISA (&#x0223c;6 folds) and cell viability assay (&#x0223c;4 folds) also exhibited reasonably high signal differences between infected cells and baseline at 72 hpi and provided a wide signal window. Therefore, we exploited the combination of ELISA and cell viability assay as a two-tier drug screening system for finding potential SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. This combinational screening system is rapid, non-labor-intensive, and can easily exclude false-positive results due to cytotoxicity. Using this newly established system, we screened an FDA-approved drug library containing 1528 drug compounds under the optimized conditions of 0.004 MOI at 72 hpi with each drug concentration fixed at 10&#x003bc;M.
