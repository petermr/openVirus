Summary</div> <p>SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV or Wuhan coronavirus) caused an unprecedented fast-spreading worldwide pandemic. Although currently with a rather low mortality rate, the virus spread rapidly over the world using the modern worldâ€™s traffic highways. The coronavirus (CoV) family members were responsible for several deadly outbreaks and epidemics during the last decade. Not only governments but also the scientific community reacted promptly to the outbreak, and information is shared quickly. For example, the genetic fingerprint was shared, and the 3D structure of key proteins was rapidly solved, which can be used for the discovery of potential treatments. An overview is given on the current knowledge of the spread, disease course, and molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. We discuss potential treatment developments in the context of recent outbreaks, drug repurposing, and development timelines.</p> </div> <div class="abstract" title="abstract"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Wuhan</div> <p id="p0025">In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of an unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, in Hubei province, China. It was speculated that the first patient caught the infection from a seafood market that also traded wild animals. The causing agent was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV). The CoV responsible for the outbreak is now called SARS-CoV-2. The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. The symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic to mild to severe to death.<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> It soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring, as was the case with the previous human CoV. In an unprecedented documented speed, the SARS-CoV-2 travels around the globe, and as of May 15<sup>th</sup> led to &amp;gt;4.5 million infections and 300,000 fatalities. Based on the previous experience with the SARS-CoV outbreak at the beginning of this century, very stringent measures were taken by the Chinese government, and several multimillion-inhabitant cities were isolated and put under quarantine in order to slow the pandemic spread. Different hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 are proposed, including snails, bats, and pangolins.<a href="#bib2"><sup>2</sup></a></p> <p id="p0030">CoVs are a large family of zoonotic viruses and their outbreaks are common to humans, although major outbreaks have been experienced in animals, especially in cattle. Under the electron microscope, they exhibit formations that are reminiscent of the solar corona. The common cold is often caused by human CoVs. They are single-stranded enveloped positive RNA viruses and stand out because of their rather large genome. As with viruses in general, the structure is rather simple. SARS-CoV-2 is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, much less pathogenic than the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV, but more pathogenic than practically harmless HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63. The reported case-fatality rate of COVID-19 is â‰¤3% and is thus rather low as compared with SARS (30%, <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> ). However, the transmission rate (TR) (number of newly infected people per infected person) of 2.5 to 3 is high and accounts for the danger of the current pandemic. For comparison, the TR of the yearly common cold is less than 1.4. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" position="float" id="tbl1"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span> </div></p><p>Some Data to the New and Previous Epi- and Pandemics</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th>Pandemic (Causing Agent) Time</th> <th>Transmission</th> <th>Mortality</th> <th>No. of Infection Cases</th> <th>No. of Death Cases</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Black death (Yersinia pestis)<br /><br />14<sup>th</sup> century</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>&amp;gt;50 million</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Spanish flu (Influenza virus)<br /><br />1918â€"1920</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>10%â€"20%</td> <td>500 million</td> <td>40â€"100 million</td> </tr> <tr> <td>SARS (SARS-CoV)<br /><br />2002â€"2003</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>30%</td> <td>8,000</td> <td>800</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2)<br /><br />Since November 2019</td> <td>&amp;gt;2%</td> <td>â‰¤3%</td> <td>&amp;gt;4,500,000</td> <td>&amp;gt;300,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Swine flu (H1N1 virus)<br /><br />2009â€"2010</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>0.01%â€"0.1%</td> <td>700â€"1,400 million</td> <td>50,000â€"575,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> <p id="p0035">Advice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia have been shared rapidly.<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a></p> <p id="p0040">What are the issues and chances for a rapid approval of a new medicine to treat COVID-19? In principle, there are several potential strategies to pharmacologically fight COVID-19: vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]). The timelines for <i>de novo</i> development of a small-molecule drug are historically &amp;gt;6â€"7 years, and in the best case less than 2 years. Vaccines can be developed much faster, but rapid development in the range of 1â€"2 years is very challenging. Antibodies to support the bodyâ€™s immune system are also a strategy to combat viral diseases. Again, the typical development timelines are several years. Therefore, is there a hope for a drug to come rapidly to the market? A strategy that is promising in the current situation is drug repurposing. Drug repurposing aims to discover novel indication areas for already approved drugs.<a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> The overwhelming advantage of drug repurposing is the potential for much faster market approval because of the already extensive knowledge of the drugâ€™s behavior in humans.</p> <p id="p0045">An expert opinion on the potential for repurposing existing antiviral agents to treat COVID-19, some of which are already clinically evaluated, was recently given.<a href="#bib5"><sup>5</sup></a> Here, we discuss molecular targets of the SARS-CoV-2, some of the known small molecules, and the potential for repurposing existing drugs.</p> </div> <div class="molecularbiologyandtargets" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Molecular Biology and Targets</div> <p id="p0050">Despite the rather large size of the RNA virus genome of ~30,000 bases, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for few proteins (<a href="#fig1">FigureÂ 1</a> ): the structural spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein, which are needed to produce a structurally complete viral particle. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 16â€"17 non-structural proteins (ns1 to ns17), such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">FigureÂ 1</span></a></div>   <p>Scheme of SARS-CoV-2 and Some of Its Molecular Protein Targets</p>   </div> <p /> <div class="3clpro" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
3CLpro</div> <p id="p0055">Both the virus-encoded proteases 3CLpro and PLproÂ are involved in the processing of the two viral polyproteins in a coordinated manner, and thus comprise important drug targets. The structure, function, and inhibition of CoV 3CLpro (also called Mpro) has been recently comprehensively reviewed.<a href="#bib6"><sup>6</sup></a> The 3CLpro is a cysteine protease that cleaves and processes the viral polyproteins.</p> <p id="p0060">SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 96% sequence identity in their 3CLpro. On the basis of the rapidly published virus sequence data, a homology model was created.<a href="#bib7"><sup>7</sup></a> Moreover, an X-ray structure of the C3Lpro covalently bound to a peptidomimetic acrylester (<b>1</b>) is now available (<a href="#fig2">FigureÂ 2</a> , PDB ID <a href="pdb:6LU7">6LU7</a>).<a href="#bib8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">FigureÂ 2</span></a></div>   <p>3D Structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro Bound to a Covalent Peptidomimetic Inhibitor (PDB: <a href="pdb:6LU7">6LU7</a>)</p> <p>The active-site Cys145 is indicated as yellow surface.</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="p0065">Because of the high sequence similarity of different CoV 3CLpros, a lot of previously described inhibitors can be considered to be of great use in the current SARS-CoV-2. A majority of inhibitors of the 3CLpro are covalent in nature, binding to the active-site cysteine (<a href="#sch1">Scheme 1</a> ). Different electrophilic warheads are known, including Î±-halocarbonyl, acrylamides, sulfonyl chlorides, aldehydes (<b>2</b>),<a href="#bib9"><sup>9</sup></a> isatines (<b>3</b>),<a href="#bib10"><sup>10</sup></a> or Î±-ketoheteraromates (<b>4</b>).<a href="#bib6"><sup>6</sup></a> Many of the molecules are rather large and are based on extensive amide chemistry, mimicking part of the peptide substrate of the protease. Moreover, their selectivity toward other potential targets in the human body has not been established. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Scheme 1</span></a></div>   <p>Selected Classes of 3CLpro Inhibitors</p> <p>Warheads interacting covalently with the active-site Cys145 are indicated in red.</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="p0070">Interestingly, some compounds binding to the active site of the 3CLproâ€"using a noncovalent mechanismâ€"have been established. A high-throughput screening (HTS) identified pyrazolidinone (<b>5</b>), which displayed 1,3,5-triaryl substitution patterns, as SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.<a href="#bib11"><sup>11</sup></a> Nitroanilides (<b>6</b>), derived from the drug niclosamide were also found to inhibit 3CLpro.<a href="#bib12"><sup>12</sup></a> Î±-aminoacylamides were identified by an HTS, and a strong stereochemical effect was noted. The simple one-pot accessible scaffold by an Ugi-four component condensation was the key to rapidly generate structure activity relationship (SAR) for the putative P2-P1 and P1 subgroups. An optimized version ML188 (<b>7</b>) was designated as the probe status (<a href="#fig3">FigureÂ 3</a> ). A P3 truncated version of <b>8</b> allowing for significant molecular weight (MW) reduction without diminishing potency was developed as a second probe ML300 (<b>9</b>) with potent enzyme inhibition and cellular activity. These compounds comprise rare examples of a noncovalent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor of moderate MW with good enzyme and antiviral inhibitory activity. However, these molecules suffer from extensive metabolism and rapid clearance. Nonetheless, they are a promising starting point for further drug development.<a href="#bib13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">FigureÂ 3</span></a></div>   <p>Non-covalent Probes Binding to the Active Site of the 3CLpro</p> <p>Above: co-crystal structure of probe ML188 bound to SARS-CoV (PDB: <a href="pdb:3V3M">3V3M</a>).

Outlook</div> <p id="p0165">The recent emergence of the Wuhan CoV (SARS-CoV-2) has put the world on alert. The rapid worldwide spread and the high human-to-human transmissibility, combined with the inability to contain the pandemic, is causing an increasing death toll and also considerable paralysis of the world economy. The COVID-19 could decrease and disappear or could be established worldwide in the human population and reoccur seasonally in future mutations through zoonosis from one of the animal reservoirs. However, it is very likely that in the upcoming years, we will see more outbreaks from CoV and other viruses. The basic, translational, and public health research communities have to prepare for this much better. The outbreak has emphasized the urgent need for renewed efforts to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents to combat CoVs. On the positive side, much new information of the virus biology and the spread was immediately shared, whereas, on the negative side, many past opportunities to develop antivirals against CoVs were not taken, despite a large number of promising approaches and compounds.<a href="#bib47"><sup>47</sup></a> The past decade has shown that CoV outbreaks are regularly reoccurring with more or less health effect on human and livestock. It remains to be hoped that the current pandemic will slow down and end as predicted in summer. Furthermore, it turns out that containment measures are not effective to avoid more severe spread. It remains to be seen whether efficient and long-lasting immunity will develop in the infected population with regard to future outbreaks and whether pharmacological measures can be rapidly developed to be able to treat severely sick people.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="references">
