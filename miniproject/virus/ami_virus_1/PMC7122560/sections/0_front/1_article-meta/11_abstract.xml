 <p>Infectious disease epidemiology is concerned with the occurrence of both infection and disease in populations and the factors that determine their frequency, spread, expression and distribution. Viruses show characteristic infectivity, virulence and pathogenicity. The most well established host factors are age, sex and race, but other host biological and behavioral factors affect acquisition of viral infection and/or its course and manifestations. The physical, chemical and biological environment operates on the virus itself and may also alter the host biological or behavioral response. Viral infections have incubation periods lasting days or weeks, while their pathologic sequelae may not manifest for years or decades. Likewise the degree or intensity of host response and clinical expression may range from largely inapparent to highly lethal. The degree of cell, tissue and organ specificity is high. Common syndromes involve the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems, the liver, and mucocutaneous surfaces. Vertical transmission may produce a variety of congenital and perinatal conditions. Viruses spread by multiple modes, using nearly every bodily surface or fluid as a route of exit or entry, either by direct contact or indirectly through an animal vector or other inanimate vehicle. Different viral Infections occur nearly ubiquitously or sporadically; they may be present continuously throughout a population (endemic) or occur in seasonal rhythm or in unexpectedly explosive form (epidemic). Many viruses are refractory to all known therapeutic agents, while for a few, the increasing number of highly effective agents holds great promise. Vaccines have produced many historical successes including the ultimate goal of eradication, but many viral infections continue to elude effective vaccine development. Major government and private sector programs for treatment and prevention have raised expectations of successful control for certain widespread and serious viral diseases; however, in every case a unique set of scientific, socioeconomic, political and behavioral barriers remains to be overcome.</p>
