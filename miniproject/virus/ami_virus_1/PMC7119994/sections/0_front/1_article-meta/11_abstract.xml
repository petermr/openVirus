 <p>Mathematical tools have been widely applied in understanding the dynamics and control of viral infections. Here we present some fundamental aspects of infection dynamics, starting with acute immunising infections as a case study for herd immunity and other important factors in the spread and control of infection. We then discuss the dynamics of infections with more complex life histories, including chronic infections, and those showing evolution for immune escape. We conclude with a discussion of important gaps in our current understanding of viral dynamics, along with future research needs.</p>
