<p id="p0070">We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the model to the data, and adopt an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to carry out the MCMC procedure. The algorithm is run for 70,000 iterations with a burn-in of the first 50,000 iterations, and the Geweke convergence diagnostic method is employed to assess convergence of chains. The estimation results are given in
