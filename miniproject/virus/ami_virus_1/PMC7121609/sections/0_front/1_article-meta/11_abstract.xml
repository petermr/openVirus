 <p>Most of emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are of animal origin and transmitted under natural circumstances from either, wild or domestic vertebrate animals giving the way of zoonotic infection or epidemics. Zoonotic diseases carry a common ancient history between human and animals as a result of pathogen exchanges involving transgression of the species barrier. Nowadays, several agents have been targeted for their potential to be a major risk for human and animal populations and, have been characterized by their potential to be highly pathogenic and/or transmissible, and lacking of any means of protection. Those agents have been listed as “Select Agents” having the potential to pose a severe threat to both human and animal health, as well as to animal and plant products. Several of the most dangerous agents responsible of viral hemorrhagic fever are review in this chapter including: Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Rift valley fever virus, Kyasanur forest virus, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus.</p>
