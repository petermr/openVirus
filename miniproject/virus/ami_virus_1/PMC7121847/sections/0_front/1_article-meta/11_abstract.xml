 <p id="Par1">Since the first report of a viral disease associated with plants, the fascinating field of virology has evolved and aided mankind altogether. Viral infections are known for inflicting colossal economic losses worldwide in food/work/companion animals. During the last few decades, emergence of a number of new viral diseases in animals, humans and plants has been visualized. Animal disease surveillance and monitoring is essential for the sustainability of healthy livestock production systems internationally. Preparedness for combating the emerging, re-emerging, exotic and transboundary diseases requires comprehensive monitoring and precision detection systems that are pliable under the field situations. With collective and concerted scientific interventions, a few of the animal viral diseases have been stamped out globally or regionally. Rinderpest, popularly called cattle plague, was eradicated from India in 2006 and globally in 2011. Notably, India achieved the disease-free status by OIE in 2014 for African horse sickness (peste equine), a deadly viral disease of equines. Likewise, equine infectious anaemia (EIA) and equine influenza (EI) have been controlled to a greater extent in India by adopting surveillance and monitoring along with zoo sanitary measures. Overall, there is a need for developing the ‘One World, One Health’ concept using multidisciplinary, regional and international networking to control major economically important emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases of humans and animals. This chapter describes various strategies for combating viral diseases of livestock.</p>
