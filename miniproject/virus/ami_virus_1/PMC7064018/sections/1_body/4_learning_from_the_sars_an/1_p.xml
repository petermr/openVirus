 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. The SARS epidemic in 2002-2003 emphasized that correct management of symptomatic cases within and outside hospital was crucial for containing the epidemic. In fact, the correct management of several imported cases of SARS into Vancouver (British Columbia, Canada), resulted in stopping secondary transmissions within the city. In contrast, inadequate application of infection control measures in Toronto (Ontario, Canada) and Taipei (Taiwan) led to significant hospital clusters and further spread

MERS has no natural epidemic potential in the community and the transmission rate R0 in humans remains significantly below 1. Nevertheless, its potential to cause large and fatal hospital outbreaks is well established
