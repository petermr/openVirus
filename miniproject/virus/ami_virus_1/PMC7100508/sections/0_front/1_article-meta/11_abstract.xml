 <title>Summary</title>
 <p>Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed significant threats to the public health and life in China. Unlike the other 6 identified coronaviruses, the SARS-Cov-2 has a high infectious rate, a long incubation period and a variety of manifestations. In the absence of effective treatments for the virus, it becomes extremely urgent to develop scientific and standardized proposals for prevention and control of virus transmission. Hereby we focused on the surgical practice in Neurosurgery Department, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, and drafted several recommendations based on the latest relevant guidelines and our experience. These recommendations have helped us until now to achieve ‘zero infection’ of doctors and nurses in our department, we would like to share them with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight 2019-nCoV infection.</p>
