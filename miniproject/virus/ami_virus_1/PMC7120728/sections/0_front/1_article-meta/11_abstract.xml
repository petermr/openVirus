 <p id="Par1">Influenza, measles, SARS, MERS, and smallpox illnesses are caused by highly infectious viral pathogens that induce critical illness. These biologically diverse viruses enter and replicate within host cells triggering viral- and host-mediated damage that results in pneumonia and multiorgan failure in severe cases. Early case identification and strict infection control limit healthcare transmission. Vaccination allowed smallpox eradication and limits global measles and seasonal influenza mortality. While SARS-coronavirus (CoV) is no longer circulating, MERS-CoV and zoonotic influenza viruses, with pandemic potential, remain persistent threats. Supportive critical care is the mainstay of treatment for severe disease due to these viral infections.</p>
