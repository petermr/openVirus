 <p id="Par1">Immunocompromised patients such as those undergoing solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are at substantial risk for infection with numerous pathogens. Infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) are well-described complications of transplantation. As viruses previously believed to be quiescent through widespread vaccination (e.g., measles and mumps) reemerge and molecular diagnostic techniques are refined, rare and emerging viral infections are increasingly diagnosed in transplant recipients. This chapter will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and potential antiviral therapies for these viruses in the transplant population.</p>
