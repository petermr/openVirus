 <p>RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, and poliovirus replicate with very high mutation rates and exhibit very high genetic diversity. The extremely high genetic diversity of RNA virus populations originates that they replicate as complex mutant spectra known as viral quasispecies. The quasispecies dynamics of RNA viruses are closely related to viral pathogenesis and disease, and antiviral treatment strategies. Over the past several decades, the quasispecies concept has been expanded to provide an adequate framework to explain complex behavior of RNA virus populations. Recently, the quasispecies concept has been used to study other complex biological systems, such as tumor cells, bacteria, and prions. Here, we focus on some questions regarding viral and theoretical quasispecies concepts, as well as more practical aspects connected to pathogenesis and resistance to antiviral treatments. A better knowledge of virus diversification and evolution may be critical in preventing and treating the spread of pathogenic viruses.</p>
