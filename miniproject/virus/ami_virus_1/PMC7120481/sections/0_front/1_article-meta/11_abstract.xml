 <p id="Par1">Hepatitis C is a global public health problem. Globally, an estimated 170 million persons (3 % of the world’s population) have been infected with the hepatitis C virus, and an estimated 350,000 persons die annually from complications of chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, an increasing trend in hepatitis C mortality in the USA was observed over the last decade; in 2007, mortality associated with hepatitis C surpassed mortality associated with HIV. As the hepatitis C epidemic continues, it is increasingly important to accurately measure hepatitis C-related morbidity and mortality in order to inform public health programs and policies and prioritize and evaluate prevention efforts. This chapter provides an overview of hepatitis C surveillance and methods used in the USA with some examples from other countries.</p>
