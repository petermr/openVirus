 <p id="Par1">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) causes disease and mortality to piglets worldwide. Most vaccines used to combat the disease have been ineffective live attenuated virus vaccines. Research has emerged showing both the spike (S) and membrane (M) proteins of the virus have potential for use as subunit vaccines. This research has been largely undertaken using plants as expression platforms, with some promising candidates having emerged.</p>
