 <p>Surveillance has been defined as the systematic collection of data pertaining to the occurrence of diseases, the analysis and interpretation of these data, and the dissemination of consolidated and processed information to contributors, programs, and other interested persons. A wide variety of data sources are used for surveillance purposes. Some data sources were designed for the purpose of surveillance while other data sources are used secondarily for surveillance. To improve the timeliness and quality of surveillance data while simultaneously minimizing cost, surveillance networks and Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) were developed. Surveillance networks allow developing countries to participate in surveillance, establishing early warning of outbreaks. HIEs facilitate access to and retrieval of patient clinical data to support more efficient, timely, effective, equitable, and safe healthcare and to enhance case reporting. Seroepidemiology is the systematic collection and testing of blood samples from a target population to identify current and past experiences with infectious diseases by means of biological markers. Data from serological surveys can reveal total burden of current and past, as well as apparent and inapparetnt infections. Surveillance and seroepidemiology have provided critical epidemiologic information to support public health policy at the local, national, and international levels.</p>
