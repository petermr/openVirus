 <p id="Par1">Foodborne viral illness, resulting from the consumption of contaminated food or water containing pathogenic viruses, remains a major public health problem globally with substantial economic impact. Major challenges regarding recognizing, detecting, characterizing, and effectively responding to foodborne viral threats to health exist. Adequate health crisis management is largely dependent on early detection of potential public health threats, which is hampered by changing trends in disease outbreaks, from localized clusters of disease in confined populations to dispersed outbreaks with excellent opportunity for further transmission. In addition, no precise and consistent global baseline syndrome and diagnostic surveillance information exists. An integrated multidisciplinary approach with a combination of sustained pathogen syndrome and diagnostic surveillance, genomics-based, and standardized global analytical networks gathering clinical, epidemiological and genetic data alike would be required to understand the dynamics of foodborne viral infection and to mitigate potential effects of future threats. A huge global effort in virus syndrome and diagnostic surveillance may be justified in the light of global health impact in general, and timely with the development of new metagenomics tools that hold the promise of not only identifying viral pathogens, but possibly the complete microbiome in a single assay.</p>
