<p>If one surveys contemporary news headlines, one will encounter a litany of thought‐pieces on what is to blame for the COVID‐19 pandemic. It is said to be a result of Chinese food policy, of the proliferation of air travel, of a slow quarantine response by Western nations, or of Spring Breakers. Yet, each ‘master key’ falls short of explaining the global scale of the phenomenon. The causes proposed aim to achieve normative control over the world; one way or another they are complicit in an anthropocentric humanism. The world we inhabit, however, is the result of far more than human processes, whether these be as individuals, communities, or nation‐states. To see COVID‐19 as emerging only from a failure of legislation or social policy confuses tools of ethical 
 <italic>evaluation </italic>with diagnostic 
 <italic>analysis. </italic>In our paper, we outline an alternate mode of analysis, namely one through overlapping, provisionally‐stipulated systems emerging from a nonhumanist perspective. The COVID‐19 pandemic poses a rare opportunity to elaborate such an analysis because of the different systems (e.g. biological, agricultural, economic, political, legislative, technic, etc.) that contribute to the outbreak and by the speed with which the powerful asymmetric shocks of the pandemic have appeared. To develop our mode of analysis, we will first demonstrate why conventional humanist models of diagnosis are inadequate, paying specific attention to the cosmopolitan assumptions latent in perceiving COVID‐19 as, for example, resulting from a failure in legislation. We will then develop a logic of systems, their interaction, and how forces within one may be transformed to influence another. Our contribution will benefit from a dialogue between two of the most penetrating contemporary nonhumanist researchers, Bernard Stiegler and Keith Ansell‐Pearson. On the shambles of the failure of the alternatives, we recommend this mode of analysis because it gives due place to complexity and abandons the search for a single culprit.
