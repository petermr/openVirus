<p id="par0070">Changes in the immunological profile of COVID-19 patients have more or less similar patterns. This may however, vary depending on the demographic and other clinical conditions of the patients. Generally, a decreased count of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, monocytes and platelets with increased count of neutrophils were recorded (

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are critical in antiviral immunity (

 <xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr">Whitmire and Ahmed, 2000</xref>). In other words, the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses to a viral infection require distinct costimulatory pathways for activation that in turn play an important role in determining the number of effector T cells that survive to become memory T cells (
 <xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr">Whitmire and Ahmed, 2000</xref>). Again, specific T cell responses against influenza virus were attributed to the protective immunity provided by the cells by limiting duration and severity of the disease (
