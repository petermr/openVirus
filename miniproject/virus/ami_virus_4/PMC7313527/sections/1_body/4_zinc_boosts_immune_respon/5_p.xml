<p id="par0105">In addition to these host immune responses that are directly or indirectly triggered by the Zn, the same element also acts directly on the infectious pathogens more specifically for a number of viruses.

 <sup>2+</sup> inhibit the replicative cycle of a number of viruses including influenza virus (

In those viruses, Zn is known to inhibit the viral entry, blocking of polyprotein processing, or inhibition of viral RdRp activity (
