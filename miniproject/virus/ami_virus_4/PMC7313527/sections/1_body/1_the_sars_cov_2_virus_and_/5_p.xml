<p id="par0065">The polycistronic ribosome machinery of the infected cell synthesizes non-structural proteins (NSPs) of the SARS-COV-2 and assemble into the replicase-transcriptase complex. Following replication, the envelope proteins are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cells to finally enter into the Golgi compartment. Consequently, the viral genomic RNA is packaged into the nucleocapsid and then envelope proteins are incorporated during the budding step to form mature virions For detail please see review articles (
