<p id="par0135">Among the active medicinally bioactive constituents from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>, thymoquinone has been given more emphasis (

 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Houghton et al., 1995</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil and thymoquinone were found to produce antinociceptive effects through indirect activation of the supraspinal μ1- and κ-opioid receptor subtypes (

 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Lantz et al., 1991</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest that opioid receptors and ACE share similar inhibitory molecules. Hence it is not impossible that thymoquinone might also block ACE2. In other words, thymoquinone may block the SARS-CoV-2 entry via ACE2 in pneumocytes.
