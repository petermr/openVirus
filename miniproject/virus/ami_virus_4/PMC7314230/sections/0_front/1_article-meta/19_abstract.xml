 <p>Coronaviruses are a major pathogen for adults, causing up to one-third of community-acquired respiratory tract infections in adults during epidemics. Although the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) targets preferentially patient’s lungs, recent data have documented that COVID-19 causes myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, exacerbation of heart failure and acute kidney injury. Studies show that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similar to its predecessor SARS-CoV, engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor. ACE2 is also expressed in the heart, providing a link between coronaviruses and the cardiovascular system.</p>
