<p id="p0095">HCoV-229E was discovered in 1966 and is a less pathogenic Alpha coronavirus that appears to have crossed species barriers to infect humans decades or centuries ago. Like SARSCoV-2, HCoV-229E enters the cell via TMPRSS2 to infect humans. However, HCoV-229E is missing the SARS F1 fusion loop. Thus HCoV-229E is comparable to the single FL2 structure shown in the less pathogenic Rubella virus in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. An attenuated SARS-CoV-2 virus suitable for a vaccine can be created by replacing SARS-CoV-2 amino acids 816–855 with HCoV-229E amino acids 923–982. This replacement will maintain the AEC-2 tissue specificity and host range, yet it will effectively disturb fusion loop mechanism to reduce the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 to the level of HCoV-229E. An alpha-beta hybrid virus may be immunologically necessary, since prior studies have shown that immunity after inoculation to HCoV-229E may disappear within a year. Although surveys for 229E antibodies in adults in the United States range from 19 to 41%, there are many individuals, who despite possessing an anti-HoCV-229E antibody, can subsequently experience reinfection and illness
