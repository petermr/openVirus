<p id="p0090">Concentrated EDTA solutions suitable for use in nebulizers and mechanical ventilators can be used to directly test that EDTA can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection with relative safety based on prior studies of asthmatics and the long history of adding EDTA 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> to nebulizer treatments. While the lung airways of asthmatics may be more sensitive to the bronchoconstriction effects of EDTA, prior studies on asthmatics indicate that 2.4 mg/ml of EDTA causes, on average a tolerable 20% drop in FEV1 and adding concentrated EDTA to a standard Albuterol nebulizer set-up should mitigate most EDTA induced bronchoconstriction. As a treatment example, assuming the volume from a standard dropper is approximately 0.06 ml and the 0.5 M EDTA concentrate, 2 drops of a concentrated 0.5 M solution, which contains approximately 23.26 mg EDTA/ml, is added to 2.5 ml of nebulizer diluent (saline or saline/Albuterol) would result in approximately 2.8 mg of EDTA per treatment. Nebulizer treatments can be repeated in accord with the chosen B
 <sub>2-</sub>agonist protocol or as tolerated. A local compounding pharmacy can prepare the 0.5 Molar EDTA concentrate as follows; Add 186.1 g of disodium ethylene tetraacetate·2H
 <sub>2</sub>O to 800 ml of H
 <sub>2</sub>O. Stir vigorously on a magnetic stirrer. Adjust pH to 8.0 with NaOH (~20 g of NaOH pellets). Dispense into aliquots and sterilize by autoclaving. It is noteworthy that the disodium salt of EDTA will not go into solution until the pH of the solution is adjusted to ~8.0 by the addition of NaOH. Additionally, an “Off-Label” use of an FDA approved parenteral EDTA drug for nebulizer use may include dilution of Calcium Disodium Versenate, (200 mg/ml) to achieve a target dose of 2.4 mg per aerosol treatment with or without a Beta2-agonist as tolerated.
