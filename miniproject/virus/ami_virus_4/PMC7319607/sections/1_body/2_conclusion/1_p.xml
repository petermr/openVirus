<p id="p0105">Searching for the viral mechanisms to elucidate why asthma patients appear resistant to COVID-19 infection uncovered evidence for the key role of calcium in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection. First, a new computer sequence analysis of SARS-COV-2/COVID-19 revealed two unrecognized calcium-dependent fusion loop domains. Second, the substrate recognition sites for the requisite cell surface protease TMPRSS2 have a conserved SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain and a LDLRA (LDL receptor class A) that utilize calcium. Analysis of nebulizer solutions typically used by asthma patients, for example Metaproterenol, revealed the presence of an excipient called EDTA, a calcium-chelating agent. Triangulating these, the data converges on the previously unrecognized critical importance calcium for effective SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, and how calcium chelation by EDTA may prevent infection. Here while EDTA is only a single drug, it can still disrupt 2 key steps in the AEA-COV-2/COVID-19 infectious process. Accordingly, repurposing EDTA from excipient to therapeutic nebulized drug with or without Beta-2 agonist supplementation logically becomes a new treatment for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 patients. The potential to utilize EDTA to both reduce COVID-19 transmission and treat infection through relatively safe modalities that include nebulizer or mechanical ventilator misting of EDTA solutions (in conjunction with Albuterol/Metaproterenol to minimize bronchoconstriction if needed) and adding EDTA to hygienic products warrant further investigation(s). As either an “Off-Label” or formal IRB protocol, the clinician can measure the clinical response of nebulized pharmaceutically sterile Na2EDT dissolved in normal saline at a range up of to 1·2 to 12·8 mg/mL for the treatment of COVID-19 patients on respirators or with stand-alone nebulizers. When administering nebulized EDTA, the clinician should monitor for signs of bronchial constriction, and administer Albuterol/Metaproterenol as needed. Patients not on a respirator can be similarly treated with Na2EDTA solution through a nebulizer facemask under direct medical supervision, and if tolerated, the more stable patients may be treated at home or as outpatient with a portable nebulizer/mask and Na2EDTA solutions. Finally, an alpha–beta hybrid virus replacing F1 and F2 fusion loops with HCoV-229E amino acids 923–982 can maintain the AEC-2 tissue specificity and host range, yet it will effectively disturb fusion loop mechanism reduce the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 to the level of HCoV-229.</p>
