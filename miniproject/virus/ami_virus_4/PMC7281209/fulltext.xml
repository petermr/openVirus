Introduction</title><p>Influenza viruses are disease-causing agents belonging to the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal flu epidemics almost every year around the world. Influenza A viruses (IFVs) infect a broad range of hosts, including humans, pigs, dogs, horses, and birds, and they are known to evolve into highly pathogenic strains. The emergence of novel IFVs have been known to cause pandemics in recent history, such as the influenza pandemic of 2009, and the potential emergence of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strain into a pandemic remains a global health concern [<xref rid="B1-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition to influenza viruses, coronaviruses, such as the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the new SARS-CoV-2 have also recently emerged as threats to global health, thereby necessitating new control strategies against emerging viral infections.</p><p>Antivirals and vaccines are the primary tools for controlling viral diseases. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir are often used for the treatment of influenza virus infections. However, drug-resistant influenza strains have been reported [<xref rid="B2-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although vaccines are indispensable to the prevention of influenza, the current vaccine design has several limitations: vaccine production using embryonated chicken eggs takes over 6 months, and manufacturing vaccines against avian influenza viruses such as the H5N1 subtype is often difficult because of its high pathogenicity in chickens. To overcome the disadvantages related to neuraminidase inhibitors and vaccine production, other types of drugs that exhibit both anti-influenza virus activities and different mechanisms of action such as stimulating the immune system or inhibiting viral adsorption are needed. </p><p>Seaweeds have been traditionally consumed by people in East Asia. Recent studies have shown that seaweeds have health-promoting properties that make them suitable as functional foods. Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide from brown seaweed, has been successfully isolated and has been reported to have anti-influenza virus activity [<xref rid="B4-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The intake of fucoidan has also been shown to increase the production of anti-influenza antibodies [<xref rid="B6-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, sulfated polysaccharides may be able to both reduce viral replication and increase virus-specific antibody production.</p><p><italic>Monostroma nitidum</italic> (<italic>M. nitidum</italic>) is a green alga that grows in shallow waters along the coasts of Japan. Rhamnan sulfate (RS) is another sulfated polysaccharide found in green seaweed [<xref rid="B8-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and it has recently been identified as a main component of <italic>M. nitidum</italic> [<xref rid="B8-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The main repeating unit of RS consists of rhamnose with a sulfate-group substituent that forms long linear chains with branched side chains [<xref rid="B10-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

They are considered as the immune sensors of the intestine, owing to their ability to transport luminal antigens and bacteria [<xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Peyer&#x02019;s patches are covered by specialized cells called microfold cells (M cells) that capture antigens from the lumen and present the antigens to antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages can also directly sample the lumen by extending dendrites through transcellular M cell-specific pores [<xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although RS has a high molecular weight, it may be incorporated into Peyer&#x02019;s patches through M cells to stimulate immune activity. However, there is currently no evidence on the incorporation of RS into Peyer&#x02019;s patches through M cells.</p><p>In this study, we first aimed to show the antiviral activities of RS against a broad range of viruses (enveloped and non-enveloped) in vitro. Next, we focused on the characterization of the antiviral effects of RS against IFV infection in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show histological evidence that RS molecules could bind to M cells in the intestinal epithelium of mice. Our findings suggest that RS is a potential candidate for development into an anti-influenza therapeutic agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-marinedrugs-18-00254"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-marinedrugs-18-00254"><title>2.1. Effects of RS on In Vitro Replication of Enveloped and Non-Enveloped Viruses</title><p>To assess the antiviral spectrum of RS, we examined its effects on the growth of different host cells and on the replication of different viruses. Representative enveloped viruses (herpes simplex virus 1, HSV-1; HSV-2; human cytomegalovirus, HCMV; measles virus; mumps virus; IFV; human immunodeficiency virus, HIV; and human coronavirus) and non-enveloped viruses (adenovirus, poliovirus, coxsackie virus, and rhinovirus) from different taxonomical groups were used in this study. The half-maximal cell growth inhibitory concentration of RS for each cell type (CC<sub>50</sub>) and the half-maximal effective concentration of RS for each virus (EC<sub>50</sub>) were determined (<xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The selectivity indices (SIs) against the viruses were calculated (SI = CC<sub>50</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>) and are also presented in <xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. SI values higher than 10 were considered suggestive of antiviral activity. RS showed potent antiviral activities against enveloped viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, measles virus, mump virus, IFV, HIV, and human coronavirus) based on their SIs. On the other hand, RS showed little or no antiviral activity against the non-enveloped viruses (adenovirus, poliovirus, coxsackie virus, and rhinovirus).</p><p>The SI values of RS when added during viral infection (<xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>A) were higher than the values obtained when RS was added immediately after infection (<xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>B) for all the enveloped viruses except for HIV. These results suggest that RS has antiviral effects against these enveloped viruses and that RS interferes with the early steps of viral replication, including viral attachment to and penetration into the host cells. In order to characterize the antiviral activity of the RS, its effects on IFV replication were subsequently evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-marinedrugs-18-00254"><title>2.2. In Vitro Anti-Influenza Virus Targets</title><p>To clarify the most sensitive step of IFV replication in the presence of RS, time-of-addition experiments were performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f001">Figure 1</xref>, pretreating host cells for 3 h prior to viral infection did not markedly inhibit IFV replication. In addition, no marked inhibition of viral replication was observed when RS was added during virus infection at 1 h, 3 h, or 6 h post-infection. RS suppressed virus production most efficiently only when added during infection for 1 h and at the same time of infection and throughout the subsequent incubation.</p><p>These results of time-of-addition experiments suggested that the antiviral targets might be early events including virus adsorption to the host cell surface and/or virus penetration into host cells. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of RS on the early steps of viral replication, we determined whether it could inhibit IFV adsorption and penetration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Treatment with 20 and 50 &#x003bc;g/mL RS markedly inhibited IFV adsorption to Madin&#x02013;Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). Viral penetration was also inhibited by RS in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>b), but the effects of RS on viral penetration were lower than its effects on viral adsorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b). These results show that RS targets the IFV adsorption and penetration steps of viral replication in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-marinedrugs-18-00254"><title>2.3. Effects of RS on Body Weight and Mortality in Immunocompetent and Immunocompromised Mice</title><p>To show the effects of RS treatment on immunocompetent and immunocompromised IFV-infected (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/50 &#x003bc;L) mice (<italic>n</italic> = 16&#x02013;21 per treatment group), we induced the immunocompromised state by frequent injections with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Among 16&#x02013;21 mice, we used 6&#x02013;10 mice to evaluate the effects of RS or oseltamivir on body weight and lethality both on immunocompetent and immunocompromised IFV-infected mice. In the control group (orally administered with water), the immunocompetent mice without 5-FU treatment (5-FU (-) mice) and immunocompromised mice with 5-FU treatment (5-FU (+) mice) showed approximately 20% and 30% reduction in body weight, respectively, 8 days after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b). RS-treated mice with and without 5-FU treatment showed approximately 20% and 25% reduction in body weight, respectively. The 5-FU (-) mice administered with oseltamivir showed no marked weight loss.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that RS obtained from <italic>Monostroma nitidum</italic> exerted potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of enveloped viruses including IFV, HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, measles virus, mumps virus, HIV, and human coronavirus (<xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). RS showed high selective toxicity against IFV proliferation based on our calculated SI values. Furthermore, RS exhibited more potent antiviral activity when added before infection than when added after infection. Through in vitro experiments, we have demonstrated that the targets of RS in the IFV replication cycle are adsorption to and penetration into the cells. However, based on the results that show that RS interferes with the early steps of IFV infection, we failed to evaluate the effects of topical administration in vivo. A model to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and the prevention of IFV infection by the topical administration of RS may be designed to further examine the effects of RS on influenza in the future.</p><p>Heparin is a sulfated polysaccharide that is known to bind a glycoprotein, gp120, which is located on the HIV envelope [<xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Fucoidan also binds gp120 and has anti-HIV activity [<xref rid="B27-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. RS has also been reported to bind the capsid of enterovirus 71 [<xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The ionic interaction between the sulfated polysaccharide molecule and the viral glycoprotein is believed to be the main mechanism for viral inhibition; the RS derived from <italic>M. nitidum</italic> in this study may also bind viruses through a similar mechanism. We speculate that the molecular target of RS on the influenza virus is hemagglutinin (HA), which is a glycoprotein that is found on the viral envelope and contributes to host cell binding. Analysis of the interaction between RS and HA will have to be performed in future studies to verify this hypothesis.</p><p>To analyze the effects of RS on IFV infection in vivo, we performed IFV infection experiments in mice. Our results showed that the oral administration of RS led to an early improvement of influenza symptoms based on the reduction of influenza virus titers in normal mice and the suppression of body weight loss in FU-treated mice. In another animal experiment, the intramuscular injection of RS derived from <italic>M. latissimum</italic> exerted a therapeutic effect on enterovirus replication [<xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, this study is the first to report the efficacy of orally administered RS against viral infection.</p><p>Studies have shown that whereas influenza virus shedding in nasopharyngeal secretions can be controlled within a few days in immunocompetent patients, longer durations of viral shedding have been observed after the onset of symptoms in immunocompromised patients [<xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

In this study, the immune-suppressed state of animals was induced by frequent subcutaneous injections of an anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil [<xref rid="B32-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, progressive weight loss owing to virus infection continued for a longer duration, and the recovery from weight loss was markedly prolonged in the immunocompromised animals as compared to the immunocompetent mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b). The severity of influenza associated with immunosuppression was also reflected in the increased virus production in the 5-FU-treated mice 3 days after virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f004">Figure 4</xref>). RS treatment resulted in more rapid weight recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f003">Figure 3</xref>b) and in protection from death of the animals (<xref rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Since RS is a high molecular weight substance, it is unlikely to be transported to the respiratory mucosa, where influenza virus proliferates in vivo. Oseltamivir suppresses virus proliferation in the body, but it also suppresses virus-specific antibodies, whereas RS suppresses virus growth and promotes the production of virus-specific antibodies. Based on these results, we speculated that orally administered RS has stimulatory effects on the intestinal immune response. Considering that RS is a macromolecule, we focused on the M cells in Peyer&#x02019;s patches that can incorporate large molecules, including bacteria [<xref rid="B33-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since the Peyer&#x02019;s patch, a lymph node organ associated with the small intestine, is important for inducing antigen-specific intestinal immune response, RS will have to be transported into the Peyer&#x02019;s patch through the M cells. The polysaccharide &#x003b2;-glucan is known to be transported by M cells into Peyer&#x02019;s patches [<xref rid="B34-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], thereby enhancing intestinal immunity and stimulating immunoglobulin A (IgA) production [<xref rid="B35-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide, is also known to stimulate natural killer cells and Peyer&#x02019;s patch cells [<xref rid="B36-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Fucoidan is known to be absorbed into the body from the intestine, but the detailed route of adsorption is unknown [<xref rid="B37-marinedrugs-18-00254" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this study, as part of elucidating the mode of action of RS in vivo, we investigated the localization of FITC-labeled RS in the mouse intestine. Our results revealed that orally administered RS passed through M cells about 30 min after administration and was incorporated into the Peyer&#x02019;s patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-18-00254-f006">Figure 6</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study that captures the behavior of RS in vivo.</p><p>Taken together, we have shown that RS has an antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses, such as HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, measles virus, mump virus, IFV, HIV, and human coronavirus. Although we have not tested on other types of coronaviruses yet, we suppose that RS might also exert an antiviral effect on them through a similar mechanism. Further examination shows that RS inhibits the early steps of influenza virus infection and enhances neutralizing antibody production. RS is also able to protect immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice from lethal influenza challenge. We also demonstrate that RS is incorporated into the Peyer&#x02019;s patch through the M cells, which possibly accounts for its ability to enhance antibody production. Therefore, RS may be a potential tool for combatting influenza virus infection and other enveloped viruses. Future studies may be conducted to further examine its effects on other enveloped viruses and for other strains of influenza viruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-marinedrugs-18-00254"><title>4.

Viable cell yields were determined by the trypan blue exclusion test. The inhibition data were plotted as dose&#x02013;response curves, from which the 50% cell growth inhibitory concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) was obtained. In the antiviral assays, the plaque yield reduction assay was employed except for human coronavirus, adenovirus, and HIV. Cell monolayers in 48-well plates were infected with the virus at a dose of 0.1 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell at room temperature. After 1 h of viral infection, the monolayers were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C. Samples were added during infection and throughout the incubation period or immediately after virus infection. Virus yields were determined by plaque assay after 1 day of incubation for HSV-1, HSV-2, measles virus, mumps virus, poliovirus, coxsackie virus, and IFV, and after 5 days of incubation for HCMV. For anti-human coronavirus and anti-adenovirus assays, cells were infected with the virus at 0.01 TCID<sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per cell and incubated in the medium for 3 days.

Therefore, the mode of action of RS may be different from that of currently approved drugs such as oseltamivir. Further, it seems that a resistant virus against RS hardly appears, even after long-term use. Future studies are needed to further characterize the effects of RS on different types of enveloped viruses to support its role as a potential antiviral candidate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported in part by Yuto Nomura and Saya Hasegawa for preparing cryosections.
