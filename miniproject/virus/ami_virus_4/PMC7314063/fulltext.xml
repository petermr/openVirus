Therefore, different scientific discovery strategies need to be connected, to generate a rational treatment which can be made available as rapidly as possible. This relies on a solid theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and host responses, which is coupled to the practical experience of clinicians that are treating patients. Because SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), targeting ACE2 to prevent such binding seems an obvious strategy to combat infection. However, ACE2 performs its functions outside the cell and was found to enter the cell only by angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed. This means that preventing uptake of ACE2 into the cell by blocking AT1R would be a more logical approach to limit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. Since ACE2 plays an important protective role in maintaining key biological processes, treatments should not disrupt the functional capacity of ACE2, to counterbalance the negative effects of the infection. Based on known mechanisms and knowledge of the characteristics of SARS-CoV we propose the hypothesis that the immune system facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication which disrupts immune regulatory mechanisms. The proposed mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes disease immediately suggests a possible treatment, since the AT1R is a key player in this whole process. AT1R antagonists appear to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AT1R antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of angiotesnin II and, in addition, they might even be involved in preventing the cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ACE2 function. AT1R antagonists are widely available, cheap, and safe. Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system</kwd><kwd>Angiotensin receptor blockers</kwd><kwd>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-lifecycle</meta-name><meta-value>PAP</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organizaton (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease COVID-19 outbreak to have evolved to a pandemic, once more emphasizing the need for preventive and curative treatments. In this COVID-19 pandemic, time pressure is extreme, and the race to find a cure and effective prevention is on. Science must be swift, and conclusions must be drawn from the limited knowledge at hand, acting on everything that has been learned from previous outbreaks that may bear similar characteristics.<boxed-text id="pvaa053-BOX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><p>Translational perspective</p><p>We hypothesize that the immune system facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell, while the virus is bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This causes extracellular ACE2 deficiency, which disrupts immune regulatory mechanisms. Since angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) appears to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell and also aggravates the disrupting mechanism of angiotensin II (AngII), AT1R antagonists seem to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AT1R antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of AngII and may prevent cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ACE2 function. AT1R antagonists are widely available, cheap, and safe. Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.</p></boxed-text>Human coronaviruses cause &#x0223c;30% of upper respiratory tract infections but are rarely lethal. Occasionally, however, some strains emerge that are life-threatening, having caused past epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as the current emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Because SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), targeting ACE2 to prevent such binding seems an obvious strategy to combat infection. However, ACE2 performs its functions outside the cell and was found to enter the cell only via angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R)-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed. Since ACE2 plays an important role in maintaining key biological processes, the deficiency of this enzyme may have severe consequences.</p><p>There is much discussion about the role of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system (RAS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some authors claim that the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="pvaa053-B1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> This is due to the observation that among the more severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a larger number of individuals had hypertension and diabetes.<xref rid="pvaa053-B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2&#x02013;5</sup></xref> A recent report in the <italic>Journal of Travel Medicine</italic> suggests the same, namely that ACEIs and ARBs might actually both increase the risk of a COVID infection, since they both increase ACE2 levels.<xref rid="pvaa053-B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> This is based on the descriptive analysis of 1099 patients, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections, from Wuhan China, that found more severe disease outcomes in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and chronic renal disease. This suggested that, since all the patients with such a diagnosis have an indication for treatment with ACEIs or ARBs, the increased risk of these groups is due to these treatments. This, however, assumes that increased levels of ACE2 are associated with increased viral uptake. Considering the fact that ACE2 acts outside the cell and was found only to enter the cell via AT1R-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed,<xref rid="pvaa053-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> the extracellular expression of ACE2 may very well be inversely related to viral uptake. Also, Danser <italic>et al</italic>. explain that there are no data to support the notion that ACEIs or ARBs facilitate coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression, either in animal experimental or in human research.<xref rid="pvaa053-B8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> On the contrary, animal data even support that elevated ACE2 expression, as observed in patients treated with an ARB, might confer potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.</p><p>In the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, Vaduganathan <italic>et al</italic>. discuss the potential beneficial effects of ACEIs and ARBs in COVID-19.<xref rid="pvaa053-B9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> They state that SARS-CoV-2 appears to down-regulate ACE2 functions and that it has been postulated that ACE2 deficiency induces unabated AngII activity, which may be in part responsible for organ njury in COVID-19.</p></sec><sec><title>ACE2 and angiotensin II</title><p>AngII, as part of the RAS system, plays an important role in body fluid homeostasis and inflammatory responses.

By converting AngII to Ang(1-7), it ends the AngII-induced proinflammatory response. AngII, in turn, induces cellular internalization of ACE2 by endocytosis and its degradation in lysosomes.<xref rid="pvaa053-B7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> ACE2 thus regulates and antagonizes AngII actions, while AngII simultaneously decreases the expression of membrane-bound ACE2. Although much is known about this homeostatic-type interaction, steering towards a healthy equilibrium, rather than an exacerbation of inflammation, a complete description of the regulatory mechanisms is still lacking.

AT1R facilitates the endocytosis of membrane-bound ACE2 at the cell surface and delivers it to the lysosomes for degradation.

Therefore, it is suggested that, during active SARS-CoV-2 infection, AT1R-mediated ACE2 destruction plays a deleterious role, promoting both viral uptake and AngII-induced inflammation. Destruction of NO by superoxide radicals further induces the AngII-mediated deterioration, leading to lung injury and lung oedema.</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of ACE2 disruption on other organs</title><p>Since ACE2, in addition to expression in lung alveolar epithelium, is also expressed in other organs, such as the intestine, kidney, and heart,<xref rid="pvaa053-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> COVID-19 can also cause morbidity and mortality originating from disruptions of these organs.

It has indeed been reported that AT1R antagonists inhibit the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 in the lung, which mediate the release of cytokines and contribute to acute lung injury.<xref rid="pvaa053-B36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Since the most important mechanism leading to pathology is the uncontrolled AngII activity, leading to increased activation of AT1R which appears to be involved in viral uptake, treatment actions should be aimed at preventing or inhibiting this. AT1R antagonists are therefore the ideal candidates.<xref rid="pvaa053-B37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> AT1R antagonists are expected to decrease AngII activity and reduce AT1R-induced uptake of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2 while preserving ACE2 functions.</p><p>Several AT1R antagonists have already been on the market as antihypertensive drugs for many years, are inexpensive, widely used, and have virtually no side effects, which make them the ideal treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

On the other hand, the expected treatment effect will probably depend on the phase of the disease in which the treatment is initiated. In the early phase, it might be expected that treatment with an AT1R antagonist may completely prevent the excessive inflammation related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, by restoring ACE2 function and thereby preventing viral load accumulation. On the other hand, when the disease reaches the &#x02018;point of no return&#x02019;, when viral replication has exhausted cellular metabolites and the inflammatory response has caused too much damage, AT1R antagonists may not be able to prevent further deterioration.</p><p>It has been suggested that there might also be a potential harm in blocking the RAS system in SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="pvaa053-B40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> It was postulated that the supposed up-regulation of ACE2 might lead to these deletorious effects.

However, concerns arise regarding the possible disruption of the AngII&#x02013;ACE2 equilibrium, due to the gycosylation on ACE2. Therefore, research on chloroquine as a preventive treatment option should be inititated before it can be introduced and indeed several chloroquine prevention trials in healthcare personnel have already been started.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant ACE2</title><p>Since ACE2 exerts such beneficial actions, it is tempting to assume that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the excess of exogenous ACE2, thereby preventing it from entering the cell.

Although the rationale seems promising, the biggest concern with these drugs are the severe side effects, of which secondary infections are the most important. In addition, these treatment options are rather expensive and, therefore, not attractive for widespread use in the early phase of the disease.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Research</title><p>Research on the hypothesis that AT1R antagonists are suitable treatment options for COVID-19 should consist of randomized controlled clinical trials, investigating the effect of an AT1R antagonist compared with usual care or placebo. Considering the proposed disease mechanism in which increasing AngII levels induce increased viral uptake, we believe that the treatment will be most effective when started within 5 days of infection. Treatment with AT1R antagonists can be easily implemented in the elderly, since they are a cheap and safe option, because of their widespread use. Once the decision is made not to admit a patient to hospital or to give treatment with mechanical ventilation, there are no other treatment options for this group of patients. Secondly, clinical data specifically concerning AT1R antagonists compared with other antihypertensive medication should be investigated with regard to their relationship with the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent article by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. showed that among 1128 hypertensive individuals admitted to hospital because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, individuals using either ACEIs or an AT1R antagonist were less prone to have severe disease.<xref rid="pvaa053-B45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Currently 11 randomized controlled trials with AT1R antagonists are registered. Most studies will include hospitalized patients and only two studies will include non-hospitalized patients. Most studies use modest to low dose short-acting AT1R antagonists and only three studies use higher doses of AT1R antagonists. One study is paerticularly designed for the elderly, &#x02265;65 years of age (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="pvaa053-T1" ref-type="table">1</xref></italic>).

Increased AngII induces activation of AT1R, causing more uptake of SARS-CoV-2 and increasing ACE2 deficiency, thus maintaining and exacerbating a non-specific immune response, consisting of cytokine-induced inflammation. This non-specific immune response is an attempt to reduce the viral load, while the specific immune response is mounted. Unrestrained AngII eventually causes death by respiratory distress induced by excessive inflammation and its deleterious effects on other organs. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2-induced mortality is promoted by three mechanisms: (i) increased AngII induces endocytosis of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2, leading to ACE2 deficiency and viral replication; (ii) ACE2 deficiency prevents the priming of an adaptive immune response by lack of NO; and (iii) Ang II induces an increase in viral load leading to an increased innate immune response and a further increase in AngII levels. Therefore, treatments should aim at preventing the AngII &#x02018;storm&#x02019; in an early phase of the infection, restoring the modulation of NO, and preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. All these mechanisms are targeted by AT1R antagonists. They may reduce morbid inflammatory distress and provide an environment to facilitate an effective, virus-specific adaptive immune response.</p><p>
