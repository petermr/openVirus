 <p id="Par1">The last day of 2019 delivered the first report to the World Health Organization (WHO) about a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Subsequent investigations identified the new comer, a novel coronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and thus was termed as SARS-CoV-2. Being very contagious, the new virus led the era of “COVID-19” which is the acronym of “coronavirus disease 2019,” evoking an imminent threat to global health security with unprecedented devastating challenges to human kind. In this article, we provide a molecular overview on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and summarize tremendous efforts that have been made to develop a rapid confirmatory diagnostic test for COVID-19. The diagnostic performances of the available tests are analyzed based on the best current information from the early research.</p>
