The main strain comes from severely affected patients needing intensive care, ventilators, and other medical equipment currently in short supply. Although the virus has the ability to infect people of all ages and socioeconomic status, severe symptoms and mortality occur primarily in frail older adults, and they represent most of the patients overloading the hospitals.</p> <p>Because those most affected are the frail older adults, I propose to add geroscience as a new tool to our strategy against COVIDâ€�19. There is no doubt that a longâ€�term approach to this crisis involves the rapid development of vaccines and other prophylactics. But unfortunately, this takes time, and in the meantime the frail are dying. Geroscience posits that all diseases affecting primarily older adults, even diseases as disparate as cancer and heart disease, have as a common (and major) cause the declining function and resilience that often accompanies the aging process.<a href="#jgs16489-bib-0001">1</a> This is true for chronic diseases, but it is also true for acute ones such as COVIDâ€�19. Weakened resilience lowers our capacity to respond to the physiologic challenge of an acute infection. Importantly, preclinical work is already showing that interventions addressing the basic biology of aging, such as elimination of senescent cells<a href="#jgs16489-bib-0002">2</a> or inhibition of nutrientâ€�sensing mechanisms,<a href="#jgs16489-bib-0003">3</a> can have a positive effect on the ability of a variety of preclinical models to withstand both chronic and acute challenges. Some are already being tried in the clinic, and it is imperative that these approaches be further advanced rapidly.</p> <p>For example, we should be testing the ability of senolytics (drugs that preferentially kill senescent cells) as a way to mitigate the cytokine storm that is widely believed to be at the core of why frail older adults are more susceptible to serious outcomes including death. Senescent cells accumulate in people as a consequence of age and disease, and they secrete multiple cytokines (the soâ€�called senescentâ€�associated secretory phenotype [SASP])<a href="#jgs16489-bib-0004">4</a> that cause inflammation, activating resident macrophages and other elements of the innate immune response. As a result, when a virus or other acute insult activates this already alert innate immune system, a deadly cytokine storm might occur. Preliminary data in mice and other models indicate that killing senescent cells with these senolytic drugs alleviates the problem.<a href="#jgs16489-bib-0002">2</a> This needs to be tested immediately in animal models challenged with COVIDâ€�19, and shortly, in controlled clinical trials in patients. It is important to emphasize that senolytics do not directly target the mechanism of pathogenesis of this (or any other) virus, or even the immune system. They target the aging process itself. However, it is possible that attenuating the nonspecific cytokine storm exacerbated in frail older adults affords time for the patient to develop a better and stronger antigenâ€�specific immune response to COVIDâ€�19 or other pathogens.</p> <p>Other geroscience approaches currently under consideration include inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway of nutrient sensing.<a href="#jgs16489-bib-0003">3</a> Inhibition of this pathway with a combination of everolimus (a derivative of rapamycin) and RTB101 (a catalytic site mTOR inhibitor), was shown to be effective in increasing antibody titers against influenza vaccination.<a href="#jgs16489-bib-0005">5</a> In phase 2 trials in adults 65â€‰years of age and older, RTB101 upregulated panâ€�antiviral gene expression, decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines, and decreased the incidence and severity of laboratoryâ€�confirmed viral respiratory tract infections including coronavirus infections. Although a recent large phase 3 trial of RTB101 failed to reach its primary end point, that point was not the incidence or severity of viral respiratory tract infections. Importantly, both everolimus and RTB101 have been shown to be well tolerated in older adults at the doses and frequency used in these studies. Again, the approach here is not either to attack this specific virus or to boost the immune system by specific targeting; rather, the approach is to improve health including immune health by targeting one of the main pillars of aging biology.</p> <p>Of note, this geroscience approach is not specific to COVIDâ€�19, but once tried and proven, it would be effective against any future pandemics or epidemics. As a note of caution, senolytics and other geroscienceâ€�based approaches would not limit infection rates. They would only protect the frail against the more severe consequences of the disease including death. Thus the geroscience approach needs to be viewed as an adjuvant to the current approaches, not a replacement.</p> <p>COVIDâ€�19 is the largest pandemic in decades, but it is not unusual. We have been there before with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as the seasonal flu. In each case, a large mobilization of research and health resources resulted in effective treatments and/or prophylactics including vaccines. This is an appropriate response, but it is not sufficient. In the long run, we will succeed in our efforts against COVIDâ€�19, but in a few years we will be confronted with a new challenge, in the form of another virus that has succeeded in zoonotic transmission, and the cycle will begin again. Of note, the geroscience approach is not â€œageistâ€�: the affected individuals are not those â€œchronically old,â€� but rather those that are â€œphysiologically oldâ€� through loss of function and resilience, irrespective of their chronological age.</p> <p>Viewed more globally, the problem is that our approach to medicine is reactive rather than proactive and focused on diseases rather than improvement of health and resilience. As a general approach, modern medicine focuses on developing treatments against chronic diseases such as cardiovascular or cancer or diabetes, to try to redress damage already produced, and there is a relatively scarce effort at improving the individualâ€™s ability to fight those diseases, other than through diet and exercise.</p> <p>In the case of COVIDâ€�19, the frail older adults are the most affected, in part because they often already present with multiple morbidities, in the form of more than one chronic disease. And then the complications get exacerbated by the sudden appearance of yet one more disease: acute infections with SARSâ€�CoV2. In such patients, addressing any of their comorbidities (including COVIDâ€�19) amounts to playing a game of whackâ€�aâ€�mole. You take care of disease 1, only for disease 2 to become the major issue. This is not the case with geroscience, which is disease blind, in that it aims to improve the hostâ€™s defenses, irrespective of the challenge at hand, so the same strategy can be rapidly deployed in future epidemics.</p> <p>Because the immediate problem at hand is a virus attacking mainly the respiratory tract, naturally the focus has been on the immune system and the lungs. We need to continue those efforts to reduce the incidence and severity of the pandemic. But protecting the more vulnerable among us will require a different approach. Here I have proposed a more general strategy that should serve us to fight not only the current COVIDâ€�19 epidemic, but also all those that are yet to come. We have been successful in fighting pandemics and epidemics in the past, and no doubt we will continue to be successful. However, the current approach of addressing each onslaught as it occurs does not seem to be a particularly effective strategy. Geroscience is a better solution.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
