 <p>Respiratory viruses are responsible for a variety of clinical syndromes including the common cold, acute otitis media, laryngitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, influenza-like illness, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is primarily clinical and is further supported by laboratory techniques such as antigen detection, serology, and nucleic acid detection. Preventive strategies are based on avoidance of risk factors and, in case of influenza, vaccination. Treatment modalities include over-the-counter and non-specific remedies along with a small number of specific antiviral medications such as the influenza neuraminidase inhibitors or palivizumab against respiratory syncytial virus.</p>
