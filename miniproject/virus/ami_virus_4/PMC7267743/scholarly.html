Abstract</div> <p>Since the first cases of atypical pneumonia linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, were described in late December 2019, the global landscape has changed radically. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and at the time of writing this review, just over three million individuals have been infected with more than 200,000 deaths globally. Numerous countries are in â€˜lockdownâ€™, social distancing is the new norm, even the most advanced healthcare systems are under pressure, and a global economic recession seems inevitable. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the aetiological agent. From experience with previous coronavirus epidemics, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2004 and 2012 respectively, it was postulated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor is a possible port of cell entry. ACE2 is part of the renin-angiotensin system and is also associated with lung and cardiovascular disorders and inflammation. Recent studies have confirmed that ACE2 is the port of entry for SARS-CoV-2. Male sex, advanced age and a number of associated comorbidities have been identified as risk factors for infection with COVID-19. Many high-risk COVID-19 patients with comorbidities are on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, and this has sparked debate about whether to continue these treatment regimes. Attention has also shifted to ACE2 being a target for future therapies or vaccines against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss COVID-19 and its complex relationship with ACE2.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

Introduction</div> <p>In these unprecedented times, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a severe impact globally. Most countries have implemented strict â€˜lockdownâ€™, and social distancing and isolation of the elderly and vulnerable are advised. At the time of writing this review, just over three million individuals have been affected globally with more than 200,000 deaths.<sup><a href="#bibr1-0004563220928361">1</a></sup> The global infection curve has not flattened, with new infections continuing to rise. Although the pandemic originated in China, the epicentre shifted to Europe, and presently the most affected country is the United States of America (USA).</p> </div> <div class="covid-19" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Timeline</div> <p>The first cases of atypical pneumonia linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China were described in late December 2019. China announced an outbreak on 31 December 2019 and closed the market once it became apparent that this was the place of origin. In early January 2020, investigations by Chinese authorities continued, contacts were traced and managed and the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified. On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus was announced as the cause of the outbreak,<sup><a href="#bibr2-0004563220928361">2</a></sup> and on 10 January 2020, China shared the viral gene sequence to allow the development of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic kits.<sup><a href="#bibr3-0004563220928361">3</a></sup> The first case outside China was confirmed in Thailand, and strict screening measures, travel restrictions and the lockdown of Wuhan were implemented.<sup><a href="#bibr4-0004563220928361">4</a></sup> The first case in the USA was announced on 20 January 2020<sup><a href="#bibr5-0004563220928361">5</a></sup> and the first cases in Europe were reported in France on 24 January 2020 in individuals with a travel history to the Hubei Province, China. Subsequent human-to-human transmission followed, and cases with no travel history were reported.<sup><a href="#bibr6-0004563220928361">6</a></sup> Africa reported its first case on 14 February 2020 in Egypt. Since then, the number of cases has risen dramatically (<a href="#fig1-0004563220928361">Figure 1</a>).</p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1.</span></a></div>   <p>A timeline illustrating the most notable events of the COVID-19 outbreak.Source: World Health Organization (WHO).</p>   </div> </div> <div class="epidemiologyandpathogenesis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Epidemiology and pathogenesis</div> <p>This is the third coronavirus outbreak in as many decades.<sup><a href="#bibr7-0004563220928361">7</a></sup> The previous two were severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 which had mortality rates of 10% and 37%, respectively.<sup><a href="#bibr8-0004563220928361">8</a></sup> The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2, â€" although lower compared to SARS and MERS, seems to have a more devastating effect globally.</p> <p>The SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded RNA genome enveloped in a lipid membrane embedded with glycoprotein spikes giving the impression of a crown â€" hence the name coronavirus (CoV). RNA viruses use an error-prone RNA polymerase for replication and therefore have high mutation rates and can easily mutate during epidemics adapting to local environment to facilitate transmission.<sup><a href="#bibr9-0004563220928361">9</a></sup> However, these mutations are part of the virus life cycle and should not impact outbreaks.<sup><a href="#bibr10-0004563220928361">10</a></sup></p> <p>Zhu etÂ al. extracted viral RNA from respiratory samples of three patients admitted in Wuhan,<sup>2</sup> and on 7 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention identified a novel betacoronavirus from one of the samples. They described 85% sequence homology with bat SARS-like CoV which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003.<sup><a href="#bibr2-0004563220928361">2</a>,<a href="#bibr3-0004563220928361">3</a></sup> The virus was originally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and later changed to SARS-CoV-2. This is the seventh member of the coronavirus family. Of the six previously described CoVs, four cause no more than minimal common cold symptoms in humans. The other two members are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</p> <p>All CoVs have zoonotic origins, with bats considered the natural reservoir hosts.<sup><a href="#bibr3-0004563220928361">3</a></sup> In SARS-CoV-2, the sequence identity of pangolin origin CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is 99%, and this raised the question whether the virus is of pangolin origin.<sup><a href="#bibr11-0004563220928361">11</a></sup> The natural hosts, namely bats, have a limited inflammatory response as seen by lower interleukin (IL)-1Î² concentrations and adequate type I interferons, giving rise to a generalized anti-inflammatory milieu and an ability to limit excessive inflammatory response.<sup><a href="#bibr12-0004563220928361">12</a></sup> Interestingly, this may also explain batsâ€™ relatively long lifespan of 30â€"40â€‰years.<sup><a href="#bibr12-0004563220928361">12</a></sup> Type I interferon is known to assist with antiviral control. CoV cannot infect humans unless the virus undergoes mutation and recombination in animal hosts.</p> <p>SARS-CoV-2 is a highly virulent virus. The original infection distribution in mainland China was found to be 71.45% in patients 30â€"65â€‰years of age and only 0.35% in patients less than 10â€‰years old.<sup><a href="#bibr13-0004563220928361">13</a></sup> It is easily transmissible, with initial studies finding that each infected person is capable of infecting another 2.2 individuals.<sup><a href="#bibr4-0004563220928361">4</a></sup> The virus is stable on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces for up to 72â€‰h,<sup><a href="#bibr14-0004563220928361">14</a></sup> further enhancing its ability to spread. The relatively long incubation period worsens the situation, as individuals may be asymptomatic carriers for up to two weeks, thereby releasing the virus in their surroundings in a process called â€˜viral sheddingâ€™.</p> <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are respiratory. Transmission is via droplets (directly, and on surfaces) and direct contact. SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in stool which may point to a possible faeco-oral route of transmission.<sup><a href="#bibr5-0004563220928361">5</a>,<a href="#bibr13-0004563220928361">13</a></sup></p> </div> <div class="riskandcomorbidity" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Risk and comorbidity</div> <p>Although COVID-19 may present mildly as a flu-like disease or even be asymptomatic, some patients develop significant cardiovascular and other adverse effects. According to present data, 81% of infected individuals have only mild flu-like symptoms and recover within two weeks, 14% have severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and 5% become critically ill.<sup><a href="#bibr15-0004563220928361">15</a></sup> These differences in presentation are thought to be due to viral load, age and the presence of comorbidities.<sup><a href="#bibr12-0004563220928361">12</a></sup> As many carriers may be asymptomatic and an underestimated source of transmission,<sup><a href="#bibr13-0004563220928361">13</a></sup> effective screening and contact tracing are important to identify high-risk individuals, advise self-isolation where transmission risk is high and trace possible cases to limit community spread. Children may also be possible carriers of asymptomatic infection. Lu etÂ al. described that children under 10â€‰years old may be asymptomatic in 15.8% of cases.<sup><a href="#bibr16-0004563220928361">16</a></sup></p> <p>The elderly are considered high risk. This may be due to an aging immune system with concomitant lymphopaenia and decreased CD4-count and T-cell regulation.<sup><a href="#bibr12-0004563220928361">12</a></sup> Elderly people have a propensity to excessive autoimmune and inflammatory responses which may be exacerbated by COVID-19 infection.<sup><a href="#bibr12-0004563220928361">12</a></sup> Male patients and those with associated comorbidities are also at increased risk.</p> </div> <div class="someoftheearlycases" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Some of the early cases</div> <p>Risk factors for complicated infection were identified in early studies. Most of these corroborated the increased risk associated with age, male sex and certain comorbidities. The studies also described several laboratory and clinical markers that can be used to determine prognosis.</p> <p>The first study reported 41 cases admitted early in January 2020 in Wuhan, China. The median age of 49â€‰years (there were no adolescents or children), 73% were male and 66% had exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market. Of this cohort, 13 (32%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Lymphopaenia, increased D-dimer levels, increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased high-sensitivity troponin-I (hs-TnI) and increased inflammatory cytokines indicated poor prognosis and outcome.<sup><a href="#bibr8-0004563220928361">8</a></sup></p> <p>Another early study described 99 hospitalized cases in Wuhan. The average age was 55â€‰years, most were male and 49% had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. Age, obesity and comorbid illness were associated with increased mortality, and concern was expressed about individuals with compromised immune function such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), increased age, diabetics or those on immunosuppressive therapy.<sup><a href="#bibr17-0004563220928361">17</a></sup></p> <p>A subsequent study of six family members in Shenzhen China who had returned from a visit to Wuhan described the first person-to-person transmission of the virus.<sup><a href="#bibr18-0004563220928361">18</a></sup></p> <p>Yang etÂ al. described the clinical course and outcomes in 710 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including 52 who were critically ill. In the critically ill, the mean age was 59.7â€‰years, 67% were male, 40% had comorbidities and 61.5% had died at 28â€‰days (median time sevenâ€‰days). Non-survival risk was associated with advance age and comorbidities.<sup><a href="#bibr19-0004563220928361">19</a></sup></p> <p>Li etÂ al. collected demographic information, exposure history and illness timelines on 425 of the initial confirmed cases in Wuhan. The median age was 59â€‰years and 56% were male. As 55% of cases were linked to the original Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, this was evident of human-to-human transmission. They described a doubling of cases every 7.4â€‰days and suggested a 14-day observation or quarantine period for exposed persons. They described that each infected person spread the virus to an average of 2.2 people they come in contact with. As none of their cases were children, they postulated that children may be less likely to be infected or have milder symptoms.<sup><a href="#bibr4-0004563220928361">4</a></sup></p> <p>Ruan etÂ al. examined factors associated with increased mortality in 150 patients from Wuhan. They collected demographic, clinical and laboratory data and found that age, the presence of comorbidities or secondary infections, and increased cardiac Tn, C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 concentrations were predictors of fatal outcome.<sup><a href="#bibr20-0004563220928361">20</a></sup></p> <p>The cytokine storm occurs in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19. This is defined as a hyperinflammatory state characterized by a fulminant and fatal increase in inflammatory cytokines with subsequent multiorgan failure.

ACE2 in inflammation and disease</div> <p>When angiotensin II binds to the AT1 receptor, vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis and proliferation follow leading to hypertension, cardiac fibrosis, thrombosis and ARDS.

This is a common feature of atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Stimulation of AT1 also leads to upregulation of adhesion molecules and interferes with insulin signalling leading to insulin resistance. ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy were found to decrease circulating CRP, and this is thought to be due to decreased angiotensin II stimulation of AT1.</p> <p>Disruption of ACE2 in mice leads to severe cardiac contractility defects, increased angiotensin II concentrations and the expression of hypoxia-induced cardiac genes. When ACE was also decreased, this cardiac phenotype was rescued. However, loss of ACE2 did not affect blood pressure or kidney development in these mice, and it was postulated that ACE could potentially compensate for loss of ACE2. Yet, even when these mice were treated with ACE inhibitor, there was a similar reduction in blood pressure as in wild type; therefore, ACE2 has no apparent direct effect on blood pressure.<sup><a href="#bibr25-0004563220928361">25</a></sup></p> <p>A strong association between RAS and cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders and acute lung injury was demonstrated in mice with acid aspiration lung injury.

The expression of ACE was unchanged leading to a marked increase in angiotensin II, as its formation is upregulated by ACE. Therefore, ACE promotes disease through increased angiotensin II, and ACE-deficient mice were partly protected against acid-induced lung injury. Recombinant ACE2 and AT2 receptor expression protected mice from severe lung disease in this scenario.<sup><a href="#bibr38-0004563220928361">38</a></sup> The inactivation of ACE on an ACE2 knockout background rescued the mice from severe lung failure.

When mice infected with H5N1 were given recombinant ACE2, the virus-induced lung injury was ameliorated.<sup><a href="#bibr55-0004563220928361">55</a></sup></p> <p>The use of intravenous ACE inhibitors and ARB in experimental animals increases ACE2 expression in the cardiopulmonary circulation systems, causing a possible increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.<sup><a href="#bibr56-0004563220928361">56</a></sup> Severe COVID-19 outcomes were described in patients with existing hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.<sup><a href="#bibr57-0004563220928361">57</a></sup> The question was asked whether their current treatment regimens were increasing their risk for infection.</p> <p>Theoretically, if ACE2 activity in cell membranes decreased, it should reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. But, this also decreases the protective effects of ACE2 in various organ systems where ACE2 is expressed. Angiotensin II may contribute to organ damage in COVID-19,<sup><a href="#bibr58-0004563220928361">58</a></sup> and concentrations were found to correlate with viral load and lung injury.<sup><a href="#bibr23-0004563220928361">23</a></sup> Downregulation of ACE2 in the lung tissue may facilitate neutrophil infiltration, leading to angiotensin II accumulation and RAS activation.<sup><a href="#bibr54-0004563220928361">54</a></sup></p> <p>When COVID-19 binds ACE2 and enters the cell, the expression of ACE2 is downregulated. This downregulation essentially â€˜removes the brakesâ€™ from angiotensin II and possibly induces local activation of immune cells. In lungs, decreased ACE2 in alveolar type II cells leads to surfactant deficit and the development of lung injury.<sup><a href="#bibr59-0004563220928361">59</a></sup> Although an increase of ACE2 may lead to higher cell infection rates and proliferation of the virus, it may be beneficial in patients with lung injury and withdrawal may be harmful especially in high-risk patients.<sup><a href="#bibr54-0004563220928361">54</a></sup></p> <p>In a study on acid-induced lung injury in mice, ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV worsened lung injury. The induced lung injury improved with the use of ARBs, and the findings are suggestive that SARS-CoV exacerbates lung injury by decreasing ACE2, and that it is also reversible by ARBs.<sup><a href="#bibr46-0004563220928361">46</a></sup></p> <p>An increase in ACE2 in heart tissue may be cardioprotective. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 could possibly influence the fine balance between angiotensin II and angiotensin (1â€"7), whereas treatment could block RAS and protect the heart and other organs.<sup><a href="#bibr37-0004563220928361">37</a></sup></p> <p>Cardiac tissue function may be compromised by the increase in angiotensin II to angiotensin (1â€"7) ratio.

However, the significance of ACE2 expression and its effect on COVID-19 pathogenesis and mortality are uncertain.<sup><a href="#bibr39-0004563220928361">39</a></sup></p> <p>Therefore, do the benefits outweigh the risks? A joint statement issued on 17 March 2020 found that no experimental or clinical evidence demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients using ACE inhibitors or ARB was available and that urgent additional research is needed.

Potential COVID-19 treatment involving ACE2 system</div> <p>Since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasis has been on finding possible treatment modalities.

Decreasing ACE2</div> <p>Downregulation of ACE2 was proposed as a possible treatment to reduce susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. However, the ensuing relatively unopposed action of angiotensin II could lead to worsening hypertension, inflammation, thrombosis and adverse lung and cardiac outcome.<sup><a href="#bibr41-0004563220928361">41</a></sup> A study by Kuba etÂ al. determined that infection with SARS-CoV downregulates the expression of ACE2. These low ACE2 concentrations were associated with lung oedema and acute lung injury, which contributed to the severe lung pathology in patients already on ACE inhibitors at the time of SARS-CoV infection. They concluded that modulating RAS may therefore be useful in treating infection.<sup><a href="#bibr46-0004563220928361">46</a></sup></p> <p>Some studies also questioned the use of anti-ACE2 antibodies to inhibit viral replication of SARS-CoV.

Increasing ACE2</div> <p>Trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant human ACE2 and the ARB losartan in COVID-19-infected patients. Infusion of recombinant human ACE2 may act as a decoy to interfere with viral replication. Soluble ACE2 could potentially bind SARS-CoV and thereby prevent the binding of the viral spike protein to full length membrane-bound ACE2<sup><a href="#bibr36-0004563220928361">36</a></sup> reducing viral infection of cells.<sup><a href="#bibr36-0004563220928361">36</a></sup> Recombinant ACE2 was shown to reverse lung injury in SARS-CoV-infected patients.<sup><a href="#bibr55-0004563220928361">55</a></sup> Wang etÂ al. found that ACE inhibitors and ARB offer partial cardiovascular protection by increasing ACE2, and that IV recombinant ACE2 may be beneficial in preventing pulmonary arterial hypertension and acute lung injury.<sup><a href="#bibr41-0004563220928361">41</a></sup></p> <p>However, circulating ACE2 concentrations are usually very low to undetectable and do not accurately represent the amount of membrane-bound ACE2 and would not be sufficient to sequester SARS-CoV-2 in the circulation.<sup><a href="#bibr26-0004563220928361">26</a></sup> A proposed clinical trial with recombinant ACE2 was withdrawn due to the unknown effects and the possibility of the drug inducing significant hypotension.<sup><a href="#bibr26-0004563220928361">26</a></sup></p> <p>ACE2 interaction with SARS-CoV is important in the development of SARS-associated cardiomyopathy, as viral RNA was found in the myocardium on postmortem examination. The associated cardiac injury due to reduced expression of ACE2 possibly played a major role in the morbidity and mortality of patients infected with SARS-CoV. Recombinant ACE2 was found to normalize angiotensin II concentrations, suggesting that it may be beneficial to prevent organ damage caused by SARS-CoV. The question thus arose if it is possible and beneficial to balance RAS control to reduce infection and prevent organ damage in COVID-19-infected patients.<sup><a href="#bibr33-0004563220928361">33</a></sup></p> </div> <div class="targetingtmprss2" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Angiotensin II</div> <p>Many patients with severe COVID-19 infection admitted to ICU are in septic shock. As most angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion by ACE occurs in the lungs, significant lung injury may decrease this. Decreased ACE function was found to be a predictor of mortality. Angiotensin II, a novel vasopressor agent, may be beneficial in this patient population.</p> <p>Strategies to decrease ACE2 may possibly attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This may happen in a number of ways. Firstly, endogenous angiotensin II theoretically prevents infection by binding the ACE2 during its degradation and therefore may compete with SARS-CoV-2 to bind to the receptor. Secondly, binding of angiotensin II to AT1 causes internalization and downregulation of ACE2. And lastly, angiotensin II causes AT1-dependent destruction of ACE2 further decreasing the virusâ€™ ability to enter cells. Angiotensin II is not yet available for use commercially, but due to the number of critically ill patients, and the promising outcome of the drug, it has been made available for compassionate use in Italy, Germany and UK.<sup><a href="#bibr61-0004563220928361">61</a></sup></p> </div> <div class="angiotensin(1â€" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Angiotensin (1â€"7)</div> <p>Another focus area is the use of angiotensin (1â€"7) as a novel treatment for COVID-19.<sup><a href="#bibr26-0004563220928361">26</a></sup> Experimental studies found that angiotensin (1â€"7) reduced the acute inflammatory response and subsequent fibrosis in acid-induced ARDS in mice.<sup><a href="#bibr62-0004563220928361">62</a></sup> Angiotensin (1â€"7) protected the lung against inflammation and fibrosis, inhibited alveolar cell apoptosis, attenuated endothelial cell activation, loss of barrier function and oedema, and decreased synthesis of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines.

Conclusion</div> <p>The effects of ACE2 on COVID-19 infections need to be further evaluated and randomized control trials are necessary to obtain the highest level of evidence. Although ACE2 has beneficial effects by regulating the protective arm of RAS, some authors postulate that high levels make patients more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. The RAS has numerous attractive therapy targets for COVID19 infection. Trials are needed to evaluate the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBâ€™s in COVID-19 patients.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
