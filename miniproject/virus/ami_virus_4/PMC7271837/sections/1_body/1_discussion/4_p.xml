 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Candidates that comply with the CCP donor selection criteria were sorted from the electronic health management system of the Turkish Ministry of Health, which was updated for additional questionnaire data for CCP donation. All recovered patients who were considered to meet the criteria for donation were selected and reached via phone at the end of the clinical recovery period, which has been indicated in the guidelines, to ask if they were willing to donate convalescent plasma. The list of the identified eligible volunteer candidates to donate plasma was shared with Turkish Red Crescent to be contacted for donation. An appointment was scheduled for the candidates who were eager to donate plasma. In addition, via social media and websites, to raise wider patients in those recovered from COVID-19 infection were encouraged to donate convalescent plasma. The main goal was to raise wider awareness to reach all donor candidates that are eligible for the convalescent plasma donation.
