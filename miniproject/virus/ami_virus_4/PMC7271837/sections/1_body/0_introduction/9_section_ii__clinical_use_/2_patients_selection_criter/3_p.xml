<p id="par0145">Duan et al. documented clinical success with the application of CCP to 10 severe COVID-19 patients in 16.5 days (median, range: 11–20 days) after the symptoms started. All patients had extensive pulmonary infiltrations and the severity criteria were defined with respiratory distress as; respiratory rate ≥30 /min, oxygen saturation &lt; 93 % in resting state, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). When compared to ten COVID-19 patients who did not receive CCP in the same center, CCP-group had significantly higher rates of survival and recovery with no appreciable adverse effect [
