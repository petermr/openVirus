past 20 years, with a large number of reports on the topic of
&#x02018;ultrasensitive&#x02019;, &#x02018;cost-effective&#x02019;, and &#x02018;early
detection&#x02019; tools with a potential of &#x02018;mass-production&#x02019; cited on the
web of science. Yet none of these tools are commercially available in the market or
practically viable for mass production and use in pandemic diseases such as coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this context, we review the technological challenges and
opportunities of current bio/chemical sensors and analytical tools by critically
analyzing the bottlenecks which have hindered the implementation of advanced sensing
technologies in pandemic diseases. We also describe in brief COVID-19 by comparing it
with other pandemic strains such as that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) for the identification of features that enable
biosensing. Moreover, we discuss visualization and characterization tools that can
potentially be used not only for sensing applications but also to assist in speeding up
the drug discovery and vaccine development process. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging
monitoring mechanism, namely wastewater-based epidemiology, for early warning of the
outbreak, focusing on sensors for rapid and on-site analysis of SARS-CoV2 in sewage. To
conclude, we provide holistic insights into challenges associated with the quick
translation of sensing technologies, policies, ethical issues, technology adoption, and
an overall outlook of the role of the sensing technologies in pandemics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nanosensors</kwd><kwd>nanoplasmonics</kwd><kwd>sewage sensors</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>atomic force microscopy</kwd><kwd>X-ray diffraction</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>point-of-care-technologies</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>pandemics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>nn0c04421</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>nn0c04421</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="sec1">In the last 15 years, humans have witnessed 5 pandemic diseases, severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), Swine flu, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), where both MERS and COVID-19 are actively present within our
community, with the latter having more severe complications and infection rates in recent
times. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) virus, which was actively revealed in Wuhan, China in December
2019 and later sequenced in January 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> In just a period of 2 months (March 2020), the disease had
spread to 90% of the countries on our planet. In parallel, there remains a great interest in
the biosensors and nanoscale visualization/characterization tools such as the electron
microscopy (EM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the early
detection and revealing prognostic features of a given pathogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Recent advances have also extended the
use of these advanced sensing techniques into the development of high-throughput devices
capable of screening a large number of candidate compounds for quick drug discovery and
vaccine development during pandemics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Most of the
latest sensors currently available in both academia and industry are based on the electrical
or optical transduction methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> These include single-molecule
sensors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> wearable devices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> ingestible
capsules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> disposable screen-printed electrodes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup>
and hand-held portable instruments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> which could actively detect the
infectious disease-causing pathogen at an early stage of the infection. Nevertheless,
despite their vast availability and well-known advantages in academia, the full potential of
the biosensing and characterization tools is yet to be harnessed in on-site applications,
such as during the outbreak of an infectious disease. Certainly, there are scientific
challenges and opportunities for bio/chemical sensors before they can live up to the
expectation of accurate, precise, and early diagnosis of emerging diseases. It is in this
context that we present an analysis of the state of art instruments and technologies, in
particular concerning COVID-19, for the detection and analysis of pandemic strains. In
general, we can segregate the detection of viruses into three main categories: (1) direct
detection of the virus, (2) viral RNA/DNA detection, and (3) antibody detection.</p><p>These sensing strategies are further complemented by the aforementioned surface
visualization/characterization tools (AFM, EM, XRD) presenting a complete package of
technologies that can potentially be used for diagnosis, prognosis, drug discovery, drug
analysis, and disease spread surveillance, all of which are vital for ensuring good
community health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> A
general overview of these groups including their mechanisms is discussed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>. It is also obvious that for quick technology
development, such as for the development of biosensors for COVID-19, it is essential to
build on the existing scientific evidence for the use of technology in similar applications.
Therefore, we begin by highlighting similarities and differences between other RNA viral
infections from the perspective of understanding the COVID-19 disease and subsequent
technology development to serve the required demand for sensing and characterization of the
SARS-CoV2 virus.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Categorization of Biosensing Strategies and Surface Characterization Techniques for

droplets and touch-based human to human contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Common symptoms of
this disease are similar to influenza, and therefore, it is not trivial to rapidly detect
the disease accurately. Comparative analysis of the SARS-CoV2 with other epidemic viral
strains serves as background information on which researchers can build upon to create
potential technologies to quickly address the demands of disease control in an
emergency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> While there are several similarities and differences
between these viruses, here we focus only on those features which will help researchers
working in the field of biosensors and surface visualization/characterization to develop
strategies for accurate detection and morphological analysis of SARS-CoV2. One striking
similarity between SARS-CoV2 virus and influenza, H1NI, SARS-CoV, and MERS viruses is that
all contain RNA as their genetic material, therefore also known as RNA viruses. Compared to
DNA viruses, RNA viruses are technically more virulent as they infect cells by injecting RNA
which quickly transcribes and replicates viral proteins in the host cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> This also makes it extremely challenging to detect a RNA virus at an early stage of the
infection. Cell culture and nucleic acid-based tests have been the gold standard since their
inception as compared to all other techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup></p><p>However, unlike the DNA viruses which have polymerase machinery, the nucleic acid tests for
RNA viruses include additional steps of reverse translation of RNA to DNA before it is
amplified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Structurally, as viruses responsible for COVID-19, SARS,
and MERS outbreaks belong to the same category of beta coronavirus family, these viruses are
mostly spherical, but sometimes pleomorphic in shape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> The average diameter of these viruses is 125 nm,
where their capsid covering the genetic material is around 85 nm and glycoprotein spikes on
the surface of the capsid are roughly 20 nm;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> see more out of scale
structural features of SARS-CoV2 virus in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>.
Comparing genetic characteristics of the SARS-CoV2 virus with other viruses may also provide
useful insights to develop sensing strategies for the early detection of COVID-19. For
example, untranslated regions (UTR) of the RNA, both at 5 prime and 3 prime ends are
involved in the binding of the cellular proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> The detailed
arrangement of coding regions of coronaviruses is given in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>. In addition, the mechanism of how coronaviruses infect cells can
also be useful for developing sensors for analyzing the disease mechanism and drug
discovery. In brief, the SARS-CoV2 virus enters a given cell <italic>via</italic>
protein&#x02013;protein interactions where the glycoprotein spikes bind to the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> This
attachment of the virus on the cell and further entry into the cell is assisted by protease
enzyme called TMPRSS2. After the entry of the SARS-CoV2 virus into the cells, the RNA
quickly translates into proteins, including the RNA synthesis in the cytoplasm by viral
replication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structural view of SARS-CoV2 virus and its surface protein. Reproduced with permission

techniques which include RT-PCR, chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scans, and the
detection of some common biomarkers in the blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> These biomarker tests
include identification of elevated levels of the C-reactive protein, low procalcitonin, low
lymphocyte counts, and high concentration of interleukin 6 and interleukin 10. Details of
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), CT scans, biochemical assays, and
the development of mobile phone-based digital contact tracing applications are discussed in
the proceeding subsections.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Molecular Method</title><p>Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a method used
to detect the presence of nucleic acid-based genetic sequences from any organism,
including viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup>
To perform RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV2, first the biological fluid where the virus strains are
present, upper and lower respiratory fluid, is collected. The collection of fluid is
generally performed using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup>
Then the collected fluid undergoes a number of filtration and separation steps to isolate
the viral RNA. Using the reverse transcriptase enzyme, complementary viral DNA (cDNA) is
generated from the viral RNA. Specific regions of cDNA then undergo a polymerase chain
reaction for amplification, where an additional DNA probe, designed to hybridize within a
small part of the specific region of cDNA, is incorporated to enable real-time detection
of the amplification process. Traditionally, radioactive isotopes were used as markers to
target the specific nucleic acids, but more recently, fluorescence tags (fluorophore and a
quencher) are used on the DNA probe for the real-time detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup>
Essentially when the DNA polymerase enzyme is adding nucleotides to the specific part of
the viral cDNA, it encounters the double-stranded DNA in its path (due to DNA probe) where
the exonuclease activity of the polymerase enzyme separates the fluorophore and the
quencher molecules to produce real-time detection of the viral cDNA. If the number of cDNA
copies (proportional to the concentration of the virus) produced after transcription is
high, a large amount of fluorescence signal is generated after few rounds of polymerase
reaction, and if the system is calibrated well, the fluorescence intensity is directly
proportional to the concentration of virus in the infected patients. The typical
sensitivity that can be achieved by RT-PCR is between 500 and 1000 copies/mL of viral RNA.
Among the current tests, three regions of the cDNA have been identified for the detection
of the SARS-CoV2 virus, which are the <italic>RdR</italic>P, <italic>E</italic>, and N
genes. More details about these sequences are described in Table 1 of the work from
Udugama <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> and on the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention website.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> One challenge that remains is also that
SARS-CoV2 damages the target RNA when opening its viral capsid. One reason might be due to
the immune response of the host body. This leads to a release of small fragments of RNA
into the bloodstream which is challenging for detection by RT-PCR. Perhaps, signal
enrichment strategies for isolation of RNA fragments using advanced technologies such as
CRISPR or in combination with nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles and
metal&#x02013;organic complexes may provide a solution to this problem. Another reason for
poor sensitivity using RT-PCR is that the RNA easily gets degraded and typically requires
an immediate frozen storage condition, and the completion of handling samples may also
induce the poor detection. However, the point-of-use sensors, discussed later, may provide
an immediate testing of RNA and will overcome this issue from the samples.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Computer Tomography</title><p>Computer tomography, which is more popular with the name of CT scan, is being used either
in combination or as a standalone diagnostic tool to confirm the false hits from RT-PCR
for the detection of SARS-CoV2 virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> In this
method, usually a large number of X-ray measurements of the chest are taken from different
angles to generate three-dimensional (3D) images with contrast, which are later analyzed
by radiologists for abnormal features to authenticate the presence of SARS-CoV2 infection.
Signatures of COVID-19 infection which appear in CT scan include areas of subpleural
regions of ground glass opacification affecting the lower parts of either a single lobe or
both lobes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> In addition, data from COVID-19 patients have shown
consolidation of fluids in the lungs. Moreover, the CT images have so far also assisted in
serving as a prognostic tool for COVID-19. For example, in the early days (0&#x02013;2
days) of the infection, the CT scan resembles more of a normal chest condition. As the
disease progresses, the opacity of the scan increases, for instance, patients after 4 days
of the infection have been reported with ground glass opacity which even appears as
irregular patterns in the scan. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>) shows a CT scan image from different patients on different days where the
various abnormalities are clearly visible such as focal ground glass opacity and include
bilateral and peripheral predominant consolidation after 20 days of the onset of the
disease. While CT scans are likely to remain as one of the most important tools in the
early diagnosis of the COVID-19, the major challenge for the radiologists lies in the
distinction of symptoms from other lung disorders or pneumonia-like symptoms which are not
due to COVID-19 infections. In fact, the main caveat of using CT scans for COVID-19 is
that the specificity of the detection is around 25%, as reported in the literature so
far,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> as the
imaging features overlap with other viral pneumonia. In addition, CT scans are expensive
and require advanced technical skills for the operation and analysis, and it can only be
adapted as a complementary technology with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2 detection.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Transverse thin-section CT scans in patients with COVID-19 disease: (A) 56 year-old

used to detect the viral protein or the antibodies that are created by our body in
response to a SARS-CoV2 infection for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. The standard
procedure to detect these antibodies involves the use of microtiter plates such as the
96-well, where antibodies are detected <italic>via</italic> protein&#x02013;protein
interactions. These interactions are amplified using a fluorescence, luminescence, or
colorimetric type of detection assisted by enzymes involved in the reaction. However, one
main issue is that as the amount of viral load changes during the course of the infection,
so detecting low concentrations of viral protein might be difficult. For instance, To
<italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> showed salivary viral loads in the first
week after the onset of symptoms, which gradually decreased with time. On the other hand,
detecting antibodies generated in response to the viral infection is more specific for
confirming presence of the COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, there are still potential
challenges with developing accurate serological tests such as those related with the
cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV2 antibodies with other antibodies generated against
coronaviruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> There are still some important advantages of the
antibody testing, for instance, the presence of antibodies can verify if vaccines are
functioning as intended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> It can also be used in disease contact
tracing applications, weeks after an individual is infected with the virus. Perhaps
currently it is the most important test to help inform the intervention policymakers on
how many asymptomatic cases exist in a given population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> However,
false negative results from the current antibody tests are often reported which are
attributed to the combination of following technical reasons: (1) a low concentration of
antibodies typically present in fluidic samples; (2) presence of homologous proteins; and
(3) lack of sensitivity from the detection instrument. While, low concentration of
antibodies and the presence of homologous proteins will remain challenging for the
biosensing community, the sensitivity of the current tools could perhaps be enhanced by
development of an engineered protein which will attach specifically to the antibody of
interest. However, the ultimate solution is the development of ultrasensitive and
selective biosensors, which we discuss more in the proceeding sections.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>Contact Tracing</title><p>Use of digital technologies, especially smartphone-based applications to identify the
presence of infected cases, both active and recovered, has also been implemented
successfully to manage the spread of COVID-19.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> Ferrite <italic>et

see more in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>. In this application, the
main idea is to replace a manual contact tracing with instantaneous transmission of
signals to and from a central server. Essentially, the SARS-CoV2 virus cases are directly
communicated to the server, which enables recommendation of risk-stratified quarantine and
social distancing measures in those now known to be possible contacts. This is done by
preserving absolute anonymity of the infected person. In addition, tests can also be
requested by symptomatic individuals through the developed application. One of the pros of
such software-based technology is that it can easily be tuned to be more informative, for
example, quarantining areas if the disease spread in that area becomes uncontrolled,
quarantining specific flats or families, or performing second or third degree contact
tracing if number of cases rise. Another advantage of contact tracing is the accessibility
of technology with members of the community. In the past few years there has been a steady
rise in the adoption of smartphones and mobile internet which could potentially facilitate
a coordinated response during pandemics. One main limitation of contact tracing is that to
harness the full potential of the technology, it is also necessary to increase the number
of diagnostic tests. Another limitation such as privacy consideration also exists, which
with changing time and circumstances are becoming more acceptable within the community
members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> The use of contact tracing however is still useful for
members of a community to track the movement of people who came in contact with the
infected, including the asymptomatic ones.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Contact tracing application: Using GPS contacts of individual A and all individuals

plays a role in the virus structure but also is involved in the mechanism of the
replication cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> The smallest and most enigmatic major proteins of
CoV viruses is the E protein. During the replication cycle, although a small portion of E
protein is incorporated into the virion envelope, it is abundantly expressed inside the
infected cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> The primary function of the N protein is to bind to
the CoV RNA genome and to form the structure of the nucleocapsid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> In
addition, of its major role in processes of viral genome, it involves the CoV replication
cycle and also the host cellular response to viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> The
shape of the viral envelop is defined by the M protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> The other
function of M protein is its role as the central organizer in CoV assembly through
interactions with other major structural proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> Coronavirus enters
into host cells by the attachment of transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein to the host
surface receptor. Also, the S protein mediates the subsequent fusion between the viral and
host cell membranes to make the entry of viral cell easier into the host
cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> The S
protein binds to ACE2, a transmembrane receptor which is widely expressed in the lungs,
kidneys, gastrointestinal tissue, and heart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> The binding to the host
cell receptor and fusion between viral and cellular membranes have been performed with two
subunits of the S protein: S1 subunit and S2 subunit, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup>
The S2 subunit contains neutralizing epitopes of the virus, including a conserved fusion
peptide, a transmembrane domain, a cytoplasmic domain, and heptad repeats 1 and 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup> In the S1 subunit, the core receptor binding domains are highly conserved.

COVID-19 detection from patients all around the globe. While many of these biomarkers are
not as specific as detecting the viral RNA or DNA directly from the blood or by using
RT-PCR, their concentration in the blood is found to be useful for the prognostics of the
COVID-19 disease. This is due to the fact that many protein-based molecules in the blood,
which eventually serve as the biomarkers of a disease, increase or decrease their levels
in order to fight against the infection. Therefore, some of these biomarkers are directly
linked to the severity of the infection. Particularly, serum urea, (CREA), C (CysC) serum
direct bilirubin (DBIL), (CHE), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations were found
to be significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patients than those in mild COVID-19
patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref></sup> More recently, smell

xenobiotics and support epithelial integrity required for smell function. Therefore,
developing biosensors for the detection of mucous proteins may also be useful for the
early detection of the SARS-CoV2 infection. However, it should be noted that these
biomarkers may not be specific to COVID-19 as nasal dysfunction is reported in other
diseases such as the Parkinson&#x02019;s disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup> More qualitative

ability to exclusively detect the analyte in the presence of other homologous analytes

have a nucleic acid genome, a protein capsid which covers the genome, and in some
cases lipid covering the genome and a protein coat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">76</xref></sup> This protein

Now this is most often a subject of research where it usually takes a dedicated team
and a time frame of 6&#x02013;12 months to develop probes specific to the target. This
obviously is a bottleneck for quick development of a biosensor during pandemics such
as the COVID-19. However, the advancements in nanotechnology and the pace with which
discovery and invention of materials are developing present a good opportunity for
researchers to develop chemical probes, specific only for the target under
detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref></sup>
While developing specific probes is obviously a challenge, recent work has
demonstrated an antifouling coating for the electrodes consisting of biomolecules
mixed in a network of conductive nanomaterials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">85</xref></sup> These layers were
found to preserve 88% of the original detection signals for IL-6 even after 1 month of
exposure to unprocessed human plasma.</p></list-item><list-item><p>High sensitivity:
The spacing, affinity, and specificity of the target probes in the monolayer, often
called self-assembled monolayers (SAM) or biorecognition elements, determine the
attachment of the analyte on the sensor surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref87">87</xref></sup> In addition, properties of the transducer
(most often electrical or optical) influence the overall sensitivity of the

before a response from the sensor could easily be distinguished from its inherent
noise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">89</xref></sup> If specificity of the SAM layer is ensured, then it is

molecular level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">91</xref></sup> For the detection of biomarkers associated with pandemic strains
such as the COVID-19, it is of the utmost importance that the developed sensor can
detect the disease-specific biomarkers at a low concentration, preferably at a single
molecule level, and produce an output which is easily readable for the
measured/required concentration. For instance, one major challenge, if addressed, to
detect the viral DNA or RNA directly in whole blood without the need of amplification

of the pandemic viral strains. Some complementary tools such as the nanoparticle-based

time: For a diagnosis tool to be actively used in a pandemic, the response time of the

transducers in the sensor respond instantaneously (&#x0003c;1 s) to the applied stimulus,
such as upon the interaction of biomolecule with the sensor surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref98">98</xref></sup> However, at times, many of these signals require post-processing with
advanced electronics and computing systems for accurate analysis of the measured
quantity. For instance, temperature correction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">99</xref></sup> and background
noise identification and removal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">100</xref></sup> can often lead to an increase

when there is less understanding of the characteristics of the viral strain, it is
often the concentrations of common blood biomarkers (such as CRP and interlukien as
described for COVID-19) which serve as the signature of the infection. As also
described earlier that for COVID-19 detection, a combination of more than two
biomarkers is currently used to confirm the disease; therefore, a multiplexed system
which allows detection of multiple biomarkers is desirable for a quick, accurate, and
early detection of the disease. Multiplexing can be achieved by physically isolating
different areas of the sensor surface, where each isolated area acts as a standalone
sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102">102</xref></sup>
Each of these individual areas could further be made specific to one type of

validation: For the detection of a pandemic strain, it is also necessary that the
sensor, while providing a quick response, is also reliable. To increase the
reliability in the measurement of the sensor, more than one mode of sensing could
provide cross validation of the sensing result.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref107">107</xref></sup> The major
trade-off of the multimode sensing is an increase in the size of physical dimensions
and computation time of the sensor. This can also lead to a slow response time,
increased power consumption, and cost ineffectiveness. However, the good news is that
most of these barriers are rapidly being addressed. Electrochemical and optical
techniques on single platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref></sup> which can easily be translated
into multiplexed panels are increasingly getting attention in both academia and
industry, which might be able to serve the purpose of increased reliability and
robustness required in the healthcare sensors, by instant authentication of the
measured data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Disposable: The fact that the pandemic
viral strains are highly infectious, for example, COVID-19 has a reproductive number
higher than that established for SARS and H1N1, that is, between 1.5 and 2, the need
for single-use sensors is crucial for avoiding contamination from the sensing systems.
The most judicial pathway to develop a disposable sensor system is the modular
approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109">109</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref></sup> In this approach,
electrode and readout modules can be separately designed where electrodes can be made
cost-effective and disposable in nature. Candidate materials for developing disposable
electrodes could potentially include glass-,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">112</xref></sup>

community in recent times, provide the most optimal disposable features, as such
electrodes could be classified into burnable trash after use. On the other hand,
readout modules in the form of a mobile phone application-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref120">120</xref></sup>
readout will provide many advantages other than cost-effectiveness, such as periodic
data collection and connectivity to the centralized healthcare
systems.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Long shelf life and easy to use: The electrodes
developed should be easy to use, and their lifetime should be at least 1 month. This

of a biosensor is effectively reflected in its affordability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref123">123</xref></sup>
Intuitively, the lower the price of a given biosensor, the more affordable is the
device. To keep the price low, so that all members of the community can afford it
during pandemics, a biosensing system can essentially be divided into two parts: The
first part can be a disposable electrode such as the screen printed electrode or a
paper-based electrode, which could potentially be available in the supermarket drug
shelves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref124">124</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref125">125</xref></sup>
The electrode could have direct contact with a body fluid such as saliva for the quick
detection of viral strain. The second part of the sensor system can be an application
on a mobile phone which can essentially serve the purpose of a direct readout of
signals from the sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref126">126</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref127">127</xref></sup> Such applications could potentially be made available by the
government or healthcare government body of the affected region or community. On the
other hand, a standalone readout and data acquisition system with data loggers for
disposable sensors can also be developed, which could be equipped in hospitals or at
border control posts of a country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref128">128</xref></sup> Certainly there are some
biosensors that are now easily available in the supermarkets such as the pregnancy
test strips and lateral flow strips for sexually transmitted disorders and for glucose
meters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref125">125</xref></sup> It is on similar lines that sensors which can rapidly
detect viral infection, if developed, could turn out to very useful for self-testing
of infectious diseases. In addition, this would decrease the load on the public health
bodies to detect the disease in a large-sized population, which could also lead to
timely control of the disease spread.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mass manufacturing:
During pandemics, there is an urgent and large demand for sensors that can detect the
fast spreading disease accurately and quickly. Due to lack of availability and
reachability of a number of sensors, low rates of testing compared to total population

Repurposing some of the instrumentation such as the 96-well microtiter plate readers could
also potentially provide multiple replicates of a bioassay in a short duration of time. Such
absorbance readers are so common that nearly all laboratories which provide routine blood

developed already exists within many test facilities. Another important aspect which could
potentially lead to a quick solution required in mid-pandemics is the use of
soft-biosensing. For instance, artificially intelligent software could be installed in
hand-held thermometers which are currently being widely used in the screening of COVID-19
candidate patients. Software could perhaps be developed in such a way that the infrared
signals analyzed by the detector provide information on some key skin biomarkers, in

among the population before the initial cases were reported in many cities. Therefore, WBE
could be used as an early warning tool for the presence and prevalence of COVID-19
infections and provide a more accurate estimate of the spread extent of COVID-19 infections
than clinical testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref223">223</xref></sup> RT-PCR assays have been routinely employed for
SARS-CoV2 detection in numerous research and disease control centers since the outbreak of
COVID-19,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref223">223</xref></sup> as also discussed in our aforementioned sections. However,
RT-PCR has some disadvantages which may limit its applications globally. For example,
complete facilities, expensive equipment, skilled technicians, and laborious procedures are
essential for RT-PCR. With the rapid growth of COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide, this
method has been unable to meet the requirements of detecting numerous suspicious cases in a
short time even though in some cases, PCR has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity.
Essentially, the requirements for complicated sample handling in the laboratory, skilled
personnel, and a long period of data processing and analysis (4&#x02013;6 h) are not
conducive to real-time and effective monitoring of samples on location. Therefore, it is
critical to develop efficient transportable and robust analytical tools to accurately and
quickly trace low-level SARS-CoV2 sources through WBE to confirm these suspected cases and
screen asymptomatic infected cases without centralized laboratories. Using a WBE strategy in
creating an early warning and intervention system will require a rapid biosensing method for
the on-site detection of viruses at the wastewater collection outlets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref209">209</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref212">212</xref></sup> We have recently proposed the use
of a paper-based device which can be used for WBE, as developed in our previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref224">224</xref></sup> see <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref> for more details.
Recent advances on signal amplification strategies have also lead to enhanced sensitivity in
paper-based analytical devices for various sensing applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref225">225</xref></sup> Due
to the advantages of low cost, rapidness, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and
simplicity, biosensors have been applied in detecting different analytes for clinical
diagnosis, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Recently, biosensors have been
employed for electrochemical, optical, electrical, thermal, acoustic, and piezoelectric
determination of infectious diseases such as AIDS, dengue, Ebola, influenza, and malaria.
The biomarkers of these infectious diseases are usually identified in blood, feces, plasma,
serum, sputum, saliva, urine and nasal mucosa. When detecting wastewater samples, the matrix
effects of the wastewater can also be minimized using an ultrahigh-affinity probe for
specific targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref226">226</xref></sup> Moreover, biosensors can be extended for the
multiplex detection of infectious diseases. For instance, Men <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref227">227</xref></sup> presented a multifunctional fluorescent protein nanowire (FNw) for
multiplex detection of hemagglutinin 1 protein from the influenza virus along with p24 and
gp120 protein from HIV. The FNw integrated with numerous green fluorescent protein molecules
could amplify signal and enhance sensitivity. In addition, biosensors can be developed into
integrated medical devices for point-of-care detection of infectious diseases in
resource-limited regions. For example, Choi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref228">228</xref></sup>
presented an integrated paper-based sample-to-answer biosensor for nucleic acid testing. The
fast technology analysis (FTA) card and glass fiber were integrated into a lateral flow
strip for nucleic acid extraction, amplification, eye detection, and smartphone
quantification. A hand-held battery-powered heating device was also used for LAMP
amplification in POC settings. Hence, biosensors can be employed as early warning sensing
systems to help the government take effective measures in advance to prevent the spread of
infectious diseases.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Design of an integrated sensor for the detection of multiplex infectious disease

paper-based device which has shown great potential to detect pathogens in wastewater.
Essentially, we developed a fast &#x0201c;sample-to-answer&#x0201d; analysis method which can
provide quantitative monitoring of nucleic acids and genetic information through the
analysis of sewage waste.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref229">229</xref></sup> Our results were further cross validated
with a robust electrophoresis and agarose gel image assay, showing promising reliability for

rapid analysis time, excellent sensitivity, superior specificity, and low reagent/sample
consumption. These benefits highlight the biosensors&#x02019; extraordinary capability of
economical, portable, and user-friendly detection of SARS-CoV2 in wastewater compared to
traditional detection methods. Biosensors will help identify COVID-19 infected patients on
the spot to provide timely medical advice and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV2 at early
stage. Therefore, sewage sensors for SARS-CoV2 detection at the population level have a
clear potential for early warning of COVID-19 pandemic. For example, a recent study
demonstrated that live SARS-CoV2 was isolated from the feces and urine of infected people,
which would then enter the wastewater treatment system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref230">230</xref></sup> Although
SARS-COV-2 is usually present in sewage in the form of RNA particles, there currently is no
evidence which shows live SARS-CoV-2 present in sewage. Within this viewpoint, further
research on the environment for the analysis of disease biomarkers is required to
effectively use WBE biosensors for an informed status of the disease within a community.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Nanoscale Visualization and Characterization Tools</title><p>There are three principal techniques commonly used individually or in combination for the
direct visualization, diagnosis, and characterization of virus structure: XRD analysis, EM,
and AFM. The exceptional capabilities of these instruments allow not only in-depth analysis
of virus structure and function but also investigation of viral impact on host cells and
extracellular environment, useful in drug discovery applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref231">231</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref241">241</xref></sup></p><sec id="sec9.1"><title>Electron Microscopy</title><p>An EM is a tool that uses a beam of accelerated electrons as a source of illumination.
Due to the short wavelength of electrons in comparison with visible light photons (up to
100,000 times), the resolving power of EM is higher than optical microscopes and can
visualize the structure of particles at nanometer scales. The capability of EM to reveal
the structures of nanoparticles makes it a powerful instrument for detection, diagnosis,
and analysis of viruses (as viruses are of the same scale as that of many inorganic
nanoparticles such as gold, extensively used in research). In comparison, with the
molecular and serological approaches used for virus diagnosis which require specific probe
to recognize virus, EM methods do not need organism-specific reagents for recognizing the
pathogenic agent. It means for the case of an unknown disease, molecular tests need
information about the potential agents to determine the appropriate tests, while EM
provides an open view of whatever might be present in a given sample under
investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref237">237</xref></sup> Besides the capability of EM in direct detection of
virus by visualization, it provides information about the ultrastructure of the virus, its
structural dynamics related to the attachment, and replication processes. This makes EM a
useful tool in the discovery and design of antiviral agents and
vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref236">236</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref238">238</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref242">242</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref243">243</xref></sup> The main techniques of EM microscopy to analyze the
virus structures are negative staining, thin sectioning, immune electron microscopy (IEM),
cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), tomography, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In
negative staining, the background is stained, leaving the actual specimen untouched and
thus visible. Thin sectioning is used to reduce the viruses into thin layers to be
transparent for electrons. The principle of IEM is the formation of immune complexes of
the virus with its associated antibody. The cryo-EM is an imaging procedure used to
generate high-resolution 3D images of samples, commonly biological materials and cells. In
this method, a series of two-dimensional (2D) images of sample are captured while it is
tilted at different angles, and then, the 2D images are merged to reconstruct 3D
image.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref243">243</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref245">245</xref></sup> On the other hand, SEM
has also been used for virus quantification procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref246">246</xref></sup> It should be

characterization of the SARS agent and development of antiviral strategies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref253">253</xref></sup> and we envisage that such techniques can easily be extended to reveal the
details of CoV 19 viruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec9.2"><title>X-ray Crystallography</title><p>The XRD from single crystals is a promising method to obtain the highest resolution of
the virus structure and visualize the macromolecular assemblies at an atomic level.
Generally, there are five steps to identify the virus structure using X-ray
crystallography techniques which include: preparation and purification of virus particles,
crystallization and mounting the particle crystal, measurement of diffracted data,
calculation of phase through molecular replacement (MR) or isomorphous
replacement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref254">254</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref255">255</xref></sup>
and finally, map interpretation and building the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref256">256</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref258">258</xref></sup></p><p>To prepare and purify the viruses from the extracellular/tissue culture media,
purification kits are readily accessible from the commercial sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref259">259</xref></sup> During the preparation steps, to maintain the icosahedral symmetry of the virus, the
handling procedures should be performed as gentle as possible. Following the purification
stage, crystallization is required to bring the aqueous protein solution to
supersaturation. There are two phases in crystallization: nucleation and growth. In
nucleation, the crystal nucleus is formed at the critical size of molecular aggregation,
then a subsequent process of growth is initiated. For growing the crystals of virus
samples, there are four methods, batch crystallization, dialysis, liquid&#x02013;liquid
diffusion, and vapor diffusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref260">260</xref></sup></p><p>To improve the resolution and prevent the secondary radiation damage to the virus sample
in the collection process of X-ray data, the crystallographic data are collected at
cryogenic temperature, typically around 100 K. Growing high-quality virus crystal is one
of the challenges in X-ray crystallography of the virus particles. Methods currently in
use are time-consuming and based on trial and error procedures. Nevertheless, cryo-EM/ET
can be a powerful complementary method for virus protein crystallography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref261">261</xref></sup> Information provided by 3D cryo-EM can be integrated with the collected
X-ray data to improve the built model of virus particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref262">262</xref></sup></p><p>Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) is another type of X-ray crystallography that
uses X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). Due to the pulse duration in femtosecond and
unparalleled brilliance of XFEL beams, this technique is useful to study the viruses as
both a crystal and single particle. Using time-resolved SFX, the changes during life
cycles of viruses such as their response to the variation of pH and viral protein
interaction with the receptors can be detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref234">234</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref263">263</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref265">265</xref></sup> Therefore, the combination of high-resolution static
structure of viruses obtained by cryo-EM and dynamic results of conformational changes at
room temperature using SFX can be a breakthrough toward producing time-resolved virus
structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref266">266</xref></sup> The use of X-ray crystallography methods to study the
family of coronaviruses shows the ability of the tool for in-depth analysis of
COVID-19.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref267">267</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref269">269</xref></sup> Recently, in ref
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref270">270</xref>), the 3D crystal structure of the SARS-CoV2
unliganded Mpro at 1.75 &#x000c5; resolution is determined (see <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure
<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref></xref> for more details), and it was used to guide the
optimization of a series of &#x003b1;-ketoamide inhibitors. Such structural analysis forms a
strong basis for further development of these compounds to antiviral drugs. However, both
common EM and XRD methods are based on the averaging of the numerous particles present in
the electron micrographs or crystal. Therefore, there is a limitation in the information
obtained from these structural differences that can exist between the individual particles
in a large population. Besides, these methods require environments which are far away from
the physiological conditions in which the virus normally operates and precludes the
characterization of their dynamic properties in real time. This complicates structural
studies of viruses that lack a well-defined symmetry such as the SARS-CoV2 as an enveloped
virus. A third, direct imaging technology that provides significant impact on virus study
is AFM. AFM provides possibilities for studying the COVID-19 virus particles,
complementing classical EM and XRD studies.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p>The 3D structure of SARS-CoV2 Mpro, in two different views. One protomer of the

measurement, the deflection of microcantilever is used to probe the interaction between
the surface of the sample and the nanometric tip located at the end of microcantilever.
Based on the time scales, type, and range of interaction, an extensive range of
information including atomistic details of the surface, mechanical, physical, chemical,
thermal, and viscoelastic properties of nano/bio materials can be
obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref272">272</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref287">287</xref></sup> The earliest invented mode of AFM was the
contact mode, where the tip is raster scanned through the sample surface while maintaining
a constant force applied to the sample through deflection detection by adjusting the
height of the tip. The main challenges in using contact mode to image soft materials such
as viruses and other biological specimens is the applied force to avoid the reversible or
irreversible deformation, unwanted friction, and damage to the sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref288">288</xref></sup> To improve the image resolution and minimize the applied force and friction, the
dynamic AFM was invented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref289">289</xref></sup> Generally, in dynamic AFM, the
microcantilever is oscillated usually close to its resonance frequency while scanning the
sample surface.</p><p>Two major dynamic AFM modes are amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy (AM- AFM)
(also known as tapping mode) and frequency modulation atomic force microscopy
(FM-AFM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref289">289</xref></sup> In the dynamic mode, due to the decrease of the contact
time between tip and sample to the small fraction of oscillation period, the friction is
minimized and the risk of damage to the sample is significantly reduced. In addition, of
these two common modes of dynamic AFM, recently, several advanced techniques are developed
to increase the resolution and explore more information from the materials during imaging.
Due to the dynamic nature of these advanced techniques, they can be classified as
multifrequency methods,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref281">281</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref289">289</xref></sup> where the cantilever is excited at different frequencies and different

developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref297">297</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref298">298</xref></sup>
In this method, the tips are functionalized by specific ligands. Then, based on the
adhesion and mechanical strength of bonds formed between functionalized tip and receptors
of the samples, the biological properties can be explored during
imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref291">291</xref></sup> The
main challenge of FD-based AFM is the high volume and time of data acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> To increase the speed of imaging and reduce the amount of collected data

remains in overcoming the difficulties associated with translating the laboratory research
quickly into commercially viable prototypes by industry and addressing the complex
regulatory issues required for clinical settings, especially during pandemics. The good news
is that slowly the technology transfer investments from government and industry is on the
rise. In addition, regulatory policies from the government in many countries are becoming
increasingly business friendly with the academics. This is evident from the fact that a lot
of organizations are now identifying and bridging gaps between the academic research and
industrial needs <italic>via</italic> workshops and university-funded proof-of-concept
projects. Moreover, specialized urgent funds without limits are set up by many governments
during an infectious disease outbreak such as for the COVID-19. On the other hand,
instrumentation such as SPR, AFM, XRD, and EM, while well-established and developed from the
infrastructure viewpoint, has a high cost which limits its use mostly to laboratory
testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref308">308</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref309">309</xref></sup>
Still, large-scale industries, especially the ones involved in the vaccine development and
testing, can potentially reveal morphological features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref310">310</xref></sup></p><p>However, one significant challenge in the technology transfer of most of the biosensors and
advanced instrumentation is the capacity building of human resources. The main reason is
that practical hands on skills from subjects which are fundamentally far from each other
such as biology and electronics are often required with the operator of the sensing
instrumentation. This limitation is also being addressed by many educational institutions
where courses and projects are encouraged to be interdisciplinary in nature. Other technical
challenges for fast technology transfer during pandemics which remain elusive are quick
adoption of the biosensor manufacturing protocols and reliability of the sensors. As most of
the quickly developed technologies are customized for the pandemic strains, reproducibility,
stability, and reliability tests can take more than a few months of time to generate
statistical data for making informed decisions. It is here that fundamental science and
engineering need to further discover materials which are inherently physically and
chemically stable and invent technologies to provide more reliability in the
measurements.</p><p>In addition, modular sensing systems also provide a flexibility in usage for different
analytical biomarkers. For instance, in a single measuring module, electrodes could
potentially be used for the detection of multiple biomarkers of a pandemic strain by simply
changing the biorecognition layer or the surface chemistry on the electrode. On the other
hand, translation of nanoscale analytical technologies to clinical settings depends on the
ability to simplify complex analytical devices for non-experts to use and control.
Automation and remote control of devices, which is fast increasing with the advent of the
internet of healthcare technology, might provide solutions whereby quick troubleshooting or
assistance in calibration can be provided to the medical staff (user) remotely and
easily.</p></sec><sec id="sec11"><title>Ethics and Technology Adoption</title><p>While the innovative sensing technologies have immense potential to revolutionize the
healthcare system during a crisis such as the COVID-19, there are important ethical issues
revolving around such technologies. Arguments concerning data confidentiality, ownership,
and privacy are extremely challenging to address in a short duration of time, leading to a
decrease in the adoption of the technology by community members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref311">311</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref312">312</xref></sup> Especially, the sensors which aim
to provide immediate, detailed, and objective feedback of the measurement remotely to the
information management systems must abide to the data protection legislatures of the given
region. Even though passing the quality controls related to the data protection has nowadays
become fast, the acceptability of these technologies in terms of their reliability remains
low. Many medical staff still have concerns whether the developed technology has enough
understanding of the biology to be properly informed from the measurement. Moreover, with
traditional medicine, before a doctor provides a treatment, they must seek a
patient&#x02019;s consent to reasonably inform them about the risks and benefits associated
with the intended treatment. In this context, the risks and benefits of the mobile heath
applications and self-use biosensors are not explicit as most often users are less willing
to read the terms and conditions which usually pop up while using an application. However,
toward the laboratory-based testing, biosensors and surface characterization tools eliminate
ethical issues such as those associated with animal and human testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref313">313</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref314">314</xref></sup> For example, if a drug is required
to be developed in a short duration during a pandemic, large-scale testing can potentially
be performed on high-throughput sensing platforms before it is considered viable to test on
animals and humans. Large-scale testing could include a variety of characterizations to
reveal molecular affinity, specificity, and cross reactivity with potential compounds inside
the organism. Therefore, with the increased use of modern characterization tools and
bio/chemical sensors, large uncertainties associated with quick drug development and testing
can potentially be eliminated.</p></sec><sec id="sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Biosensors and nanoscale visualization/characterization tools can be considered as
innovative and promising tools that can lead to life saving decisions on treatment and a
deep understanding of pandemic strains. As we have witnessed extreme challenges associated
with the testing and validation of viruses in COVID-19, we need to be prepared in terms of
diagnostics to prevent a spread of any new emerging infectious diseases. Recently, Narvaez
<italic>et al</italic>. suggested seven main recommendations for biosensing community,
including the funding agencies: (1) investment; (2) collaboration; (3) mass manufacturing;
(4) devices should comply with regulation bodies such as FDA; (5) rigorously satisfy
features such as disposability and low sample volume tests; (6) integrate with Internet Of
Things (IOT), and (7) ease of use for members of the community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref315">315</xref></sup> With
the rapid advancement of nanotechnology, we believe that the sensing mechanism will emerge
with a multidisciplinary approach, to enable rapid and on-site detection of viruses for
point-of-care diagnosis and prevent epidemics at an early stage.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement" id="NOTES-d7e2008-autogenerated"><p>The authors declare no competing financial interest.</p></notes><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>N.B. would like to thank support from Royal Society, grant number IEC\R3\193004 during the
