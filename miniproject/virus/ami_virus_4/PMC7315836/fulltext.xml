has emerged and raised global concerns due to its virulence. SARS-CoV-2 is the
etiological agent of &#x0201c;coronavirus disease 2019&#x0201d;, abbreviated to COVID-19,
which despite only being identified at the very end of 2019, has now been classified as
a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). At this time, no specific
prophylactic or postexposure therapy for COVID-19 are currently available. Viral entry
is the first step in the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle and is mediated by the trimeric spike
protein. Being the first stage in infection, entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is an
extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point. Within this review, we highlight
therapeutic intervention strategies for anti-SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other coronaviruses
and speculate upon future directions for SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor designs.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>jm0c00502</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>jm0c00502</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. They belong to the order
of <italic>Nidovirales</italic> and are classified into four genera: &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;,
&#x003b3;, and &#x003b4;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> Coronaviruses are animal viruses with circulating
reservoirs in mammals and birds. For most coronaviruses, the lifecycle can be dissected into
four steps, including viral entry, replication, assembly, and release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Until last year, six strains of coronaviruses have been identified that are pathogenic to
humans. Among them are CoV-NL63, CoV-OC43, CoV-HKU1, and CoV-229E that could cause mild
respiratory tract diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> However, two of the &#x003b2;-CoVs, the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused severe epidemics in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> In April 2003, SARS-CoV was responsible
for 8098 infections, with a fatality rate of &#x0223c;10% by the end of September
2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> MERS-CoV emerged from its zoonotic reservoir in 2012 and
infected 2494 people with a fatality rate of &#x0223c;34% by the end of 2019.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Both outbreaks having such high fatality rates, highlight the need for
surveillance of coronavirus emergence. While efforts for the development of antivirals
against SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV are still in process, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has
emerged from an epicenter located in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup>
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has quickly spread in and beyond China. As of May 28,
2020, there have been more than 5&#x0202f;596&#x0202f;550 diagnosed cases around the world,
with 353&#x0202f;373 confirmed deaths (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> The United States of America and Brazil reporting the

some SARS-CoV strains (GZ02, BJ01, Tor2, SZ3, PC4-227) and interestingly 96% identity to the
bat coronavirus BatcoV RaTG13.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> The receptor-binding spike (S) protein
is highly divergent from other CoVs and displays nucleotide sequence identities of 75% or
less to all other previously described SARS-CoVs. However, again, the new SARS-CoV-2 S
protein shares 93.1% identity to the RaTG13 S protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup></p><p>The glycoprotein or S protein is responsible for receptor recognition and viral entry into
host cells. The spike protein can be divided into two domains; S1 is responsible for
angiotensin-converting enzyme II(ACE2) recognition, the recently identified host cell
receptor, and S2 mediates membrane fusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Structural alignment of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with
SARS-CoV S protein shows that both S proteins are similarly with a root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 &#x000c5; over 959 C&#x003b1; atoms, while the S2 domain, responsible for
membrane fusion, display the most substantial similarities with an RMSD of 2.0 &#x000c5; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>C).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein in its prefusion conformation (PDB

entry steps can vary and are cell-type specific. SARS-CoV can enter the host cell via both
clathrin (endosomal) and nonclathrin pathways (nonendosomal); however, both pathways are
dependent upon ACE2 binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> The clathrin-mediated pathway includes the S protein binding to ACE2 and
subsequent dynamin/clathrin-mediated internalization of endosomal vesicles that maturate to
late endosomes. Within the late endosomes and lysosomes, acidification of the internalized
endosomes and H<sup>+</sup>-dependent activation of the cellular cathepsin L proteinase
takes place that cleaves and activates the S protein, therefore initiating viral fusion with
the endosomal/lysosomal membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>). In the
case of SARS-CoV, cell culture studies revealed that the entry process is delayed with a lag
phase of around 30 min, suggesting substantial maturation requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup>
In accordance with findings that mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and feline coronavirus
(FCV) infections of HeLa cells are also heavily dependent on endosomal maturation, the
clathrin-dependent entry and endosomal maturation are key to entry across
Coronaviridae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> For SARS-CoV-2, a recent study also confirms that
virus can use host cell receptor CD147 to gain entry into the host cells besides
ACE2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Entry model of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. Binding of the S1 domain within the spike
(S) protein to the cellular ACE2 receptor triggers conformational changes in the S2
domain that results in internalization and subsequent membrane fusion ((A)
endosomal/clathrin-dependent pathway). The endosomal pathway is facilitated by a low pH
and the pH-dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 can enter
the cell via the nonendosomal/clathrin-independent pathway (B). During this route, ACE2
recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (comparable to route A) is followed by
additional activation/cleavage of the S protein into S1 and S2 domains by cell
membrane-associated serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D. The figure was

in the nonendosomal entry of coronaviruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Host proteases such as the
transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and TMPRSS11D can cleave the S protein at the
S1/S2 cleavage site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>) to prime and
activate the S protein for membrane fusion during the nonendosomal pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> A recent study also confirms that TMPRSS2 expressing VeroE6 cells are highly
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the importance of TMPRSS2 in the
replication cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup></p><p>MERS-CoV can also be activated by furin (serine endoprotease) to initiate the nonclathrin
mediated membrane fusion event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Interestingly, in the new SARS-CoV-2 S
protein, additional amino acid insertions at the S1/S2 cleavage site results in an
&#x0201c;RRAR&#x0201d; furin recognition site absent in SARS-CoV S protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> This polybasic insertion sequence has possible implications for the SARS-CoV-2
replication cycle and its increased pathogenicity. Indeed, polybasic furin sites have been
observed in hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of highly virulent avian and human influenza
viruses, and similar furin-like processing events are also observed for other RNA viruses
such as Ebola virus and Marburg virus, human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and
flaviviruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup></p><p>To activate the S protein for membrane fusion with the cellular membrane, structural
rearrangements within the S2 domain are required. Two heptad repeats, HR1 (dark blue in
<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>) and HR2 can interact to form a
six-helix bundle (6-HB), a common postfusion structure shared by all type I viral
glycoproteins, to bring viral and cellular membranes in close proximity. Additionally, the
S2 domain contains a membrane interacting domain or fusion peptide that is exposed upon
specific triggers such as receptor binding or low endosomal pH. To date, three membrane
interacting regions with host-membrane destabilizing effects have been identified in the
SARS-CoV S protein: two conserved sequences across coronaviridae, with residues
798&#x02013;815<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> and residues 864&#x02013;886,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> both
C-terminal positioned at the second cleavage site in the S protein termed S2&#x02032; at Arg
797 and a less conserved third region with membrane disordering properties residues
770&#x02013;788.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> Once in the host cell, the viral particle uncoats and

polyproteins pp1a (4382 amino acids) and pp1ab (7073 amino acids) that are processed by
3-C-like protease (3Clpro) and papain-like protease (Plpro). The processing of these

SARS-CoV-2 shares 96% sequence identity at a whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus, and
importantly, they confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as
SARS-CoV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Recently, the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2
bound to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 was solved, providing an important structural foundation

the RdRp and the 3CLpro are highly conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> Therefore, it is widely accepted that SARS-CoV-2 would behave similarly to

binding to the RBD, suggesting that m396 inhibits SARS-CoV-ACE2 binding as the predominant
mechanism of action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref></sup> However, SARS-COV-2 showed some complexities for
RBD directed antibodies. For instance, Wrapp et al. tested cross-reactivity of three

IC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.8 and 0.1 &#x003bc;M, respectively. These recombinant

MERS-CoV pseudoparticles, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 460 and 180 pM,
respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> In addition, REGN3051 and REGN3048 showed a good
performance in a novel transgenic mouse model, which was developed by replacing the mouse
DPP4 coding sequence with that encoding human DPP4. Results suggested that both REGN3051
and REGN3048 were able to potently reduce MERS-CoV specific RNA levels in the lungs at a
200 &#x003bc;g per mouse dose compared with the isotype control antibody. At the 20 &#x003bc;g
dose, REGN3051 was more effective at decreasing MERS-CoV RNA levels compared with REGN3048
at the same dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> Recently, in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV

within the acidic milieu followed by membrane fusion activation by the host protease
cathepsin L. Membrane fusion is also essential during the nonendosomal/clathrin-independent

was declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. The number of infections continues to rise,
and numerous research groups around the globe have prioritized the identification and
development of new COVID-19 treatments. Still, there are no effective treatments to date.
Viral entry is the first step in the viral life cycle and represents an attractive
intervention point by blocking the coreceptor interaction or the virus&#x02013;cell membrane
fusion event. SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses have similar infection mechanisms. This is
especially true for SARS-CoV and CoV-NL63, which share the same human ACE2 receptor crucial
for viral entry. Therefore, already developed inhibitors against known hCoVs could
potentially be used to combat SARS-CoV-2. These efforts identified a large number of
inhibitors, including peptides, antibodies, small-molecule compounds, and natural products
with anticoronavirus activity. Although many inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting
coronavirus virus infection, no specific prophylactic or postexposure therapy is currently
available for HCoVs. One of the main reasons causing this is that most of the potenial
agents were not adequately evaluated for in vitro and in vivo studies. Most drugs are in the
preclinical stage and stopped in animal models due to poor bioavailability, safety, and
pharmacokinetics so that few entered human trials. In light of the urgency of the current
outbreak, repositioning of already approved drugs is increasingly becoming a promising
approach, especially with toxicity and safety data in hand.</p><p>The most effective measure to prevent viral diseases is vaccination. Coronavirus vaccine
development mainly focused on S protein, and some of them reported can inhibit
SARS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">134</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref136">136</xref></sup> and MERS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref137">137</xref></sup> Although vaccination strategies were developed in the context of previous
epidemics, no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infections is yet available. Since the recent
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, research groups around the world are now stepping up to develop
vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2, and vaccine research routes include nucleic acid vaccines,
viral vector vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and recombinant protein vaccines. Typical
vaccine development is time, resource, and financially consuming, although this pandemic has
created initiatives that hope to speed the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Even the
most optimiztic views regarding an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine being created are at least
one year away. Even after creation, other hurdles for the SARS-CoV-2 include global
implementation and distribution, and different strategies for containing this contagion
should be explored simultaneously as the vaccine efforts.</p><p>In addition to small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccine development,
convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-2 survivors (convalescent-phase sera) is an additional
option for COVID-19 treatment. Passive immunization was well established for viral infection
prophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref138">138</xref></sup> By meta-analysis of studies about the 1918 influenza,
H1N1 influenza epidemic demonstrated that early treatment of convalescent blood products
decreased the risk ratio caused by pneumonia from 37% to 16%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref139">139</xref></sup>
Nevertheless, the appropriate titer of the convalescent-phase sera antibody remains to be
determined, which was required for therapeutic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Research
carried out with MERS-CoV suggested that sera from patients recovering from infections did
not contain sufficient antibody titers for therapeutic use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref140">140</xref></sup></p><p>Recent initiatives such as the governmental (USA) Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to support the
development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and
diagnostics or the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)
public&#x02013;private partnership coordinated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are
crucial milestones in a coordinated effort to accelerate and prioritize the development of
the most promising vaccines and treatments. Initiatives like these that bridge government,
academia, and industry should also be continued past the current COVID-19 crisis so that we
can respond to future novel outbreaks rapidly and adequately.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="" id="notes-1"><title>Author Contributions</title><p><sup>#</sup> S.X. and A.D. contributed equally.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement" id="notes-2"><p>The authors declare no competing financial interest.</p></notes><bio id="BIO-d7e1973-autogenerated" rid="ath1"><p><bold>Siyu Xiu</bold> received his bachelor&#x02019;s degree in pharmacy from Shandong First
