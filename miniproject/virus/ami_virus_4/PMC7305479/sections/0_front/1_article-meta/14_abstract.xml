 <p>In this work, we describe the synthesis of 5-(perylen-3-ylethynyl)uridine and its ability to effectively inhibit the replication of respiratory disease pathogens in cell culture, namely: influenza A virus (IVA); type 3 parainfluenza virus (PIV-3); and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Related known compounds were also analyzed: 5-(perylen-3-ylethynyl)-2′-deoxy-uridine; 5-(perylen-3-ylethynyl)-arabino-uridine; and 1-carboxymethyl-3-pivaloyloxymethyl-5-(perylen-3-ylethynyl)uracil.</p>
