<p>Since March, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have been on lockdown (at different levels of severity), restricting many activities and businesses that involve gatherings of large numbers of people in close proximity. Currently (early June, 2020), countries across the globe are in different stages of easing lockdown restrictions. Public policies for behaviors and actions during this transition period vary widely across countries and within country jurisdictions. The present editorial will address potential policies that could minimize resurgence of the present pandemic (the 'second-wave') and reduce the likelihood and severity of similar future pandemics.</p>
