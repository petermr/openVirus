<p>Since the first case descriptions in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the development of diagnostic technologies at an unprecedented pace, and the pattern of collaborative scientific data sharing during this period has followed a similar path. A recent bibliometric study demonstrated that the research publication response to the COVID-19 pandemic was much more effective than in other recent epidemic events, namely the 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic and the 2014–16 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa (

Concerning only preprint publications, there were over 2,500 articles related to COVID-19 in the first 4 months of the pandemic, as opposed to only 88 articles in total related to both the Zika and Ebola viruses in the same epidemiological periods. Additionally, by the end of April, the total number of COVID-19 publications, including preprints and peer-reviewed articles, had already surpassed 16,000 (

When we searched PubMed specifically for scientific publications related to COVID-19 diagnostics (search terms: COVID-19 AND Diagnostics), it returned at least 930 specific papers in the first 5 months of the COVID-19 epidemic period (limited to December 2019–April 2020), while a similar search for Zika virus retrieved only nine publications related to diagnostics in the same time period (limited to March 2015–July 2015). Other recent publications have also discussed the efficiency of open data sharing during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly of epidemiological and diagnostic data, and how it contributed to early interventions (
