  <p>COVID-19 is one of the most widely affecting pandemics. As for many respiratory viruses-caused diseases, diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on two main compartments: clinical and paraclinical diagnostic criteria. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is vital in such a pandemic. On one side, rapidity may enhance management effectiveness, while on the other, coupling efficiency and less costly procedures may permit more effective community-scale management.</p>

  <title>Methodology and main structure</title>
  <p>In this review, we shed light on the most used and the most validated diagnostic tools. Furthermore, we intend to include few under-development techniques that may be potentially useful in this context. The practical intent of our work is to provide clinicians with a realistic summarized review of the essential elements in the applied paraclinical diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>
