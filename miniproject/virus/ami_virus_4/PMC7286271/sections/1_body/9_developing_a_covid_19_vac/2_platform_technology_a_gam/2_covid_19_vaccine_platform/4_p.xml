<p id="p0135">Recombinant vector virus vaccines are producing through recombinant DNA technology. This involves inserting the DNA encoding an antigen from the pathogen into bacteria or virus vectors, expressing the antigen in these cells, and then purifying it from them (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). During vaccination, the vector replicates and along with it the encoded DNA is expressed and processed, giving robust T cell and B cell immune response. Vectors may be bacteria like
