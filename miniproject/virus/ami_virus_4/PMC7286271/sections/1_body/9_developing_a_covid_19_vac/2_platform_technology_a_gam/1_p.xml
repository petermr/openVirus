<p id="p0115">The technology behind the development of vaccines in Research and Development (R&amp;D) has seen a transformation in the recent past. Over the year’s candidate vaccines were made through traditional methods of biotechnology. Because of this making of a prototype vaccine took between 2 to 5 years and was limited to a few types of vaccines. It needed the availability of cutting-edge research facilities to work with the infectious agent and was possible only in few laboratories over the globe (

Platform technology offers several advantages in the development of vaccines which include automation, speed, ability to develop several prototype vaccines from the single system, cost-effectiveness, and developing among other complex mRNA vaccines with ease. It is believed that the mRNA-based vaccine developed by platform technology appears particularly promising in terms of ease of manufacture, adaptability to various targets, and biological delivery (
