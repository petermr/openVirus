<p id="p0075">Are people who recover from COVID-19 infection protected from a second or a third infection? Should re-infections occur it would imply that immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is not protective, making possibilities of a successful vaccine difficult. There were scary reports from South Korea about patients thought to have recovered from COVID-19 had tested positive again (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). An intense debate started about re-activation or re-infections of the virus. Soon these reports were put to rest and the positive sample were found to be residual dead fragments of the virus, not the virus, which had re-activated or re-infected (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). After these reports, two groups of investigators have shown that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are protective. Bao et al showed that 2 monkeys who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection were protected from re-infection on the challenge during convalescence (

 <italic>PiCoVacc</italic> Sinovac Biotech to mice, rats, and non-human primates. The antibodies raised against the vaccine in animals showed neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains. Three immunizations of two doses (3μg or 6μg per dose) gave partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 (
