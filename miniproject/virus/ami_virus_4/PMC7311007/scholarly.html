Introduction</div> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic started in late 2019 in China has represented a substantial change in the health of the population worldwide, especially for families and children.<a href="#R1">1 2</a> This pandemic and the lack of effective treatment so far until now highlight the need to take measures to prevent the spread of the infection. Measures adopted at the beginning of the pandemic in almost all countries were based on the available evidence of previous epidemics like influenza, where children were major transmitters of the disease, even more than adults.<a href="#R3">3</a> Nevertheless, it should also be taken into account the data available from the current pandemic given there are several unknown questions. In the current situation, measures taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic are generally based on the precautionary principle, and these measures should balance the potential side effects with the infection itself.</p> <p>In the case of children, data available seem to indicate that they are equally susceptible to presenting infectious symptoms, although less severe compared with the adult population and the elderly.<a href="#R4">4</a> At the moment, there are no certainties about the possible causes of this situation. There is also insufficient information on the child population as a source of transmission of the infection. Despite this, in the majority of countries, one of the first measures adopted has been the closure of schools and even in some countries, such as Spain, the house confinement of all minors was specifically decided for at least 45 days.<a href="#R5">5</a> These strict measures taken with children present some controversies given that up to date there are many uncertainties regarding these issues in the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Given this situation and the uncertainty on the transmission mechanisms, prediction of severity, the spread of infection in asymptomatic patients or immunity after infection, a systematic scoping review of the published data was carried out to try to move forward in answering the following questions: are children more contagious than adults? Are they proportionally more asymptomatic?</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p>A rapid scoping literature review was carried out by search in PubMed using the following terms: â€œcoronavirus or COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2â€� and â€œneonates or pediatric or infant or children or adolescenceâ€� and â€œtransmissionâ€� to find reports of paediatric COVID-19. Google Scholar, MedRxiv/bioRxiv and secondary hand search have also been done. The time period was restricted to the last 6â€‰months, from 1 December 2019 and updated until 28 May 2020. Available full texts and the reference lists of the relevant studies were reviewed.</p> <div class="inclusion/exclusioncriteria" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Inclusion/exclusion criteria</div> <p>All studies published in English, Italian, French or Spanish related to the transmission of COVID-19 in children were included, as well as those comparing the percentage of asymptomatic patients according to age and also the source of contagion when this was possible.</p> <p>Studies that did not present data on childhood population were excluded, as well as those that focused the data exclusively on the level of severity and/or hospitalisations and/or paediatric intensive care units (PICU), or the treatment. All kind of studies (case series, cohort studies, comments, editorials, etc) were included although the emphasis was stated on those descriptive studies of cases. It is not ruled out that there may be some duplication in the cases included. A description of the results obtained was carried out. It was not attempted to rate the quality of included studies in this review.</p> </div> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

It should be taken into account that in the latter case series only 34% of cases of COVID-19 were confirmed and 66% were suspected cases.</p> <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span> <p>Characteristics of included studies and main results</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">First author/journal</td> <td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of study</td> <td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Publication date</td> <td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Country</td> <td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N total population</td> <td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of paediatric cases</td> <td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Asymptomatics</td> <td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Source of transmission/observations</td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cao <i>et al</i><a href="#R6">6</a><br /><br /><i>J Formosan Med Assoc</i></td> <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Review of reported cases</td> <td align="char" char="." valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 February</td> <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">China/Taiwan</td> <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44 672 laboratory confirmed cases</td> <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of reported cases comparing with adult population was 0.9% for &amp;lt;10â€‰years, and 1.2% for 10â€"20 years</td> <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Most showed mild symptoms.

Discussion</div> <p>The results of the present review suggest that children are as likely to be asymptomatic cases as frequently as adults, and that a high percentage of reported cases came from family transmission. Although there are still many uncertainties, it does not appear that children are transmitters to a greater extent than adults. As previously mentioned, the drastic measures taken in the child population in several countries have probably been based on previous epidemics such as influenza,<a href="#R20">20</a> without enough evidence of the current situation. Moreover, there are some theoretical reasons why school closures may be less effective in COVID-19 than in influenza outbreaks. A systematic review found that modelling studies of COVID-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only 2%â€"4% of deaths. This is much less than other social distancing interventions.<a href="#R21">21</a></p> <p>No studies were found on the subject of the present review from France, Italy, or the USA, countries strongly affected by the pandemic. Studies from these countries to date have been addressed mainly to analyse severity of identified paediatric cases, the need of PICU or immune responses in children.<a href="#R22">22â€"24</a> Nevertheless, the results of this review are likely to be generalisable including cases from different countries. Two of the included studies analysing school contacts found a extremely low level of transmission at school.<a href="#R15">15 18</a> Moreover, other very recent published reviews show also the low role of children as a factor of transmission in general.<a href="#R25">25 26</a></p> <p>Other secondary questions that come out from this review are the differences in the incubation period and the evidence that children (and probably also adults) can excrete the virus in faeces.<a href="#R6">6</a> According to some authors, asymptomatic individuals can actively shed the virus. Further, the incubation period in children following exposure to the virus can range upward of 24 days.<a href="#R27">27</a> Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. The majority of children infected by novel COVID-19s have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.<a href="#R4">4</a></p> <p>If children are important in viral transmission and amplification, social and public health policies (eg, avoiding interaction with elderly people) could be established to slow transmission and protect vulnerable populations. Nevertheless, the application of the precautionary principle should be evidence based as much as possible and try to avoid creating adverse effects with potential medium and long-term negative impact on the childhood population. A study analysing viral load by age in a sample of 3712 patients from Berlin found no differences by age on viral loads, even in the very young patients do not differ significantly from those of adults.<a href="#R28">28</a></p> <p>Several limitations of the present rapid scoping review should be mentioned. The inclusion of none reviewed preprint papers, the inclusion criteria based only on one evaluation, the lack of critical analysis of the risk of bias and the inclusion of non-primary study designs may weaken the attempts at understanding the data. However, the urgent need to understand the process of transmission and the results obtained provide a reasonable evidence on the process analysed. Furthermore, the results of other reviews on the process of infection in children with similar results to the present study support the strength of the results obtained. Another limitation is the current lack of reliable, valid and comparable data on epidemiological surveillance,<a href="#R29">29</a> on the diagnostic tests, and the scarce knowledge on the mechanism of transmission and prognostic.<a href="#R30">30 31</a> High-quality epidemiological studies are necessary to solve these questions with certain plausibility. On the other hand, up to date there are scarce data on the socioeconomic factors and its influence on the current pandemic. Social determinants of child health should be addressed to enhance the positive effects and avoid the adverse effects of this pandemic on childrenâ€™s rights and social inequalities in childrenâ€™s health.<a href="#R32">32</a></p> </div> <div class="supplementary-material" title="supplementary-material"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
