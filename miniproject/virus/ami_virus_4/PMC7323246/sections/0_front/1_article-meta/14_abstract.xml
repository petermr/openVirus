 <p>Since the first reports in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) rapidly developed into a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.</p>
 <p>Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune‐mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that may be triggered by various bacterial and viral infections. Reports on possible neurological manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 are still scarce. Hereby, we report a case of GBS after an infection with SARS‐CoV‐2.</p>
