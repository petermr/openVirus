<p>Human recombinant soluble ACE2 protein reduced the infection of Vero cell cultures and of organoids, with SAR‐CoV‐2 in a dose‐dependent way. Soluble ACE‐2 has two possible modes of action: first as a receptor decoy. Second, since ACE2 is a lung protection factor which is removed from the cell membrane during virus entry, a soluble ACE‐2 could also confer increased lung protection. This concept was developed for SARS, and the soluble ACE‐2 protein has already undergone clinical safety trials, but it is unknown whether it has clinical efficacy (Monteil
