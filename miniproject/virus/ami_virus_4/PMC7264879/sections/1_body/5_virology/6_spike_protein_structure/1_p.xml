<p>The coronavirus spike protein was intensively investigated because this knowledge will be crucial for vaccine development. One group determined the 3D structure of the spike protein from SARS‐CoV‐2 by cryo‐electron microscopy. It differs from SARS‐CoV (the coronavirus from the 2002 SARS epidemic, sharing the same cell receptor ACE‐2) over the receptor‐binding domain (RBD), allowing tighter binding to ACE‐2. Monoclonal antibodies directed to SARS‐CoV do not bind well to SARS‐CoV‐2, underlining distinct antigenicity. The proteolytic cleavage site (important for the fusion process mediating virus cell entry) is also different (Wrapp

The crystal structure of viral spike‐human receptor interaction was described by another group as a concave viral cup with a protruding ridge embracing closely the exposed N‐terminal end of the human ACE‐2 receptor. The novel coronavirus shows a larger binding interfacing, and more contacts to the receptor, than SARS‐CoV. The spike protein of a closely related bat coronavirus also mediated entry into cells via the ACE‐2 receptor. However, the bat spike protein was not cleaved upon entry, in contrast to SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, which contains a target site for the protease furin (Lan

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). A panel of mouse monoclonal antibodies, or neutralizing polyclonal antibodies directed against SARS‐CoV spike protein, failed to recognized the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, again demonstrating distinct epitope structures between the two viruses (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="mbt213592-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2020b</xref>). Due to amino acid and glycosylation differences between both viruses, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to SARS‐CoV binds only with 100‐fold lower affinity to the viral protein and lacks neutralizing activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 (Yuan et al.,
