<p>For the understanding and control of viral transmission dynamics in a population, it is important to know whether asymptomatic viral excreters exist. Isolated cases were documented. An asymptomatic adult contact of a patient showed the same viral pattern as the patient (Zou 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,

While most developed symptoms later, a 50‐year‐old woman, infected by her husband in his incubation period, remained healthy despite being virus positive in throat and anal swabs (Luo 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,
