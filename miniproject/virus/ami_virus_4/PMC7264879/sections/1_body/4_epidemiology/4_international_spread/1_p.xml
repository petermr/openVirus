<p>US epidemiologists evaluated the effect of the travel ban in Wuhan. A 90% travel reduction delayed virus transmission to mainland China by 1 week, but did not cause case reduction if not combined with local hygiene measures. The impact of travel restriction from Wuhan was internationally greater, but epidemic growth resumed after 2–3 weeks, since too many infected travellers remained undetected and had already seeded new epidemics (Chinazzi

Crossing a critical threshold would have occurred on January 25 and January 28 without travel restriction and with travel restrictions respectively. A major problem with airport control was that 64% of the infected travellers were pre‐symptomatic on arrival (Wells

Egypt, Algeria and South Africa were high‐risk countries. When calculating a preparedness and vulnerability index, an epidemic would have the greatest impact on Nigeria (Gilbert

Five of them developed mild disease during travel. They infected 1 out of 40 persons in a high‐risk category, but none out of 216 low‐risk contacts (Olsen
