Drug repositioning is an attractive approach that can facilitate the drug discovery process by repurposing existing pharmaceuticals to treat illnesses other than their primary indications. Here, we review current information concerning the global health issue of COVID-19 including promising approved drugs and ongoing clinical trials for prospective treatment options.

Accordingly, studying historical epidemics can help us identify patterns of viral outbreaks and design a plan to prepare for the next pandemic. For example, if the unusual influenza-like illness from February to August 1918 was considered a harbinger, then perhaps the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic could have resulted in fewer casualties (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Simonsen et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).

Soon afterward, authorities reported a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of clusters of the new illness (WHO, February 11, 2020). COVID-19 was the name that the WHO designated for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV and later severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gorbalenya, 2020</xref>). Since the beginning of the outbreak, infections have expanded rapidly into multiple simultaneous epidemics worldwide. At the time of writing, over 7.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 410,000 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported across more than 180 countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" id="intref0010">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html</ext-link>).</p><p id="p0020">The geographical distribution of COVID-19 covers all continents except Antarctica. Epidemiologists in Wuhan believe the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan to be the point of origin of SARS-CoV-2, due to its connection to the trading of live wild animals (WHO January 22, 2020) (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x000a0;al., 2020a</xref>). COVID-19 is highly contagious, with a basic reproduction number (<italic>R</italic>

Large-scale serologic screening provides a better picture of statistics related to asymptomatic infections for epidemiologic analysis.</p><p id="p0030">The phylogeny, virology, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 is being studied extensively. At the genome level, SARS-CoV-2 has 79.5% homology to SARS-CoV-1, the causative agent of SARS in south China; 85%&#x02013;96% identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), a bat SARS-like coronavirus (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>); and 91.02% similarity with SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus in pangolin named Pangolin-CoV (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Yu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). A population genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China revealed that the causative agent of COVID-19 consists of two evolution types. Type L (70% prevalence in Wuhan), which is derived from the ancestral type S (30% prevalence in Wuhan), is more aggressive and contagious (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Tang et&#x000a0;al., 2020b</xref>). Zhou et&#x000a0;al. investigated the COVID-19 agent through full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, classifying it as a betacoronavirus (a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus), the same subgenus as SARS-CoV as well as several bat coronaviruses (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x000a0;al., 2020b</xref>). In addition, they proved that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor binding (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]) and cell entry pathway as SARS-CoV-1. When compared with SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV is less closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Taken together, there is an urgent need for COVID-19 therapeutics due to the S-shaped curve expansion of the infections, widespread pandemic status, and global burden. Given the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, and its relative ease of sample acquisition and study, it has been widely accepted that drug repositioning is a promising approach to make available an effective, safety-assured treatment in a timely manner. In this review, we summarize diagnostic approaches, risk groups, available treatment options, and drug repositioning studies related to COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Diagnostic Approaches and Medical Comorbidities</title><p id="p0040">Before efficient treatment, precise diagnosis and classification of patients based on disease severity and their probable vulnerability to COVID-19 is crucial. Diagnosis has several steps that can be prioritized based on the provision of facilities during an outbreak. Generally, evaluation of symptoms and particular laboratory features that are associated with worse cases come first. Second, laboratory detection as a complementary test is done to confirm the infection. Clinical manifestations can help to classify patients and categorize efficient remedies for each cohort.</p><p id="p0045">At the beginning, due to the unknown nature of this emergent virus, all diagnosis was based purely on clinical and radiographic findings (i.e., bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging), failure of antibiotic therapy, and exclusion of other common respiratory infections (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Now, laboratory detection includes next-generation sequencing platforms, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serological methods like enzyme-linked immunoassay. Generally, a patient should be taken into account for laboratory detection if his or her clinical manifestations and/or radiographical records are positive. From the most common symptoms to the least&#x02014;these are not constant&#x02014;for COVID-19 fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgias, dyspnea, and sputum production are known so far (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020b</xref>). Recently, anosmia and dysgeusia have been added to this list as common symptoms (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Giacomelli et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, some less common complaints are headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., nausea and diarrhea) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">Another procedure that is being used to confirm the infection is monitoring laboratory features that are associated with worse outcomes. A positive correlation has been reported in worse cases between COVID-19 and sex (the rate of death for males was significantly more than that for females in China and Italy) (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Liang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Onder et al., 2020</xref>), lymphopenia, eosinopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, escalation of lactate dehydrogenase, increase of inflammatory markers, rise of D-dimer (&#x0003e;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL), elevated prothrombin time, elevation of troponin, increase in creatine phosphokinase levels, and also acute kidney injury (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Guan et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Several studies have been conducted to determine the risk groups for severe illness by SARS-CoV-2. People of any age cannot be excluded, but it is more associated with advanced age and medical comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic lung disease, cancer, and chronic kidney disease (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x000a0;al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">Considering antihypertensive medications, there are advocates for both use and cessation of consumption. It is still unclear whether the high mortality rate of patients with hypertension comorbidity is due to the pathology of disorder or the treatment used to cure it such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACE2 has been shown to be a co-receptor for viral entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). There is considerable evidence that shows the escalated expression level of ACE2 in the heart, brain, and even in urine after treatment with ARBs; however, there is limited evidence showing changes in serum or pulmonary ACE2 levels (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Patel and Verma, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2020c</xref>). In addition, serological, radiological, and histomorphological similarities of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) propose the postulation of triggering or simulating a form of organ-specific autoimmunity in predisposed patients. Also, some patients showed high-titer antiphospholipid antibodies, including anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-&#x003b2;2 glycoprotein antibodies (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2020d</xref>). The immunosuppressive therapy in identified patients with autoantibodies may prevent the development of respiratory failure.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Promising Approved Drugs and Available Clinical Trials for Prospective Treatment Options of COVID-19</title><p id="p0060">With regard to treatment, immunological and pharmaceutical investigations are still ongoing. No specific therapy for COVID-19 is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so far, but many previously approved drugs, as an efficient approach to drug discovery named drug repurposing, are being tested on COVID-19. At the time of writing, 1,137 interventional studies have been registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="intref0015">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" id="intref0020">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>) related to COVID-19, and this number is increasing progressively (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). In particular, the ongoing clinical trials sponsored by the WHO named Solidarity will compare different treatment options, namely, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir dual treatment, lopinavir/ritonavir dual treatment with interferon beta 1-alpha, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (paused temporarily due to the concerns raised about the safety of the drug) against standard of care. As of May 10, 2020, more than 100 countries have been confirmed to contribute in this investigation.</p><p id="p0065">The interventional drugs in clinical trials can be classified based on their nature and complementary effect.

Unfortunately, the most commonly used antiviral drugs are accompanied by severe obstacles including insufficient selectivity, resistance, promotion of latency, toxicity, or experimental difficulties (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq and Li, 2016</xref>). Drug repurposing approaches related to infectious diseases incorporate a variety of applications by harmonizing key bioinformatics and cheminformatics methods to discover a drug target that could be repurposed in the combat against a viral pathogen (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Turanli et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to indisputable cost-effective benefits in the practice of drug discovery, recycled drugs gain access into clinical trials instantly or are taken up with compassionate use programs, particularly in the context of untreatable viral diseases or pandemics. Furthermore, drug repurposing provides an alternative source of data for a novel understanding of metabolic reprogramming in viral infections, as well as the organic compounds with previously unrecognized antiviral behaviors that are possible to expand in unveiling properties of virus biology (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pizzorno et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). In various instances, drug repurposing identifies formerly undiscovered biomolecular networks, transforming them into novel pharmaceutical targets, even though the determined molecules may not be implemented into clinical trials (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Turanli et&#x000a0;al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p id="p0120">Over the last decade, the antiviral properties of repurposed drugs have gained considerable attention due to the lack of targeted treatments for specific emerging viruses (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Law et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Innumerable technical and bureaucratic challenges in <italic>de novo</italic> antiviral drug development have resulted in a very low therapeutic molecule approval rate, and as such, viral diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV are still without a vaccine. In recent years, dengue, Ebola, Zika, and coronaviruses have become public health crises, creating an ongoing demand for immediate and profitable therapeutics solutions by using antiviral drug repurposing approaches (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boldescu et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Particularly, when an epidemic occurs, prompt actions by known drugs might help to minimize the damage until virus-specific antiviral drugs or vaccines become available. For instance, niclosamide, a well-known antihelminthic drug, proved its repurposing potential for the treatment of Zika infections (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Another interesting candidate is chloroquine and its derivatives, which are normally indicated for malaria and have been extensively discussed in terms of their ability of the possible use for the treatment of COVID-19, as well as other diseases such as connective tissue disorders and some cancers including bladder, breast, colon, and prostate cancers (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cortegiani et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Notably, yet there is no FDA-approved therapy for neither Ebola nor Zika virus, but promising clinical research is ongoing.</p><p id="p0125">Drug repurposing methods are principally based on the analysis of biological data that make it possible to generate the hypotheses for rediscovery of available compounds for novel solutions in clinical practice and has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Pushpakom et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Here we summarize the most common computational drug repurposing approaches, and we detail the <italic>in silico</italic> drug repurposing studies of the current global health problem COVID-19.</p><p id="p0130">Computational drug repurposing approaches can be broadly categorized as (1) signature based, (2) molecular docking, (3) network based, and (4) genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Signature-based drug repositioning is comparison of the pattern of gene expression profiles of a drug against that of another drug (i.e., drug-drug comparison), disease (i.e., drug-disease comparison), or clinical phenotype by using high-throughput omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic), molecular structures, or adverse effect profiles (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Keiser et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Second, molecular docking is a key method in structure-based computational drug repurposing approaches based on predicting the ligand and the target complementation based on position and relative orientation of one molecule in the binding site of another molecule to generate a stable complex. Existing information of a receptor target associated with a disease enables researchers to inspect various potential drugs for a range of conditions. Reversely, libraries of compounds could be screened against receptor targets to investigate unknown interactions to discover candidates for drug repurposing process (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kitchen et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Another key approach for computational drug design is network-based drug repurposing, which is based on the construction of the biological networks by using different data types such as gene expression patterns, protein interactions, or disease pathology (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Greene and Voight, 2016</xref>). Finally, GWAS seek to determine the differences in genetic material related with common diseases and accordingly contribute a better understanding to the physiology of the diseases. The collected knowledge may also assist to define novel targets, a number of which could be allocated among diseases treated by medicine, and observable characteristics of the disease revealed by GWAS and therefore give rise to repurposing of drugs (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sanseau et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0135">
<italic>In silico</italic> drug repurposing methodologies have accelerated the studies in drug discovery through the use of data mining approaches, bioinformatics techniques, and predictive models for determining the efficacy and safety of the drugs. However, there is still a long way to reach the high success rates with repurposed drugs (e.g., repurposed candidates succeeded 9%&#x02013;67%, depending on the similarity between indicated and repurposed therapeutic areas, and the novel molecular entity success rate is &#x0223c;10%) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hay et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Neuberger et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). This is presumably attributable to the (1) heterogeneity and incompleteness of the available data, (2) flexibility and complexity of the entire biological system and pathophysiological conditions, and (3) lack of reliable experimental data and accurate parameters related to absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) and toxicity, just to name a few (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Patel, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ekins et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2020a</xref>). Future studies should be directed toward obtaining a more improved test standardization and proof of concept as well as integrating the big and heterogeneous amount of data into a harmonious workflow. To leverage the benefits, drug repurposing must be performed through aforethought procedures based on the advanced stage innovation. On account of clinical trials for drug development, regardless of repositioned drug or novel molecular entity, these are expensive and time consuming, so basic science methodologies (i.e., improved animal models, accurate toxicology assessment, biomarker identification, and novel targeted delivery technologies) that undertake and reduce the possibility of hypothesis risk will be essential to increase the success rate of repurposed drugs in the product development process (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Oprea et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title><italic>In Silico</italic> Drug Repurposing Studies for COVID-19</title><p id="p0140">Earlier studies with other viruses of the Coronaviridae family have identified the aforementioned ACE2 receptor (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) and RdRp (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Imbert et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), and also coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Xue et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) and papain-like protease (PLpro) (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kilianski et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), as candidate drug targets. An appealing biological target for coronaviruses is the main protease by virtue of its crucial role in viral gene expression and replication. Taking this into account, Zhang et&#x000a0;al. published the crystal structures of the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and docked it with a pyridone-containing &#x003b1;-ketoamide inhibitor. The assessment of pharmacokinetic results on mice revealed a noticeable lung tropism, which promises this lead compound as a suitable candidate for further drug development process (<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2020b</xref>). In addition, inhibiting the function of this enzyme blocks the viral life cycle. The absence of homologs in humans means that Mpro is an attractive non-toxic target for antiviral drug design that is not prone to off-target effects. Furthermore, virtual screening of main protease offers emergence of a powerful strategy for the rapid identification of candidate compounds from existing drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, gaining the attention of other research teams. For instance, Jin et&#x000a0;al. developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both structure-based drug design and high-throughput screening approaches to inform putative drug candidates against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. <italic>In silico</italic> screening followed by cell-based validation indicated that ebselen, a drug with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cytoprotective activities, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). These studies audibly support the view that an antiviral compound targeting Mpro could provide a strong defense against coronavirus-associated diseases.</p><p id="p0145">There are considerable opportunities in systematically investigating the dynamic interactions between host and SARS-CoV-2 to identify target human proteins for repurposing known drugs.

However, lack of data of the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection restrains the development of small molecule candidates based on the host-targeted strategies. Systematically mapping interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins revealed that inhibitors of mRNA translation and regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors might have antiviral activity (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>).
