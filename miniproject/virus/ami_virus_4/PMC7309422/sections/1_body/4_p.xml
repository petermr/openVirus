<p id="Par6">If COVID-19 would behave similar to other respiratory viruses causing respiratory infections including human corona viruses which peak during winter time and early spring, there is hope that the COVID-19 pandemic can be slowed down by this seasonal trend [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In those seasonal infections, no herd immunity is achieved during a specific season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This would go in a line with the duration of the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2002/2003, which also started in China, peaked in February to April and was terminated in summer 2003 although strict contact precaution measures were likewise the main secret of success [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, pandemics with new viruses such as the influenza H1N1v can circulate independent of typical respiratory viral seasons throughout the whole year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In line with this, the pandemic “Spanish flu” presented even with a summer peak in Scandinavia in the year 1918 preceding the major outbreak in the cold season of 1918/1919 in this area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This might be the only one published exception of an influenza summer epidemic. The next few months will provide a definitive answer to which scenario will hold true for the control of COVID-19 infections and how changes of temperature and social behavior will impact on the control of this pandemic.
