 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> plots the counts of respiratory diseases over the course of the years. It shows a strong seasonal pattern with peaks around the winter months December to March. The strongest upward deviations are observed in the years between 2008 and 2010 and for 2015. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> depicts the share of respiratory diseases and pools the information from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> into one graph. The smoothed lines represent a non-linear time trend based on year-wise regressions with the relative contributions of respiratory diseases per month as the dependent variable. In particular, we included a linear and a quadratic time trend, which allows to calculate predicted values and, in turn, the hump-shaped graphs in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. We also used more flexible functional forms, e.g., higher order polynomials, but it turned out that the quadratic specifications performed well in terms of overall fit; a pooled regression over all seasons led to an
