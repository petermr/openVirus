<p id="Par5">The colored lines plot the seasons in which previous pandemic respiratory infections have been recorded (02/03 SARS-CoV, purple line; 04/05 H5N1, green line; 09/10 pandemic flu, blue line) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] but not showing the absolute contributions of these pandemic infections to the total number of respiratory infections. The grey lines indicate seasons where no specific pandemic respiratory infections are recorded. In line with Fig.
