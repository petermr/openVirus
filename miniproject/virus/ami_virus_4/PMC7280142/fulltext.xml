Sixteen nonstructural proteins (NSPs; NSP1&#x02013;16) derived from pp1a/pp1ab play specific roles in the replication of CoVs and in the formation of replication-transcription complex that facilitates synthesis of minus-strand messenger RNA called subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs; <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). While NSPs are conserved among CoVs, there is diversity between structural proteins of CoVs, implicating their functional contribution to the infectivity, adaptation, and transmission.

Only one-third of the genome serves as a template for four structural proteins that are functionally involved in the infection process. The four structural proteins include the membrane (M), spike (S), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N); all accessory proteins are derived from sgRNA and are critical for infection.</p><p>2019-nCOV = 2019 novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sgRNA = subgenomic RNA.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="par0030">Structural Spike (S) proteins drive the entry of the CoVs SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into target host cells by engaging the cellular receptor ACE2. Analogous to SAR-CoV infection, interaction of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with cellular ACE2 facilitates the attachment of the virus to target cells <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This step is also functionally associated with the activation of cellular TMPRSS2, a type-II transmembrane serine protease that drives the entry of virus into the target cell and is regulated by androgens (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
). SARS-CoV infection is dependent on the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2 and results in cleavage of SARS S protein at multiple sites <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Proteolytic cleavage of SARS S protein by TMPRSS2, known as S priming, mediates efficient virus-host cell fusion and decreases virus sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.<fig id="fig0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Molecular pathway of SARS-CoV-2 activation in host cells.

Ang I is converted to Ang II by ACE. However, ACE2 depletes Ang I and II levels by directly catalyzing the compounds and converting Ang I to Ang 1&#x02013;9 and Ang II to Ang 1&#x02013;7, known vasodilators acting through receptor Mas (MasR) with antifibrotic, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), which block the conversion of Ang I to Ang II, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which block the downstream interaction of Ang II with the Ang II type I (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptor, are used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. While these treatments do not directly modulate ACE2, they cause an increase in ACE2 expression <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Other medications, such as thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen, are speculated to increase ACE2 levels also <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Further, ACE2 levels are elevated in patients with multiple cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, and hypertension, those who are at a greater risk of mortality in COVID-19 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, RAS inhibition may affect COVID-19 outcomes by decreasing the proinflammatory activity of Ang II or increasing the virulence of the virus in the heart and lungs due to the increased ACE2 expression <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p id="par0040">Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes, epithelia of small intestine, and podocytes and the border of proximal tubule cells of the kidney, thus making these organ sites easy routes for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In particular, ACE2 expression is higher in the kidneys than in any other organ, with potentially 100 times higher expression than in the lungs <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Podocytes and proximal straight tubule cells of the kidney share similar homology and have highly enriched signatures for kidney disease&#x02013;related signaling pathways <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. It is therefore of critical importance to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on patients with prior kidney issues as well as assess the potential risk of developing kidney injury once infected with COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="sec0025"><label>3.2</label><title>Epidemiology of COVID-19 and cancer</title><p id="par0045">The COVID-19 pandemic created unique circumstances and challenges for cancer patients, including patients with renal cancer and their clinical providers across the clinical care continuum and management trajectory (ie, cancer diagnosis, treatment, follow-up care, end of life). Epidemiological evidence so far indicates that cancer patients have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, developing complications, and deteriorating more rapidly <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Specifically, the mortality rate is significantly higher among SARS-CoV-2&#x02013;infected patients with active cancer (28.6%) than in patients with other comorbidities. Older cancer survivors are more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of existing chronic, comorbid health conditions (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases) <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Cancer patients presenting at clinics and hospitals for cancer care might have increased exposure to other infected patients and clinical care personnel, leading to increased risk of COVID-19, morbidity, and mortality.</p><p id="par0050">To reduce cancer patients&#x02019; risk of exposure, difficult clinical decisions have to be made by physicians about for whom, how, and when to provide cancer treatment and follow-up care <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, delays in cancer management might lead to missed opportunities for curative treatment and increased risks of cancer progression to metastasis, anxiety, and stress. For patients experiencing metastatic or recurrent cancer, considerations should include how such delays may lead to immediate need for hospital-based palliative care and symptom management <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. For patients receiving treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, or those who have undergone recent surgery, the risks are even higher because of the reduced immune system function. Reinforcement of the strict &#x0201c;stay at home&#x0201d; policy, although efficient in reducing the risk of exposure and contamination, is likely to increase patient clinical care (eg, managing disease and comorbidities), financial (eg, loss of job and medical insurance), and psychosocial (eg, social isolation, fear of contamination, stress, and anxiety) needs, thus worsening the quality of life and emotional well-being in a population already burdened by cancer and treatment impact.</p><p id="par0055">To address some of these needs, several hospitals and clinics in the USA have adopted a telehealth care delivery approach; however, such shifts in care delivery approaches may pose significant challenges, especially for patients with limited access to Internet or computer skills <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. For patients participating in cancer clinical trials, forced stay home or quarantine complicates hospital attendance for repeat appointments and continuity in care, and when severe complications or emergencies occur, treatment delays or unavailability will have significant implication for the patient&#x02019;s health <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

With the inactivation of this gene, the result is a subsequent downstream upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors, which then causes angiogenesis and proliferation, mostly through the activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Antiangiogenesis treatment of RCC includes the use of monoclonal antibodies that bind and deplete VEGF ligand, or bind to the VEGFR and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that block the intracellular domain of VEGFR.

The efficacy of ICIs in conjugation with COVID-19 infection is under intense investigation. Recent evidence suggests that restoration of immunocompetence with ICIs impacts the development of cytokine release syndrome and contributes to the severity of COVID-19 and ARDS <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Additionally, CoV-related interstitial pneumonia could be worsened by potential pneumological toxicity from anit-PD-1/PD-L1 ICI agents.
