    "SARS-CoV-2, a novel emerging coronavirus, has caused severe disease (COVID-19), and rapidly spread worldwide since the beginning of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 mainly spreads by coughing, sneezing, droplet inhalation, and contact. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in saliva samples, making saliva a potential transmission route for COVID-19. The participants in dental practice confront a particular risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to close contact with the patients and potential exposure to saliva-contaminated droplets and aerosols generated during dental procedures. In addition, saliva-contaminated surfaces could lead to potential cross-infection. Hence, the control of saliva-related transmission in the dental clinic is critical, particularly in the epidemic period of COVID-19. Based on our experience of the COVID-19 epidemic, some protective measures that can help reduce the risk of saliva-related transmission are suggested, in order to avoid the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 among patients, visitors, and dental practitioners."
