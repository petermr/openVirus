<p id="p0025">For example, if we assume an approximate median between the most conservative (lowest) and insightful (highest) estimates for the reproductive number of the virus under the unconstrained conditions before interventions were introduced (

 </sub>) at the outset of well-documented outbreaks, a baseline value of 4.0 seems as reasonable as any (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Killeen &amp; Kiware, 2020</xref>). From this assumed starting point, a country that contains its epidemic sufficiently to flatten the curve to a plateau, so that the rate of incidence of new infections remains constant, would have achieved a controlled reproductive number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>) of exactly 1.0 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Relative to where that country started, this minimum containment level required to prevent the epidemic from growing further would represent a 75% reduction of transmission (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Countries like Ireland, France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, where daily incidence rates are now slowly falling (
 <italic>Rc</italic> &lt; 1.0), so their epidemics could slowly fizzle away if current measures were maintained, may well have achieved 80% suppression of transmission (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B and C). If sustained, current measures in these countries could be expected to see their incidence rates shrink by 98% but not disappear over the course of a year (
