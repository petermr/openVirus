<p id="p0035">While these levels of transmission suppression may sound very high, several countries (notably China (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2020</xref>), which was hit first and without warning at the outset) have achieved controlled reproductive numbers and incidence shrinkage rates in this approximate range, so they are beginning to approach elimination targets. Furthermore, such impressive reductions of transmission rate and relatively rapid escape trajectories from self-sustaining local transmission may be far easier to rationalize in simple arithmetic terms by considering two important, intuitive and encouraging non-linearities of pathogen outbreak and containment dynamics: (1) Transmission requires exposure behaviours by two individuals, so transmission varies in proportion to the square of the relative rates of those preventable exposure behaviours, and (2) Even modest acceleration of proportional decay rates can dramatically curtail the length of time it takes for them to approach zero.
