 <sec>
  <title>Material and methods</title>
  <p>The cancer patients who died of covid-19 during the analysis period have been reviewed describing the oncological and the covid-19 infection characteristics and the treatments established.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Confirmed cases covid-19: 1069 with 132 deaths (12.3%). With cancer 36 patients (3.4%), 15 deceased (41.6%). Of the deceased, only 6 patients (40%) were in active treatment. The most frequent associated tumor was lung (8/15 patients, 53.3%), 11 with metastatic disease (11/15, 73.3%). No specific treatment was established in 40% (6/15) of the patients. The rest of them received treatments with the active protocols.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Covid-19 mortality in cancer patients is almost four times higher than that of the general population. Until we have effective treatments or an effective vaccine, the only possibility to protect our patients is to prevent the infection with the appropriate measures.</p>
