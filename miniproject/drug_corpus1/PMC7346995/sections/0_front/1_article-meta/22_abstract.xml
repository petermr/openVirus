 <p>Although a viral infection is a major triggering factor of asthma and allergic diseases, asthma is suggested to be not a predisposing condition for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. However, patients with severe asthma/allergic disease requiring systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents may be at higher risk of more severe clinical course of this infectious disease. For allergic patients who have been followed up at an allergy clinic in our region, it is recommended that they (patients with asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis or chronic urticaria) continue to receive maintenance therapy and be in a well-controlled status. Patients who have used biologics (currently available for targeting type 2 inflammation) and allergen immunotherapy should continue the treatment while minimizing hospital and face-to-face visits. It is essential to wear protective equipment for the protection of health care workers as well as patients. We report this consensus to support allergists and clinical immunologists to make optimal decisions under the urgent situation in Asia.</p>
