 <p>Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is rapidly spreading all over the world. Excessive immune responses trigger life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which can result in overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1β with different pro-inflammatory roles. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the modulation of systemic immune responses may have a potential role in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Given the importance of the issue and the lack of therapeutic treatment or vaccine; anti-cytokine therapy such as IL-6, TNFα and IL-1 antagonists have been suggested for the alleviation of hyper-inflammation status in these patients. In this mini-review, we addressed the inflammatory pathways of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its relationship with the host cytokine storm. Furthermore, the proposed therapeutic options to reverse hyper-inflammation in infected patients were mentioned.</p>
