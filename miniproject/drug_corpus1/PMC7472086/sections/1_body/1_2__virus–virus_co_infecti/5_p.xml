 <italic>Caliciviridae:</italic> Norovirus (NoV) has emerged as a leading cause of pediatric gastroenteritis [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], in addition to its well-established role in epidemic diarrheal disease in adults in healthcare settings and cruise ships [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. NoV GII strains are the most common viral cause of epidemic AGE worldwide, with GII.4 strains most frequently associated with person-to-person transmission, due to their extremely contagious nature and their rapid rate of genetic and antigenic evolution [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Indeed, NoV causes ~18% of all cases of diarrhea in outpatient and inpatient settings among all age groups [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. NoV has been shown to infect both immune cells and enteroendocrine cells of the small intestinal epithelium in immunocompromised patients [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Though less widely appreciated as a cause of AGE, sapovirus (SaV) is another member of the 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family that causes diarrheal illness similar to NoV, especially in young children and the elderly, and frequently closely follows NoV in prevalence [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although there are several NoV vaccines in development and two in clinical trials (bivalent GI.1/GII.4 vaccine and monovalent GI.1 oral vaccine) [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], there are no licensed vaccines against NoV or SaV.
