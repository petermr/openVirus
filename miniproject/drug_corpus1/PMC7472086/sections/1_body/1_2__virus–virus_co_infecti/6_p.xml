 <italic>Astroviridae:</italic> Astroviruses (AstV) are causative agents of diarrheal disease particularly in children and immunocompromised patients. Few studies report AstV-mediated AGE in normal healthy adults, but most children are infected with AstV and develop antibodies to the virus early in life [
