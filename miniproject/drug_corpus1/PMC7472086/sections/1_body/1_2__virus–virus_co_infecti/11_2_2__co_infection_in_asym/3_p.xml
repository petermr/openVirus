<p>While co-infections are thus prevalent even in the absence of symptoms, the literature does suggest that, in matched cohorts, co-infection rates tend to be higher in cases of AGE than in asymptomatic controls. The analysis of samples from a Japanese daycare revealed that 1.6% of stools from asymptomatic children exhibited viral co-infections, whereas viral co-infections accounted for 5.7% of AGE cases [
