<p>Though co-infections are more commonly thought of as viruses from different viral families mediating simultaneous infection, they can, of course, also include concurrent infections by multiple viral strains or species of the same viral genus. An investigation by the Rota-net Italy Study Group demonstrated that mixed infections with two or more RV strains were present in 7.6% of their samples, with G1 + G9P(8) strains representing the most common mixed infections in children with AGE [

In a study investigating the extensive RV genomic variation during chronic infection in immunocompromised children, patients unable to clear their initial RV infection were subsequently co-infected with other circulating RV strains leading to prolonged life-threatening diarrhea [

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], but as enteroviruses are now increasingly appreciated as causative agents for AGE, increased testing may also increase co-infection detection rates. Continuously improving techniques for carefully genotyping enteric viruses in clinical samples will likely continue to reveal frequent co-infections by closely-related viruses.
