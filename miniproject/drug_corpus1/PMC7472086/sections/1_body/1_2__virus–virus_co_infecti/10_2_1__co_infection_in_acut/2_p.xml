<p>During epidemic AGE outbreaks, such as those that occur from contaminated water, co-infection with multiple unrelated viruses can be common. For example, in a pediatric AGE outbreak in Finland, in which drinking water was contaminated by sewage, RV was detected in 66% of cases, calicivirus including either NoV or SaV in 62%, and both in 40% [
