<p>While some recent studies have suggested that co-infections with bacterial or viral enteropathogens do not alter RV vaccine efficacy in a statistically significant manner, across these studies there is a trend for an 8–11% increase in vaccine efficacy against severe RV diarrhea in children who were not co-infected [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Thus, it remains possible that viral co-infections are an important contributor to decreased vaccine efficacy in settings with high enteropathogen burdens. Further work will be needed to fully clarify the impact of enteric viral infections on the induction of effective protective responses with vaccination, and will continue to be an important consideration as vaccines are developed for other enteric viruses, such as NoV.
