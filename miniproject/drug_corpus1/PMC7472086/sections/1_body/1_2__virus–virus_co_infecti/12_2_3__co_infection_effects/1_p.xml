<p>As discussed above, vaccines are currently available for PV and RV, but not for other enteric viruses associated with AGE. These vaccines are administered in early childhood, which is also the most common period for viral co-infections to occur. The inhibitory effect of human enteroviruses on OPV efficacy has been recognized for many decades, and indeed has contributed to attempts to vaccinate children in months when these viruses were circulating at lower levels [

 <xref rid="B119-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. A systematic review supports that concurrent enterovirus infection is consistently associated with decreased seroconversion for some types of PV, and in general that concurrent diarrhea which could be attributed to different enteropathogens is associated with decreased per-dose seroconversion overall [

 <xref rid="B121-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. In addition to enterovirus infections inhibiting effective immune responses to OPV, there have been more recent studies suggesting these may also impair effective RV vaccine responses. Diminished RV IgA and failure to seroconvert after RV vaccination were associated with concurrent enterovirus infections in a cohort of infants in urban Bangladesh [
