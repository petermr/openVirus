 <italic>Adenoviridae</italic>: Adenoviruses (AdV) are non-enveloped DNA viruses known to cause conjunctivitis, upper and lower respiratory disease, and AGE. AdV can be transmitted via respiratory droplets, fomites, and fecal–oral transmission, and predominantly infects the respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Epidemiological data indicate that the majority of AdV infections occur in children less than 5 years of age, but AdV epidemics are also common in adults. AdV genotypes 40 and 41 are commonly associated with AGE in pediatric populations worldwide [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The intestinal tract also appears to be a common site of AdV reactivation under conditions of immunosuppression [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], whereas in acquired immunodeficiency associated with HIV infection, AdV infections are more commonly associated with AGE [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Although AdV infection in the respiratory tract is well characterized, gastrointestinal infection is less well-understood in terms of cell tropism, entry mechanism and intestinal immune responses [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. AdV is prevalent in intestinal biopsies from healthy individuals, with co-infection by multiple strains commonly detected. AdV DNA has been found in lamina propria lymphocytes, but the full cellular tropism of human AdV remains unclear [
