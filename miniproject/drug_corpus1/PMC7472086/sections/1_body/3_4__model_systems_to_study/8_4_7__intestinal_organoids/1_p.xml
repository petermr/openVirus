<p>In the last decade, pioneering work from several groups has demonstrated the capacity of pluripotent intestinal stem cells to develop into complex intestinal structures in cell culture, closely mimicking their in vivo counterparts. Two types of intestinal organoids are used for studying enteric viruses—organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells, known as human intestinal organoids (HIOs), or organoids derived from intestinal crypts grown in three dimensional cultures, known as human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) [
