<p>While mechanistic explorations of viral co-infections in the intestine have been limited, there are several useful model systems available to explore the pathogenesis of individual viruses which could be applied to co-infection studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00904-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Here, we describe these models, and suggest that these may permit us to address remaining fundamental questions: How does co-infection alter the lifecycle, replication, and tropism of individual viruses? Do individual viruses promote or prevent infection by subsequent viral agents? Do co-infections ultimately alter disease outcomes? The use of animal models and in vitro tools will be key to dissecting the molecular underpinnings in enteric virus co-infections.
