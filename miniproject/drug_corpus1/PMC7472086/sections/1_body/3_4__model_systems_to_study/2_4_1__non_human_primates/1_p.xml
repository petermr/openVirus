<p>Non-human primates (NHPs), including Vervet monkeys (
 <italic>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</italic>), Rhesus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>), and pigtailed macaques (
 <italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>) have been used extensively to study enteric viral infections [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. NHPs share many anatomical, immunological, and physiological similarities with humans and thus are excellent models to recapitulate the pathogenesis of enteric virus infections and/or co-infection in humans [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. NHPs are susceptible to some human enteric viruses, making studies of human viral co-infections potentially tractable [

 <xref rid="B145-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Indeed, many simian viruses isolated from NHPs in the wild or in captivity, including simian RV and rhesus enteric caliciviruses, are also important pathogens for in vitro and in vivo studies, such as viral receptor identification and determination of adaptive immune responses [

 <xref rid="B148-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. In fact, research in simian RV led to the formulation of the first commercial vaccines against human RV [

 <xref rid="B149-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Virome studies in NHPs suggest that, especially when immunocompromised by infection with simian immunodeficiency virus, natural enteric viral co-infections may be common [
 <xref rid="B150-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>,
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. However, experimental co-infection with enteric viruses remains a relatively unexplored area.
