<p>Notably, the frequency of co-infection, and the identity of implicated viruses, can be drastically altered with the introduction of immunization programs. For example, PV and RV vaccination programs dramatically reduced infection rates in communities worldwide. Thus, as vaccines are developed for other enteric viral pathogens, there may continue to be robust shifts in viral co-infection prevalence. We are also now developing an increasing appreciation that the commensal microbiota, diet, and host genetics may have complex regulatory effects on enteric viruses, all of which may variably contribute to disease outcomes from infection as well. Thus, there remains much to be discovered in terms of physiological effects of co-infections and other host factors on disease severity, immune defense mechanisms and vaccine responses. Although the different models discussed in this review have been used to study the pathogenesis of individual enteric viruses, our knowledge regarding enteric viral co-infections lags far behind. We suggest that these models could be used as a toolkit for targeted studies exploring clinically relevant enteric virus co-infections, thereby allowing us to carefully dissect the individual contributions of the many complex factors that control these pathogens.</p>
