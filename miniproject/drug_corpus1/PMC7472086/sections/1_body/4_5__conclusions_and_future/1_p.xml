<p>Single pathogens have been classically understood to be the etiologies of AGE. As the evidence for virus–virus co-infections grows, however, it is evident that the causative agents for this disease are often co-infecting viruses, and indeed that these co-infections may be occurring even in the absence of symptoms.

There is a great remaining need for careful exploration of the effects of co-infection on symptom severity and duration, as well as development of protective immunity, in clinical cohorts.</p>
