<p>Viral interference is a phenomenon first recognized in the 1950’s, wherein a cell infected by a virus is resistant to a second super-infecting virus, mediated by interferons (IFNs) [

While few studies have interrogated enteric viral co-infections in mice to date, we recently uncovered viral interference as an unexpected outcome in immunocompromised mice. We observed that chronic murine AstV infection in severely immunodeficient mice protected mice from both persistent murine NoV and murine RV infection [

 <xref rid="B141-viruses-12-00904" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Further details of this intrinsic defense mechanism remain to be uncovered, as do the nuances of differential viral strain effects, cell type-specific IFN-λ expression, and positive and negative regulation of heterologous antiviral responses. It is likely this is an important mechanism regulating viral outcomes in the intestine.
