<p>Poliovirus is one of the smallest human viruses, only a quarter the size of SARS-CoV-2. It is an Enterovirus and is spread via fecal-oral transmission. It has likely caused human illness and nerve damage for millennia, but an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) syndrome in children was first described in London in 1798. Epidemics of polio accompanied the urbanization of the industrial revolution with increasingly dense living conditions and poor sanitation. It is a summer virus, and in the first half of the 20th century parents lived in fear of the arrival of the “polio season” and the possibility of their child’s permanent paralysis. Outbreaks in the ’40s and ’50s, within living memory, would shut swimming pools, summer camps, and send children into enforced summer lockdown indoors. One of the first successful vaccines developed was against poliovirus, the inactivated poliovirus injection, which reduced annual incidence by 90% through the late ’50s and early ’60s. The oral poliovirus vaccine completed the eradication of the infection from North America and Northern Europe [
