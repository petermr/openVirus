<p>Despite the wealthier parts of the world having the irresponsible luxury of vaccine denial and tolerance for measles outbreaks, which have been increasing in the last 5 years, the poorer parts of the globe cannot afford this. In 2018 there were outbreaks of measles on every continent and 2019 was probably worse. The vaccine requires 2 separate doses for reliable immunity, and only 69% of children received both in 2018. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from pediatrician vaccine orders and administration records measured a marked drop in measles vaccination coinciding with the COVID-19 lockdown [

This year at least a 2-month long cohort of the world’s children may have no protection against this most infectious of diseases. They may face consequent morbidity and mortality that will dwarf their risks from COVID-19.
