<p>In listing these diseases we do not wish to diminish the seriousness of COVID-19 but to provide perspective. The necessary public health response to limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 should be integrated in both the time-honored and newly established responses for the control of tuberculosis, HIV, and vaccine-preventable diseases and not provided in a separate silo. It should be possible to integrate SARS-CoV-2 screening and testing into existing public health programs, strengthening both. Active screening and testing to identify early and asymptomatic cases, rapid isolation and treatment of cases, efficient tracing of contacts of cases, and support for treatment completion or lifelong therapy for TB and HIV have been successfully integrated in many countries. Vaccines, where available, must be efficiently administered using existing pathways and personnel and their delivery not interrupted. We will need these pathways for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, hopefully soon. Most low- and middle-income countries are quite experienced and adept at implementing these public health programs and have systems already in place. They have to be maintained and strengthened. COVID-19 programs have to be added and integrated, not substituted.</p>
