<p>SARS-CoV-2, without question, represents a great threat to global health and welfare. It has joined a long list of endemic and epidemic diseases. We have illustrated only a few, but there are many more, such as malaria, that could have been included. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has suspended international and national programs, and the impact on these public health priorities is likely to be profound and long lasting. The key components of these programs on the ground are the human resources that make them run and the supply chains that provide the materials to the point of prevention and care. The lockdown has limited access to healthcare workers, many of whom have been forced out of the workplace by strict national enforcement of social distancing. The reductions in international flow of goods and services and increased cross-border restrictions has reduced the flow of medicines, diagnostics, and reagents worldwide. Addressing COVID-19 successfully while maintaining the fragile systems of prevention and care for other global health threats is key.</p>
