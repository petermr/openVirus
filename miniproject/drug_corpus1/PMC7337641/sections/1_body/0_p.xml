<p>The world has shut down. Global commerce has screeched to a halt, the movement of people stopped, and the supply of goods has slowed. As the world watched the agonies of Wuhan, the virus was already spreading among us and left many countries with only one option—lockdown. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has surely been a severe reminder of the natural laws of epidemiology that still govern human society. It has sadly exacted the highest toll on the more vulnerable people in our communities. The world of public health needed no reminders of the social determinants of health. The unfair distribution of health and wealth is the shame of our planet, and there are many more deadly epidemic reminders of this than the coronavirus. These communicable diseases were with us before and will be with us after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic subsides. Progress has been made combating them, but success is fragile and endangered as one of the many collateral damages wrought by COVID-19. In our compelling need to focus on COVID-19 we may lose sight of other existing epidemics, and the tally of morbidity and mortality will add to and ultimately dwarf the toll of COVID-19 itself.</p>
