 <p>SARS‐CoV‐2, a novel emerging coronavirus, has caused severe disease (COVID‐19), and rapidly spread worldwide since the beginning of 2020. SARS‐CoV‐2 mainly spreads by coughing, sneezing, droplet inhalation, and contact. SARS‐CoV‐2 has been detected in saliva samples, making saliva a potential transmission route for COVID‐19. The participants in dental practice confront a particular risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection due to close contact with the patients and potential exposure to saliva‐contaminated droplets and aerosols generated during dental procedures. In addition, saliva‐contaminated surfaces could lead to potential cross‐infection. Hence, the control of saliva‐related transmission in the dental clinic is critical, particularly in the epidemic period of COVID‐19. Based on our experience of the COVID‐19 epidemic, some protective measures that can help reduce the risk of saliva‐related transmission are suggested, in order to avoid the potential spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 among patients, visitors, and dental practitioners.</p>
