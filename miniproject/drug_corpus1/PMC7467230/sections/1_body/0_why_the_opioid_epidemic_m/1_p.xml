<p>The epidemiology of the US opioid epidemic continues to evolve and presents new challenges. In recent years, the epidemic has shifted from prescription opioid pills to injection of illicitly produced opioids, including heroin and fentanyl, with concomitant increasing injection of stimulants including cocaine and methamphetamine [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>]. As a result, the incidence of injection drug use (IDU)-related infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and invasive bacterial and fungal infections, including 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteremia, endocarditis, and skin and soft tissue infections, is rising [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–11</xref>]. Injection of fentanyl or heroin alone and in combination with stimulants have led to new HIV outbreaks among people who use drugs throughout the country [

 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>]. In addition to HIV, both acute HCV and HBV infection incidence has mirrored the rise in injection opioids [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and hospitalizations for injection opioid-related endocarditis have increased more than 12-fold in recent years [
