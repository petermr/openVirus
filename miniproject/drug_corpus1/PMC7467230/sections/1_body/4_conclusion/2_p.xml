<p>We are at a pivotal moment in the opioid epidemic in the United States. As we desperately attempt to decrease the staggering number of overdose deaths, we must also grapple more broadly with IDU in general, which is causing increases in HIV, HCV, and other IDU-related infections. As a result, we as infectious disease specialists need a paradigm shift in our clinical approach, and we need broad and aggressive policy changes to support that shift. Throughout history, infectious diseases clinicians have risen to the challenge. In 1998, Dr Jonathan Mann said in an address, “When the history of AIDS and the global response is written, our most precious contribution may well be that, at a time of plague, we did not flee, we did not hide, we did not separate ourselves.” This time is no different—it is our epidemic too.</p>
