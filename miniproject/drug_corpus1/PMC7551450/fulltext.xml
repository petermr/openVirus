Beyond technical solutions, the government of South Korea needs to establish a timely strategic investment in coronavirus-related research and development (R&#x00026;D) in order to enhance the capabilities for managing this new uncertainty in regard to the domestic health crisis. Thus, this study aims to provide useful information about the status of global coronavirus-related research from the South Korean government&#x02019;s perspective. National funded projects stemmed from leading nations such as the United States, countries of the European Union, and Japan between 2012 and 2018. Six research fields were derived by clustering analysis and an expert-based approach, and then matched to those of South Korea. The comparative analysis among them allowed for the identification of the nations&#x02019; strengths and weaknesses, thereby laying the groundwork for strategic international research collaborations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>international cooperation</kwd><kwd>national scientific funds</kwd><kwd>cluster analysis</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>health policy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-healthcare-08-00204"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The third zoonotic human coronavirus of the century emerged in December 2019, with a cluster of patients with connections to Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [<xref rid="B1-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The cases of those infected in China had spread to the US, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea (hereafter Korea) on a smaller scale by early February. The confirmed cases in other countries increased [<xref rid="B3-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and a global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was eventually declared by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 [<xref rid="B4-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The world has already learned the importance of working collaboratively to overcome two global outbreaks, which stemmed from the SARS outbreak of 2002 and the MERS outbreak of 2012. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to develop a vaccine for human trials. In 2015, researchers were able to prepare a vaccine for the Zika virus in just six months [<xref rid="B5-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>As the world is increasingly interconnected and the COVID-19 epidemic continues [<xref rid="B6-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], it is of the utmost importance for both the developed and developing nations to facilitate international cooperation and to protect the health of the world&#x02019;s population [<xref rid="B7-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At the center of the WHO, its networks of researchers and other experts have coordinated global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modeling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and on researching other ways to identify and manage the disease and limit its onward transmission [<xref rid="B5-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], thereby reducing the probability of the high lethality of viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H5N1, H7N9, and Ebola [<xref rid="B10-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In order to contribute to the treatment and prevention of the virus with the collaborative efforts of countries around the world, much research will continue to be conducted in the fields of pathogen monitoring, source identification, primary etiology, clinical treatments, vaccine development, viral replication, pathogenesis, antiviral drugs, and others [<xref rid="B9-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The US CDC, as well as other national governmental bodies, has the explicit goal of preventing sustained outbreaks like COVID-19 within their borders but also makes significant contributions to ongoing publicly shared research in disease transmission, diagnostics, vaccine development, and therapeutics, as well as offering guidelines to front-line clinicians and coordinating with both the WHO and local health departments [<xref rid="B12-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Although the world is already preparing to tackle the newest emergent virus strain [<xref rid="B1-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], vaccine research and development are highly complex and require concerted public funding efforts for a long period of time [<xref rid="B8-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B13-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In order to improve the efficiency of the allocation of the funding for infectious disease-related R&#x00026;D, it is necessary to understand the current trends of coronavirus disease-related scientific research funding around the world to consider the directions for the global collaborative research and development [<xref rid="B14-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>It was first reported that a patient in Korea was infected with COVID-19 on 20 January 2020 in Korea (ncov.hohw.go.kr); community-based spread dramatically occurred in Korea [<xref rid="B16-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], thereby positioning it as one of the first countries to have an outbreak beside China, based on reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. As of 6 March 2020, 17,481 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed outside China, 6284 of which were confined to South Korea (42 deaths). Italy (3858 confirmed cases and 148 deaths) and Iran (3513 confirmed cases and 107 deaths) were ranked next (WHO 2020 Situation Report-46) [<xref rid="B3-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The Korean government and its other agencies, such as the Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC), have made saving lives their highest priority by implementing comprehensive testing and tracking, which allowed for the early detection, isolation, and treatment of patients while minimizing widespread mobility restrictions. As a result of the cooperation between government agencies and the wider public, the number of confirmed cases slowed down to an average of less than 10 per day in May, compared with more than 500 new cases per day in late February and early March. During the COVID-19 crisis, the Korean government&#x02019;s rapid response to the epidemic resulted in the substantial improvement of the national scientific research ability and research equipment through the integration of scientific research resources, increase in research investment, strengthening of direct cooperation between international and domestic scientists, and acceleration of the clinical applications of scientific research results [<xref rid="B17-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], thereby enhancing the ability to prevent the spread of the epidemic or accelerate the elimination of the virus [<xref rid="B18-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The Korean government was able to pause and reflect after the peak of the coronavirus crisis started to subside.</p><p>Due to the magnitude of the public funds invested in infectious disease-related research [<xref rid="B14-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the Korean government has to evaluate their investment strategy about which research fields must be invested in and in which research fields is needed collaboration with international partners to reach important research goals [<xref rid="B13-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To date, few studies have provided a comprehensive analysis of infectious disease R&#x00026;D from a public funding perspective [<xref rid="B13-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study to satisfy both prerequisites for understanding what coronavirus disease-related research and development has been conducted from both the world&#x02019;s and South Korea&#x02019;s perspectives. Therefore, this study aims to provide useful information about the coronavirus disease-related scientific research trends of leading nations and Korea during the 2012&#x02013;2018 time period and then analyze this research to plan further scientific research. Many studies have indicated that the US, EU, and Japan have critical roles in the scientific and technological advancements in infectious diseases [<xref rid="B14-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B19-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In particular, as the four leading national scientific funding organizations or programs related to the health domain in the world, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the US; the framework programs for research and innovation (i.e., Horizon 2020) funded by the EU; and the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) program of the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of the Japanese government are significant [<xref rid="B21-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, the data from government-funded projects were gathered from searchable, open, project-based information databases such as STAR METRICS, CORDIS (Community Research &#x00026; Development Information Service, Brussels, Belgium), and KAKEN (Database of Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Shizuoka, Japan), respectively, that are available for individual or multiple institutions in those places. Besides, the official centralized national R&#x00026;D database called the National Science &#x00026; Technology Information Service (NTIS)&#x02014;which has gathered, managed, and provided all Korean government-funded research information since 2004 (<uri xlink:href="www.ntis.go.kr">www.ntis.go.kr</uri>)&#x02014;was utilized. This paper aims to apply machine learning methodologies and network analysis to understand how the US, EU, and Japan have invested their funding to determine what coronavirus disease-related research fields already exist and match those to the Korean projects with designated research fields stemming from leading nations&#x02019; data analysis.

Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-healthcare-08-00204"><title>2.1. Data Collection</title><p>The data used in this study are national-funded R&#x00026;D project information and were collected from the global R&#x00026;D database provided by STAR METRICS of the US, CORDIS of the EU, and KAKEN of Japan. The global R&#x00026;D database was built and is operated by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) internally, funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT of Korea. It has data from approximately 1 million nationally funded projects between 2012 and 2018. The detailed process of database establishment is described in [<xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The data from Korea were collected from NTIS, which is utilized in many studies of Korean R&#x00026;D trends [<xref rid="B23-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A total of 599 and 638 nationally funded R&#x00026;D projects related to coronaviruses between 2012 and 2018 were collected from the developed nations (the US, EU countries, and Japan) and Korea with these query sets in <xref rid="healthcare-08-00204-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-healthcare-08-00204"><title>2.2. Data Pre-Processing for Further Analysis</title><p>None of the national R&#x00026;D databases provide the complete information of all nationally funded projects. For example, suppose that a five-year nationally funded scientific project was started in June 2015. STAR-METRICS and NTIS contained funding information for some fiscal years, which did not allow us to estimate the total amount of funds for multi-year projects. Thus, calculations were estimated by multiplying the average funding amount per year that was extrapolated based on the title of these projects in the global R&#x00026;D database and the total period (year) of these projects. After that, we removed some data that included the number of funded projects that were zero and kept some data by adding the organization names as found through manual searches for these projects from other data sources. <xref rid="healthcare-08-00204-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows a total of 273 and 170 nationally funded R&#x00026;D projects related to coronaviruses utilized for further analysis, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-healthcare-08-00204"><title>2.3. Clustering Through Co-Occurrence Matrix</title><p>As a way of identifying coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D areas, the co-occurrence matrix was made in terms of the ASJC code (All Science Journal Classification Codes) of Scopus by using the Vantage Point<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> system (Search Technology, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) as demonstrated in [<xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. From the single standard&#x02019;s perspective, the ASJC code was previously assigned to all the projects in the global R&#x00026;D database that employed the machine learning approach to classify the different R&#x00026;D projects that stemmed from the US, the EU, and Japan [<xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The number of data utilized by Korea, which has the characteristics of the centralized database, was as high as that used by the US. It may cause a &#x0201c;home advantage&#x0201d; bias [<xref rid="B26-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, the data of Korea excluded the making of a co-occurrence matrix.</p><p>Identifying the association among ASJC codes through the co-occurrence matrix implied a network structure. Thus, the VOSViewer (Leiden University, Gravenhage, the Netherlands) software was used as a network structure visualization tool to understand the relationship between ASJC codes [<xref rid="B15-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The VOSViewer system calculates the similarity between each component and visualizes the network structure in the form of a cluster map or a topographic map [<xref rid="B28-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A mathematical model and algorithm of VOSviewer&#x02019;s clustering and mapping can be found in Van Eck and Waltman [<xref rid="B29-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Sub-Clustering and Definitions of (Sub-)Clusters</title><p>The constructed clusters were initially subdivided into more detailed sub-clusters. Therefore, in order to derive more coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D areas from more massive clusters, each larger cluster was divided into several sub-clusters. After that, the definitions of coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D areas were determined by directly and carefully reviewing R&#x00026;D projects comprised of clusters or sub-clusters.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-healthcare-08-00204"><title>2.5.

Thus, all of the projects that were excluded from each (sub-)cluster were accorded with each (sub-)cluster or removed if they did not belong to any cluster according to experts. We sought to draw out the significant implications for the directions of the coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D planning of Korea through the comparisons between the nations.

Comparison between the Developed Nations and Korea</title><p>Due to the differences in the absolute amount of R&#x00026;D funding per nation, ratio analysis was undertaken to compare the relative magnitudes of these coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D areas among nations, which allowed for the identification of these nations&#x02019; strengths and weaknesses [<xref rid="B32-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The US has a wide range of research fields for infectious disease preparedness ranging from basic research (i.e., the identification and mechanism of the viral pathogen) (62.0%) to animal&#x02013;environmental ecology and the epidemiologic investigation and quarantine of infectious diseases (23.8%) and has invested from a mid- to long-term perspective (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="healthcare-08-00204-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Although the funding scale for coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D areas in the EU and Japan is smaller than that of the United States, the directions for the R&#x00026;D areas are considerably analogous to those in the US. These trends in coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D funding show that the directions for the R&#x00026;D investment are in accordance with the &#x0201c;One Health&#x0201d; concept of the WHO, which is a global strategy for all aspects of healthcare for the environment&#x02013;animal&#x02013;human paradigm [<xref rid="B33-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The Korean government has invested in coronavirus-related basic research and core technologies (Sub-Cluster 1-1: 4.4%, Sub-Cluster 1-2: 45.4%, and Sub-Cluster 1-3: 29.3%), including the identification of infectious disease pathogens, the structure and replication mechanism of viruses, infection mechanisms in the host, and immune responses, which are dominated by the US and EU&#x02019;s technological edge. However, some coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D areas were heavily supported by the Korean government compared to the US. These R&#x00026;D areas covered research related to the platform for the immunological response to viral infections and for vaccine development (Sub-Cluster 1-2: Korea: 45.4% vs. the US: 26.3%), the platform for detection and point-of-care diagnostics (Sub-Cluster 1-3: Korea: 29.3% vs. the US: 6.1%), and the studies on the design of antiviral agents based on the structure and function of viral and human receptor proteins (Sub-Cluster 2-2: Korea: 14.3% vs. the US: 13.6%), which are not only highly applied in clinical settings in practice but also have high possibilities for technological commercialization from a short- or medium-term perspective (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="healthcare-08-00204-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The characteristics of Korea&#x02019;s R&#x00026;D funding may be due to the combined needs of the profit sector, which has emphasized short- or medium-term returns on investment, and the bio-industry promotion policy of the Korean government to strengthen the private sector&#x02019;s technological advantage. Moreover, it is reasonable to deduce that the government-driven R&#x00026;D on viruses after the spread of MERS-CoV in 2015 also had a profound impact on expenditures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-healthcare-08-00204"><title>4. Discussion </title><p>This study aimed to elucidate the trends of coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D&#x02014;because COVID-19 has been globally endangering human health and well-being since December 2019 and, at the moment, the spread of COVID-19 has barely been controlled in Korea&#x02014;thereby deriving directions for government-driven R&#x00026;D to prepare for the post-corona pandemic era. Three coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D areas were clustered through co-occurrence matrix analysis, and then, on the subjects of two of them, five sub-clusters were additionally extrapolated based on experts&#x02019; reviews. According to the results, the US, the EU, and Japan have invested in coronavirus-related research areas through 160 projects worth 1,099,242,389 USD, nine projects worth 44,637,157 USD, and 46 projects worth 6,183,689 USD, respectively. Meanwhile, Korea has funded 170 projects worth about 81,559,215 USD. Due to the centralized database of Korea, its coronavirus-related R&#x00026;D activities may be overestimated. Despite this limitation, we found that developed nations focused their propensity on investing in entire research areas. On the other hand, due to the outbreak of MERS-CoV in 2015, Korea is likely to continue pursuing technological commercialization to strengthen its bio-industry competitiveness in some specific areas rather than basic research areas from a short-and medium-term viewpoint.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-healthcare-08-00204"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This result has three profound implications for Korea. Firstly, the coronavirus crisis has affected the healthcare systems of Korea locally and has driven many countries around the world to their breaking points, thereby making it clear that the international collaboration of the entire R&#x00026;D network must remain a priority. Thus, the Korean government must confront the deficiency of their capabilities in core technology areas rather than the &#x0201c;K-quarantine&#x0201d; model, which was emphasized as an asset to support economic cooperation, to pioneer new markets, and to bolster the nation&#x02019;s reputation in the international community [<xref rid="B34-healthcare-08-00204" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Secondly, it is useful for Korea to establish long-term strategies such as international cooperation programs in human resource exchange and bilateral/multilateral R&#x00026;D activities among the leading organizations. In particular, it is necessary to develop the infectious disease-related basic research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics where Korea&#x02019;s technology is insufficient. Finally, basic information on the amount of R&#x00026;D funding and research organizations in leading nations may allow stakeholders in these nations to consider the future directions for establishing R&#x00026;D investments and policies in the post-corona crisis era. National funding data-based analysis could only provide financial information, which was impossible to deduce when a scientific publication- or patent-based analysis was undertaken.</p><p>As the coronavirus crisis has had devastating impacts on all social and economic sectors around the world, there is a strong need for the adequate global detection and an adequate response to the identification of new variants, including new epidemic variants or new variants with pandemic potential, by enhancing globally collaborative efforts in scientific societies. It is necessary to investigate the status quo of the R&#x00026;D of global infectious diseases in order to improve global cooperation strategies, with more effective organizational support through funding the R&#x00026;D of technologies that deal with infectious diseases. Further study is needed on the analysis of R&#x00026;D funding in virology, recognized as a basic research area for battling against infectious diseases more effectively, and its associated disciplines to strengthen the capacity of global infectious disease surveillance. It may provide useful insights for strategic approaches to an international collaboration network, thereby enhancing the assessment of international cooperative research projects and improving the capacity for a global response to infectious disease threats.</p><p>As aforementioned, the US, the EU, and Japan&#x02019;s data sources did not include information on the entire funding data of these nations. However, Korea&#x02019;s NTIS contains a centralized database for the entire data of national funding, thereby creating a &#x0201c;home advantage&#x0201d; bias. Moreover, the limitation of this study was that it was focused narrowly on coronavirus-related national funded projects. Thus, the data that were retrieved could not cover the study of other serious infectious diseases such as Zika, Ebola, and Nipah Virus.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-healthcare-08-00204"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/8/3/204/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/8/3/204/s1</uri>.
