Secondly, it is useful for Korea to establish long-term strategies such as international cooperation programs in human resource exchange and bilateral/multilateral R&amp;D activities among the leading organizations. In particular, it is necessary to develop the infectious disease-related basic research, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics where Korea’s technology is insufficient. Finally, basic information on the amount of R&amp;D funding and research organizations in leading nations may allow stakeholders in these nations to consider the future directions for establishing R&amp;D investments and policies in the post-corona crisis era. National funding data-based analysis could only provide financial information, which was impossible to deduce when a scientific publication- or patent-based analysis was undertaken.
