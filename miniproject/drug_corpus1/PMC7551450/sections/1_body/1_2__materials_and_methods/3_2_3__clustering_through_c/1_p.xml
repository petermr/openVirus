<p>As a way of identifying coronavirus-related R&amp;D areas, the co-occurrence matrix was made in terms of the ASJC code (All Science Journal Classification Codes) of Scopus by using the Vantage Point
 <sup>®</sup> system (Search Technology, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) as demonstrated in [

From the single standard’s perspective, the ASJC code was previously assigned to all the projects in the global R&amp;D database that employed the machine learning approach to classify the different R&amp;D projects that stemmed from the US, the EU, and Japan [
