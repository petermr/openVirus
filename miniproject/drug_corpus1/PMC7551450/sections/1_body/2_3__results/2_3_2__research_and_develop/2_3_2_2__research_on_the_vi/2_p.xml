<p>Firstly, structure–activity relationship modeling-based virus prediction and activity modulation in Korea (Sub-Cluster 2-1) is composed of seven projects, worth 2,775,533 USD. The Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology has committed to funding a project entitled “Development of viral recombination prediction and validation technique using bioinformatics” with projected expenditures of 272,727 USD, which started in 2014 and is projected to finish in 2022. Yonsei University’s “Basic research on new drug candidate discovery based on chemo-informatics” project spent 890,909 USD between 2006 and 2009. Meanwhile, Kyungdon University’s project, “Big-data analysis on viral infection using epigenetic information”, spent 144,475 USD between 2016 and 2019 (see
