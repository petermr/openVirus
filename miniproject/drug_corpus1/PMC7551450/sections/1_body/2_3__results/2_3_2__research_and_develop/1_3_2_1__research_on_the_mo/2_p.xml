<p>Firstly, research related to the mechanisms of infection, the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and the identification of a virus–host interaction mechanism in Korea (Sub-Cluster 1-1) consisted of 34 projects, totaling 4,351,252 USD. Kookmin University’s project, “Reaction mechanism study on SARS Coronavirus helicase and its applications to develop the inhibitors” spent 137,209 USD between 2013 and 2016. Chonbuk National University and Chungnam National University have participated in the same research areas. Chonbuk National University’s “A genetic characteristic study for zoonotic potential of several pathogens from bats in Korea” has expected expenditures 45,455 USD. The study began in 2018 and will end in 2021. Chungnam National University’s project, “Identification of the mechanism of coronavirus cross-species transmission and pathogenesis mediated by host proteases” has expected expenditures of 136,364 USD between 2020 and 2023 (see
