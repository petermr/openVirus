<p>The Korean government has invested in coronavirus-related basic research and core technologies (Sub-Cluster 1-1: 4.4%, Sub-Cluster 1-2: 45.4%, and Sub-Cluster 1-3: 29.3%), including the identification of infectious disease pathogens, the structure and replication mechanism of viruses, infection mechanisms in the host, and immune responses, which are dominated by the US and EU’s technological edge. However, some coronavirus-related R&amp;D areas were heavily supported by the Korean government compared to the US. These R&amp;D areas covered research related to the platform for the immunological response to viral infections and for vaccine development (Sub-Cluster 1-2: Korea: 45.4% vs. the US: 26.3%), the platform for detection and point-of-care diagnostics (Sub-Cluster 1-3: Korea: 29.3% vs. the US: 6.1%), and the studies on the design of antiviral agents based on the structure and function of viral and human receptor proteins (Sub-Cluster 2-2: Korea: 14.3% vs. the US: 13.6%), which are not only highly applied in clinical settings in practice but also have high possibilities for technological commercialization from a short- or medium-term perspective (see

The characteristics of Korea’s R&amp;D funding may be due to the combined needs of the profit sector, which has emphasized short- or medium-term returns on investment, and the bio-industry promotion policy of the Korean government to strengthen the private sector’s technological advantage. Moreover, it is reasonable to deduce that the government-driven R&amp;D on viruses after the spread of MERS-CoV in 2015 also had a profound impact on expenditures.
