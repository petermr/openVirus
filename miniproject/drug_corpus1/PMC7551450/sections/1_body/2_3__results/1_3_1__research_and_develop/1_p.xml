<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="healthcare-08-00204-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the scientific research fields of the coronavirus-related national funded projects in the US, the EU, and Japan may be divided into three clusters (categories). After reviewing the research descriptions of the funded projects, distinct subjects in significant clusters such as Cluster 1 and 2 were deduced by experts and named to include the core meanings of the individual research fields as follows: (Cluster 1) research on the molecular characteristics of infectious viruses and the interaction mechanisms of viral pathogens and human hosts, including the immune response, for developing diagnostics, therapeutics, and a vaccine against COVID-19; (Sub-Cluster 1-1) research related to the mechanisms of infection, the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and the identification of a virus–host interaction mechanism; (Sub-Cluster 1-2) research related to the platform for the immunological response to viral infection and for vaccine development; (Sub-Cluster 1-3) the platform for detection and point-of-care diagnostics; (Cluster 2) research on the virus protein structure-active/function-based antivirus therapeutics (treatment) design and active/resistance modulation research on the virus protein structure-active/function-based antivirus therapeutics (treatment) design and active/resistance modulation; (Sub-Cluster 2-1) structure–activity relationship modeling-based virus prediction and activity modulation; (Sub-Cluster 2-2) studies on the design of antiviral agents based on the structure and function of viral and human receptor proteins; and (Cluster 3) infectious disease epidemiological investigation and animal and environmental ecology (all of the national funded projects in each (sub-)cluster are provided in the
