 <p>In the middle of a pandemic, patients with cough and fever are thought to have SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2). It should be remembered that in the desert southwest of the United States, we have an ongoing epidemic of coccidioidomycosis (CM). There are additionally many other respiratory illnesses that could be confused with CoV-2 or overlooked. This is a case report of CoV-2 engrafted on chronic cavitary pulmonary CM. In a time where the coronavirus pandemic is becoming rampant, we demonstrate the case of a coinfection with cavitary pulmonary CM. In this case, the importance of detection of the coronavirus and treatment of the coinfection is explored.</p>
