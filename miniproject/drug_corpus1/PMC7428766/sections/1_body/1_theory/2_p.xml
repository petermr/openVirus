<p id="par0030">The transmission of AURIs in humans is generally believed to occur in three ways: 1) inhalation of liquid droplets containing the virus; 2) close contact with infected persons; and 3) contact with surfaces contaminated with respiratory viruses. Moreover, aerosol transmission has been known to play an important role within enclosed spaces. Many traditional AURIs, such as influenza and tuberculosis, as well as many emerging infectious diseases are spread by the airborne route. A retrospective cohort study conducted in Hong Kong in 2003 suggested that aerosol transmission may have been an important transmission route during the SARS epidemic (

Other studies reported that MERS-CoV infection may have been airborne (o, Zhang, Ma, &amp; Zhou, 2020; Ergenekon, Mustafa, &amp; Vedat, 2014). Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly, aerosol transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has come into focus. WHO health officials stated that there is still insufficient evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the air, except in certain medical settings such as during intubation. To date, some studies have reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the air in isolation rooms from hospitals treating COVID-19 patients (Yuanfang J, 2020;

 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Liu, 2020</xref>), but other similar studies in Singapore and Hong Kong have failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 particles in the air (

 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Ong et al., 2020</xref>). Additional retrospective studies conducted as the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic progressed demonstrated that airborne transmission was one of the most likely mechanisms explaining the spatial pattern of infections. This contention has been highlighted in an open letter signed by 239 scientists from 32 countries that was featured in the Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases on July 6. Three days later, the WHO published a scientific brief on the web and said that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by the aerosol route has not been demonstrated, and much more research is needed. Therefore, it is crucial to find more evidence to confirm whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the air.
