<p id="par0035">Although all patients in the previous studies had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had COVID-19, little attention has been paid to the follow-up of recovered patients. There have been some reported cases of patients who recovered from COVID-19 but tested positive again a few days later, even though they were quarantined after being discharge, and the re-detectable positive (RP) rate was 14.5% (
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Lan, 2020</xref>). The reason for this observation remains unclear, and it is uncertain whether RP patients could cause new infections after being discharged. However, even though the pandemic has been largely controlled in several countries such as China and South Korea, RP patients may increase the risk of infection in cities because there are a growing number of patients who tested negative and were then discharged. In addition, there is no environmental evidence confirming whether recovered patients are still shedding SARS-CoV-2 particles; therefore, urgent investigations are needed because it could be one of the reasons for the observed RP patients. Therefore, our study aims to 1) determine whether SARS-CoV-2 particles are present in the indoor air, with an objective to test the hypothesis of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and 2) determine whether recovered patients are still shedding SARS-CoV-2 particles, thus providing much-needed environmental evidence for the management of COVID-19 patients during the recovery period.
