<p id="par0025">Acute upper respiratory infection (AURI) is one of the most widespread infections among humans. Respiratory viruses are a common cause of AURI, which is responsible for approximately 200 million cases of pneumonia worldwide annually (

 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Sande, Njunge, Ngoi, Mutunga, &amp; Pollard, 2019</xref>). The common cold is the most widespread AURI caused by a virus (
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>); other viruses that cause AURI include influenza A, measles, rubella, etc. AURIs are a significant public health problem and a source of increased socioeconomic burden worldwide, as evident by the serious global public health crises caused by multiple AURI pandemics during the course of human history. One hundred two years ago, the first wave of the Spanish influenza (Spanish flu) pandemic occurred in the spring and summer of 1918. Thereafter, a serious epidemic occurred from September through December, spreading widely from France across the globe, thus causing the second pandemic wave. The following year, the Spanish flu spread from Eurasia to Oceania, New Zealand, and Australia, constituting the third wave (

 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Lamb, 2001</xref>). The morbidity rate was 20% to 40%; the death toll approximately 20 to 50 million; and the mortality rate was 2.5% to 5%, far exceeding the number of deaths that occurred during the First World War (Taubenberger &amp; Morens, 2006). Another AURI pandemic was severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which occurred in Guangdong, China, in 2002. It first spread to Southeast Asia and then across the globe (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">China, 2003</xref>). The SARS pandemic was not eliminated until mid-2003. According to statistics released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in July 2003, there were 8,098 cases of SARS worldwide, involving 32 countries and regions. The global death toll due to SARS was 774, with a case fatality rate of nearly 11% (
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Department Of Communicable Disease, 2004</xref>). SARS also caused the collapse of patient care services in health care systems due to staff shortages. Since medical and nursing staff were infected with SARS, hospital intensive care units (ICUs) could not be run safely, forcing emergency departments to close down (Caulford,2004;Ahmad,2003;Parry,2003). This was followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak that occurred in Saudi Arabia in July 2012. According to statistics from the WHO, there were 2,494 cases of MERS worldwide from September 2012 to November 2019, involving 24 countries and regions (
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2019</xref>). The global death toll due to MERS was 858, with a case fatality rate of 34.4%, which was even higher than that for SARS (WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013; Assiri et al., 2013). Since AURIs are a serious threat to the health of the world's population and are a large significant obstacle to achieve the goal of building healthy cities via the WHO Healthy Cities Project (
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">TSOUROS, 1995</xref>), strengthening preventive and control measures for AURI diseases is vital to reducing the global socioeconomic burden and improving human health globally, paving the way towards building healthy and smart cities.
