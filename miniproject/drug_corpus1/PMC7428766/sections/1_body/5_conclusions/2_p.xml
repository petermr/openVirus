<p id="par0095">Our findings revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the indoor air of the ICU and indicate that the virus may be shed via aerosol for days, even after a patient has tested negative. This finding may be one of the reasons for the observation of RP patients. This finding provides valuable empirical information and environmental evidence for the effective management of COVID-19 patients during the convalescent period. We suggest that it is necessary to extend the detection time for COVID-19 patients at the time of discharge and to continually monitor the air surrounding recovered COVID-19 patients for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the frequency of indoor air disinfection needs to be increased, and the indoor relative humidity should be kept at a high level. Our findings can be used to improve both routine cleaning during the outbreak and clinical and disease management guidelines for discharged COVID-19 patients.</p>
