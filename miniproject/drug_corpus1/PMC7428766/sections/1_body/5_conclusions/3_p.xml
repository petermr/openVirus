<p id="par0100">Since ICUs are required to maintain negative pressure, close off the isolation ward, and isolate patients in the wards for days at a stretch, it is not possible to use traditional architectural design measures to reduce airborne virus concentrations such as adequate and effective ventilation and ultraviolet germicidal lamps. Additionally, it is difficult to limit the number and density of patients in ICUs and avoid overcrowding during emergency situations like the early stage of the epidemic in Wuhan. Therefore, to enhance the isolation and care facilities for infectious diseases, smart designs for health and quarantine facilities and ICUs are receiving more attention. Attention should be given to the physical elements and environments of buildings that had been designed to reduce the risk of infectious diseases such as Yersinia pestis, tuberculosis, typhoid, polio, and flu during historical epidemics prior to the development of medicines (

In late 2014, a total of 56 hospitals in the United States of America were designated as specially designed, high-level isolation units (HLIUs) equipped with an advanced infrastructure, advanced laboratory capabilities, and well-trained staff by state governments and federal public health authorities to care for patients with highly hazardous communicable diseases (HHCDs) (

To improve the ability to prevent, treat, and manage viral respiratory infections and prevent future crises similar to COVID-19, we suggest that the following points be considered when designing smart buildings and hospitals in the future: 1) development of new air disinfection equipment with better disinfection efficiency and observable sustained effects; 2) strengthening of the cooperation and communication between scientists belonging to different fields such as environmental engineering, architecture, clinical medicine, and public health to design smarter and more effective ICUs that conform to health and isolation standards; 3) integration of information communication technology with hospital operations; and 4) implementation of the concept of the Internet of Things within smart hospitals in smart cities (
