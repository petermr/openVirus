  <p>Evolutions in molecular testing procedures. The point-of-care test (POCT) devices incorporate nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection together into an integrated and sealed cartridge making it simple, rapid and safe. During end-point PCR, DNA is detected or measured at the completion of PCR amplification, requiring post-PCR processing. Real-time PCR is a closed-tube system in which DNA is detected or measured during the exponential phase of amplification.</p>
