<p>HCoVs are endemic (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) or epidemic (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). In temperate regions endemic HCoVs usually display a winter seasonality, although HCoV-229E has been detected sporadically throughout the year [

Accessed 3 February 2020), less than a year after the first reported case. In contrast, human cases caused by MERS-CoV continue to be reported at the time of writing, more than seven years after the first reported case. Most laboratory-confirmed MERS cases have occurred in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and the majority of those in Saudi Arabia. Unlike the endemic HCoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are maintained in zoonotic reservoirs. The SARS and MERS outbreaks were driven in part by super-spreading events in which individuals directly infected a disproportionally large number of contacts [

Based on genetic relatedness to other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 likely has a zoonotic reservoir. However, the precise source of SARS-CoV-2 that initially infected humans remains to be confirmed. The SARS-CoV-2 appears to be substantially more contagious than SARS-CoV (

An interesting question is the susceptibility of farm animals and pets, and their role in the epidemiologic cycle as their angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor shares similarity with human ACE2 [
