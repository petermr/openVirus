<p>Rapid antigen tests would theoretically provide the advantage of fast time to results and low-cost detection of HCoVs but are likely to suffer from poor sensitivity based on the experience with this method for influenza (Flu) viruses [

Accessed 15 March 2020). The incorporation of colloidal gold-labeled immunoglobulin G (IgG) as the detection reagent is an approach that may increase the sensitivity of rapid antigen tests for respiratory viruses [

 <span class="sans-serif" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">.</span> Monoclonal antibodies specifically against SARS-CoV-2 have been under preparation. Novel approaches to concentrate antigen, or to amplify the detection phase are needed if these methods are to have clinical utility. Sona Nanotech (Halifax, Canada) is developing a quick-response lateral-flow test to screen COVID-19 patients targeting to produce results in 5–15 min (
