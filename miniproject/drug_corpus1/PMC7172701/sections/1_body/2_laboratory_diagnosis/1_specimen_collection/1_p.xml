<p>It must be appreciated that no matter how accurate and fast laboratory testing methods are, the diagnosis of viral pneumonias such as caused by SARS-CoV-2 involves collecting the correct specimen from the patient at the right time. The endemic HCoVs have been detected from a variety of upper and lower respiratory sources including throat, nasal nasopharyngeal (NP), sputum, and bronchial fluid [

Accessed 16 March 2020). Swab specimens should be placed in a universal or viral transport medium. Nasopharyngeal aspirates are also suitable specimens for the detection of HCoVs.
