 <p>The world is confronting a dire situation due to the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (SARS‐CoV‐2) with the mortality rate passed over 470,000. Attaining efficient drugs evolve in parallel to the understanding of the SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogenesis. The current drugs in the pipeline and some plausible drugs are overviewed in this paper. Although different types of anti‐viral targets are applicable for SARS‐CoV‐2 drug screenings, the more promising targets can be considered as 3C‐like main protease (3Cl protease) and RNA polymerase. The remdesivir could be considered the closest bifunctional drug to the provisional clinical administration for SARS‐CoV‐2. The known molecular targets of the SARS‐CoV‐2 include fourteen targets, while four molecules of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cathepsin L, 3Cl protease and RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are suggested as more promising potential targets. Accordingly, dual‐acting drugs as an encouraging solution in drug discovery are suggested. Emphasizing the potential route of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and virus entry‐related factors like integrins, cathepsin and ACE2 seems valuable. The potential molecular targets of each phase of the SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle are discussed and highlighted in this paper. Much progress in understanding the SARS‐CoV‐2 and molecular details of its life cycle followed by the identification of new therapeutic targets are needed to lead us to an efficient approach in anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 drug discovery.</p>
