 <p>The novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading around the world. Since the public announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak, several concerns have been raised by dermatologists as well as pemphigus patients who take immunosuppressive drugs. In this paper, we review the literature about the common treatment of pemphigus with a focus on the lessons from similar epidemics to find a proper suggestion to manage pemphigus in the COVID-19 pandemic era. The effect of many of the drugs used for treatment of Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) on COVID-19 is not clear. We also do not have data on the impact of this autoimmune disease, which may involve the mucous membranes, on the acquisition or course of COVID-19. We are currently in the midst of a pandemic and evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on the population of susceptible patients suffering from auto-immune diseases like pemphigus is essential. The evidence on best ways to manage patients with underlying conditions, such as pemphigus, during the outbreak of COVID-19 is evolving and the data is updated every day. </p>
