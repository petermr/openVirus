 <p>In December 2019, an outbreak of severe pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China. Later described as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), this infection caused by a virus from the Coronaviridae family (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally. Effective therapies for this new disease are urgently needed. In this short communication, we will evaluate the use of corticosteroids as an adjunctive pharmacological therapy in the management of COVID-19 and describe its pros and cons in light of the latest available evidence.</p>
