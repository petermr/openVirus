<p>Chinese SARS‐CoV‐2 isolates are so similar in their genome sequence that a single introduction event must be considered. Whether this introduction comes directly from an animal source is less clear. SARS‐CoV‐2 is separated from its closest relative, a bat virus sharing 96% sequence identity, by 20 years of sequence evolution. A coronavirus was also isolated from the lungs of two diseased pangolins, sharing up to 92% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS‐CoV‐2, but with a better binding to the human ACE‐2 virus receptor than the bat virus (Lam

Environmental samples from the wet market in Wuhan, where the epidemic originated, identified a virus closely related to the isolates from patients. Such a virus might have circulated as a ‘cryptic’ infection for years in the human population before acquiring a critical mutation that started the current pandemic (Zhang and Holmes,
