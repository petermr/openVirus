<p id="Par12">The 1968 influenza A virus of H3N2 subtype, with the especial feature of antigenic drift, consisted of two genes from an avian influenza A virus: a new H3 hemagglutinin (HA), and the N2 neuraminidase (NA) from the 1957 H2N2 subtype [

As stated earlier, the estimated number of deaths was approximately 1 million worldwide with higher death rate among the elderly people (those who were aged 65 on an average). It has been reported that the neuraminidase (NA)-specific immunity provides protection against influenza, and antibodies against HA and NA are likely to fortify the protection [

Like HA, NA may achieve point mutations during the passage of the viruses within the host, which in turn results in the alteration in the viral antigenicity; i.e., the antigenic drift which is very likely to reduce NA-antibody-based protection against the viral infection as revealed from the in vivo studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is to be noted that the World Health Organization (WHO) selects the influenza candidate vaccine strains based only on the HA antigenicity and not that of NA. Thus the continued surveillance of the NA of circulating influenza viruses and the subsequent of NA antigenicity to optimize the influenza vaccines has been suggested [
