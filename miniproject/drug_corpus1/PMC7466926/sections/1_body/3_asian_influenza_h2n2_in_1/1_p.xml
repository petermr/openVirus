<p id="Par9">The H2N2 subtype influenza A virus (consisting of the genes from an H2N2 subtype encoding H2 hemagglutinin and N2 neuraminidase) that originated from an avian influenza A virus emerged in East Asia, which triggered another pandemic outbreak known as Asian Flu [

However, according to Chowell and clleagues (in 2017), the first local outbreak originated in continental China during February‐March 1957, and then the virus reached Hong Kong and other parts of Asia within a few weeks; and within July of that year, the pandemic reached Europe and South American countries of the Pacific coast, New Zealand, and South Africa. In the USA, the sporadic outbreaks were reported during June‐August 1957 [

Moreover, the mortality burden of the 1957 influenza pandemic in 39 countries was assessed with the WHO associated adequate data since such pandemic appeared as the second one of this century after the Spanish flue which had no mathematical measurement of morbidity and mortality except the gross calculations of death cases [
