Such a puzzle was nearly resolved through the analysis of the archival records of the Cleveland Family Study before and during the 1957 pandemic; i.e., during the shift from subtype H1N1 to H2N2 to investigate the development of the heterosubtypic immunity. The study revealed that only 5.6% of the adults having symptomatic influenza A, developed the infection earlier during the pandemic, despite living in households with participants who had influenza; whereas the infection frequency was much higher (55.2%) in the children having the symptomatic influenza A. This finding clearly showed the accumulation of the heterosubtypic immunity during a pandemic which may draw sufficient attention for the development of vaccines [
