<p id="Par2">Disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics (like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or the SARS-CoV-2; and the Spanish influenza H1N1 in 1918–1920) are very well known terms for the epidemiologists as well as for the other health professionals [

A disease outbreak, both regional and seasonal, is known to take place when a disease propagates into a relatively large numbers of people within a community to several countries, lasting from days to years. In contrast to an outbreak, an epidemic is known to occur when an infectious disease tends to spread more quickly among a huge number of populations, as can be exemplified by the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, causing 774 deaths worldwide [

A pandemic is simply known as global disease like the Spanish influenza H1N1 (causing around 50 million people in 1918–1920), Hong Kong influenza H3N2, causing approximately 1 million people in 1968, Asian influenza H2N2 (causing nearly 2 million deaths in 1957–1958), or the Russian influenza H2N2 (causing more than 1 million deaths in 1889–1892) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. COVID-19 is already well known as the life threatening infectious respiratory disease which actually shares the same routes and means of transmission as influenza; and hence influenza can be correlated with COVID-19 disease which has been further confirmed by the case of a patient co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, measures taken for the influenza (and other infectious respiratory diseases) prevention and control may also serve effectively to combat the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The influenza pandemic is of significant public health importance since it is frequent with the rise of a new subtype of a virus which in turn weakens or escapes the host immunity completely [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, the virus is easily transmissible from human to human through the daily unhygienic activities like irresponsible and close contact coughing and sneezing [
