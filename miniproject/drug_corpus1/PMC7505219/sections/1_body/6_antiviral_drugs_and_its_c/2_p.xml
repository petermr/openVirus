<p id="Par46">Two different classes of antiviral drugs such as M2 ion channel protein inhibitors (rimantadine and amantadine) and NA inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) are currently approved for use against both influenza A and B virus infections. In addition, NA inhibitor drugs inhibit the release of new viral particles from affected cells and mitigate cell-to-cell infection, while amantadine and rimantadine block the transport of H + ions through the viral M2 protein channel that is essential for their entry into the target cell. Traditionally, both drug groups are very effective in managing and preventing seasonal influenza A. Among these, amantadine is recommended for adults only [
