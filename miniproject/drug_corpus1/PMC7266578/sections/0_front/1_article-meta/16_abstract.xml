 <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major pandemic and now a leading cause of death worldwide. Currently, no drugs/vaccine is available for the treatment of this disease. Future preventions and social distancing are the only ways to prevent this disease from community transmission. Vitamin D is an important micronutrient and has been reported to improve immunity and protect against respiratory illness. This short review highlights the important scientific link between Vitamin D levels and susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients. This review also discusses recommendations for Vitamin D dose required for healthy as well as COVID-19 susceptible patients for protection and prevention.</p>
