<p>Persons with COVID-19 may exhibit a broad range of symptoms, beginning with those who are asymptomatic and extending to patients who develop full-blown severe respiratory distress syndrome. Nonspecific constitutional symptoms include fatigue, myalgias, chills, and headaches. Most patients experience symptoms for 1 to 2 weeks with complete resolution, although some require hospitalization. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is on the order of 1% according to estimates published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

 </sup> Whether patients with CP are more susceptible to viral infection or the consequences thereof is unknown. Theoretically, the diminished immune response system observed in CP patients could be even further suppressed by factors such as depression, poor sleep, and opioid use, with potential to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV2.
