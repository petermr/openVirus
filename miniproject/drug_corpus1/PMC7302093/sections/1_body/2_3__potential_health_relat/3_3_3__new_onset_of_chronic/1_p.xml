<p>It is not currently known whether COVID-19 will cause an increase in new-onset CP for the population at large. Risk factors for the longitudinal development of CP have been well studied in fibromyalgia and temporomandibular disorders.

 </sup> Although CP conditions are thought by some to be highly related to stress and distress, studies have consistently shown that high baseline levels of psychological distress are only modestly related to the development of chronic regional or widespread pain (OR 1.5-2).

 </sup> Regional CP, female sex, and low socioeconomic status are the strongest predictors for the subsequent development of widespread pain.

 </sup> Other factors that may contribute to an increase in CP are poor sleep and reduced physical activity. Sleep deprivation can lead to symptoms virtually indistinguishable from widespread pain, fatigue, and diffuse tenderness.

 </sup> Furthermore, the effects of sleep deprivation may be attenuated by physical activity (ie, individuals who remain physically active may be less sensitive to the effects of sleep disruption).

 </sup> Healthcare workers may be at increased risk for development of CP. In a recent Israeli study, 9.7% of a cohort of 206 nurses fulfilled criteria for fibromyalgia, with symptoms strongly correlated with work-related stress and PTSD-related symptoms.
