<p>In this unprecedented crisis, the immediate healthcare concerns are directed towards containment and acute patient care. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health will likely be manifested in both infected individuals and in people spared infection, but are nevertheless adversely affected by disruptions in normal life and experience a wide array of physical, psychological, and social stressors. Based on past experience, we postulate that these scenarios may collectively lead to an increase in CP in the immediate and possibly long-term future. Amidst many uncertainties, the research community is urged to study, devise, and implement strategies aimed at mitigating the pain-related health consequences of this pandemic. Some suggestions could include the establishment of registries of infected patients (including those with concomitant CP), designated COVID-19-related clinics to ensure new and follow-up care for infected persons, examination of telehealth as a means of delivering health care, and population surveys to gather public health information related to COVID-19. Epidemiological data should be used to inform future healthcare policies that seek to reduce the magnitude of future epidemics and their myriad consequences on CP and other diseases. The timely recognition of new CP or exacerbations of preexisting CP, prompt and targeted treatment, and strategies to mitigate the potential impact on health are strongly encouraged.</p>
