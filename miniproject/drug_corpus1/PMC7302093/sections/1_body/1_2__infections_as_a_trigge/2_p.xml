<p>Although some infections cause specific postinfectious syndromes, there is also a common stereotypical response to any type of infection that is often observed. For example, up to 12% of patients infected with 3 different pathogens, ie, 
 <italic>Ross River virus</italic> (the cause of epidemic polyarthritis), 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> (cause of Q fever), and Epstein–Barr virus, experienced a postviral syndrome of pain, fatigue, and memory difficulties for up to 12 months after infection.

 </sup> Although these infections have markedly disparate acute presentations, a stereotypical chronic syndrome occurred at remarkably similar rates and was not predicted by demographic, psychological/psychiatric measures, or microbiological factors.

 </sup> The presence and severity of somatic symptoms during acute infection was closely correlated with the subsequent development of chronic fatigue and pain.
