 </sup> Outcomes related to these infections are almost always focused on the immediate response to the acute illness, with little attention to long-term outcomes. In a small study of 22 subjects (21 of whom were healthcare workers) infected during the SARS epidemic, a chronic post-SARS syndrome consisting of fatigue, diffuse myalgia, depression, and nonrestorative sleep persisted for almost 2 years.
