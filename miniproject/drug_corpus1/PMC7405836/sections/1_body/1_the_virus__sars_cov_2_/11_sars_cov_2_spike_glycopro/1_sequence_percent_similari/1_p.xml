<p>We assessed the nucleotide percent similarity using the MegAlign software program, where the similarity between the novel SARS-CoV-2 isolates was in the range of 99.4% to 100%. Among the other 
 <italic>Serbecovirus</italic> CoV sequences, the novel SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed the highest similarity to bat-SL-CoV, with nucleotide percent identity ranges between 88.12 and 89.65%. Meanwhile, earlier reported SARS-CoVs showed 70.6 to 74.9% similarity to SARS-CoV-2 at the nucleotide level. Further, the nucleotide percent similarity was 55.4%, 45.5% to 47.9%, 46.2% to 46.6%, and 45.0% to 46.3% to the other four subgenera, namely, 
 <italic>Hibecovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Nobecovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic>, respectively. The percent similarity index of current outbreak isolates indicates a close relationship between SARS-CoV-2 isolates and bat-SL-CoV, indicating a common origin. However, particular pieces of evidence based on further complete genomic analysis of current isolates are necessary to draw any conclusions, although it was ascertained that the current novel SARS-CoV-2 isolates belong to the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> in the diverse range of betacoronaviruses. Their possible ancestor was hypothesized to be from bat CoV strains, wherein bats might have played a crucial role in harboring this class of viruses.
