 <p>2019 – Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCOV), enclosed large genome positive-sense RNA virus characterized by crown-like spikes that protrude from their surface, and have a distinctive replication strategy. The 2019-nCOV belongs to the Coronaviridae family, principally consists of virulent pathogens showing zoonotic property, has emerged as a pandemic outbreak with high mortality and high morbidity rate around the globe and no therapeutic vaccine or drugs against 2019-nCoV are discovered till now. In this study, 
  <italic>in silico</italic> methods and algorithms were used for sequence, structure analysis and molecular docking on M
  <sup>pro</sup> of 2019-nCOV. The co-crystal structure of 2019-nCOV protease, 6LU7 have ∼99% identity with SARS-CoV protease. The 6LU7 residues, Cys145 and His164 are playing a significant role in replication and are essential for the survival of 2019-nCOV. Alongside, 2019-nCOV M
  <sup>pro</sup> sequence is non-homologous to human host-pathogen. Complete genome sequence analysis, structural and molecular docking results revealed that Remdesivir is having a better binding affinity with -8.2
  <bold> </bold>kcal/mol than the rest of protease inhibitors, and peptide. Remdesivir is strongly forming h-bonds with crucial M
  <sup>pro</sup> residues, Cys145, and His164. Further, MD simulation analysis also confirmed, that these residues are forming H-bond with Remdesivir during 100
  <bold> </bold>ns simulations run and found stable (∼99%) by RMSD and RMSF. Thus, present 
  <italic>in silico</italic> study at molecular approaches suggest that, Remdesivir is a potent therapeutic inhibitor against 2019-nCoV.
