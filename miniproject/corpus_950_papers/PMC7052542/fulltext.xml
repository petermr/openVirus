During 2017 and 2018 alone, outbreaks in poultry and wild birds were reported in 17 Asian and African countries, including 8 countries during the first 6 months of 2018, with millions of birds succumbing to the disease or culled to control outbreaks [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Sporadic transmission to humans occurs during poultry outbreaks. Since 2003, 860 human H5N1 infections have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), with nearly two-thirds of cases occurring in Egypt and Indonesia. While the number of reported human infections has declined substantially in recent years despite continued circulation in birds, underreporting due to reduced awareness and limited diagnostic capacity in affected African and Asian countries cannot be excluded.</p><p>The overall mortality related to reported human infections is high (53%), with remarkable differences among countries and regions, ranging from 33% in Egypt to as high as 84% in Indonesia, where fewer than one-quarter of all reported cases but more than one-third of all deaths occurred [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These regional differences in outcome might be related to differences in access to healthcare and clinical management among countries, differences in virulence of circulating viruses, or both. The relatively low mortality in Egypt compared to south and southeast Asian countries, where the case fatality rate is more than twice as high (69%), may, in part, be attributable to earlier identification, hospitalization, and antiviral treatment of patients in Egypt [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the timing of hospitalization and treatment cannot readily explain the mortality differences among Asian countries. For example, despite similarly late treatment of patients in Vietnam and Indonesia (median, 6 days after illness onset), reported mortality in Vietnam is substantially lower (50% in Vietnam vs 84% in Indonesia) [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although genetically distinct H5N1 virus lineages circulate in different regions and countries, insights into possible differences in virulence or other viral characteristics that could impact clinical outcome are very limited. Studies that relate virological determinants to clinical outcome are largely limited to observations in small numbers of Vietnamese and Cambodian patients infected by clade 1 H5N1 viruses. These studies showed that a fatal outcome is associated with high pharyngeal viral loads, the presence of viremia, and a poor response to oseltamivir treatment due to antiviral resistance [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;13</xref>]. Comparable data from patients infected with other H5N1 virus clades may contribute to improved understanding of the differences in mortality but are currently lacking.</p><p>In the present study, we report detailed virological analyses in a range of clinical specimens from 180 Indonesian patients with laboratory-confirmed H5N1 infection, representing the first comprehensively studied series of human clade 2.1 H5N1 infections and the largest cohort of human H5N1 infections overall. In addition to confirming that high nasopharyngeal viral loads are associated with poor clinical outcome, the virus was more commonly detected in blood, and early antiviral responses to treatment with oseltamivir appeared less pronounced when compared to Vietnamese H5N1 clade 1&#x02013;infected patients. Strikingly, the case fatality rate in Indonesia increased over time and was associated with increasing viral loads and the emergence of mutations in the matrix protein that confers adamantane resistance. These observations suggest that differences in virulence and other viral characteristics may contribute to the exceptionally high mortality related to human clade 2.1 H5N1 infections in Indonesia.</p><sec sec-type="materials" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Specimen and Data Collection</title><p>The analyses were conducted on anonymized available specimens and associated demographic and clinical data from Indonesian patients with laboratory-confirmed H5N1 infection during the period 2005&#x02013;2017.

Neither of these substitutions was found in 29 specimens from 14 patients after initiation of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and in specimens from 14 patients with no treatment.</p><p>Sequence analyses of the M2 gene in admission specimens from 153 patients revealed the presence of mutations that confer resistance to adamantanes in 131 (85.6%) patients.

M2 resistance mutations were detected more frequently in fatal cases compared to survivors (117/132 [89%] vs 14/21 [67%], respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .015). Over time, the prevalence of M2 resistance mutations increased gradually from 37.5% in 2005 to 95% in 2009 and to 100% during subsequent years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These increases correlated with increasing median pharyngeal viral RNA loads during the same period (Spearman &#x003c1; = 0.83; <italic>P</italic> = .0019). As a result, admission viral RNA loads in throat specimens from patients who harbored virus with M2 resistance mutations were higher than those from patients infected with virus without these mutations (median, 5.3 log cDNA copies/mL vs 4.3 log cDNA copies/mL; <italic>P</italic> = .0042).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In a large cohort of 180 Indonesian patients with influenza A/H5N1 infection, representing one-fifth of all globally reported cases and 90% of those reported from Indonesia, we provide information to explain the exceptionally high and increasing mortality related to human H5N1 clade 2.1 infections in Indonesia.</p><p>As shown previously in small case series of patients infected with clade 1 H5N1 viruses, viral RNA could be detected in respiratory specimens at high levels for more than 2 weeks after illness onset, indicating prolonged virus replication and shedding during the course of the disease [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;13</xref>]. Furthermore, a fatal outcome was not only associated with higher viral loads in the throat, as has been reported previously, but also in nasal specimens. The limited number of patients investigated in previous series may explain why the latter was not observed before. The detection rates of viral RNA in gastrointestinal specimens and particularly in blood were higher in Indonesian patients than previously reported in Vietnamese H5N1-infected patients (gastrointestinal, 80% vs 71% and blood, 85% vs 56%, respectively) [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It remains unclear whether the detection of viral RNA in these specimens reflects infectious virus since no attempts were made to isolate virus due to sample volume restrictions. However, isolation of infectious virus from feces and blood during human H5N1 infections has previously been reported [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, although numbers of patients in this and previous series were small, it is tempting to speculate that higher rates of viremia in our patients and consequent increased risk of systemic spread of clade 2.1 viruses may have contributed to the higher mortality among Indonesian patients.</p><p>Treatment with oseltamivir was associated with a survival benefit. This benefit was greater when treatment was started earlier in the course of infection, confirming earlier observations and emphasizing the need for early recognition and diagnosis [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although differences in survival among countries may be difficult to interpret in view of possible differences in healthcare access and medical practices among H5N1-affected regions, reported survival in oseltamivir-treated patients infected by clade 1 H5N1 viruses is substantially higher than in our clade 2.1-infected patients (52.5% vs 18%), despite late treatment initiation in both [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Common oseltamivir resistance&#x02013;conferring neuraminidase mutations, including H275Y, R293K, and N295S [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], were not detected during treatment in any of the specimens tested. In addition, we looked for a range of other neuraminidase mutations reportedly associated with reduced oseltamivir susceptibility in recently published whole-genome, next-generation sequencing data that we generated from 44 Indonesian patients to study viral quasispecies evolution during human infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Except for 2 variants present as minority viral populations in 4 patients (V116A in 3 patients at 3.6%&#x02013;6.0% of the viral population, N295S in 1 at 1.6%), other substitutions were not observed [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">&#x02013;26</xref>].</p><p>The above observations argue against the emergence of known resistance mutations to explain the apparent limited benefit of oseltamivir treatment in Indonesian patients. However, in vitro susceptibility testing of H5N1 viruses has shown that clade 2.1 viruses are intrinsically up to 30-fold less susceptible to oseltamivir than clade 1 viruses [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similar differences in oseltamivir susceptibility between human seasonal influenza A and B viruses have been linked to a longer duration of virus shedding and fever during treatment of influenza B virus&#x02013;infected patients [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Along the same lines, it cannot be excluded that similar differences in drug susceptibility between clade 1 and clade 2.1 H5N1 viruses are associated with differences in antiviral responses and consequently clinical benefit. In a small case series of Vietnamese H5N1 clade 1&#x02013;infected patients, rapid reductions in viral RNA to undetectable levels, mostly within 2 days of treatment, were observed in surviving patients, while viral RNA remained detectable at high levels in fatal cases and was associated with the emergence of resistance [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These observations appear to contrast with our findings in Indonesian patients that show that, despite an absence of oseltamivir resistance mutations, viral RNA was still detectable after 2 days of treatment in 42 of 44 patients and remained detectable throughout the course of treatment in the vast majority of patients who were followed. Although the numbers of evaluated patients are limited, this might be explained by the aforementioned differences in oseltamivir susceptibility.</p><p>Changes in mortality were observed during the study period, increasing from 69% overall to 100% in 2012 and beyond. These changes in mortality over time correlated with increasing admission viral loads and with an increasing prevalence of viruses that contain adamantane resistance&#x02013;conferring M2 mutations during the same period. In turn, admission viral loads were higher in the presence of M2 mutations.</p><p>Time from illness onset to presentation of patients and initiation of treatment remained similar until 2012 but appeared longer thereafter, which may have contributed to the high mortality during that period. However, the increasing viral loads during the same period remain striking given that no correlation between viral RNA load and illness duration was observed overall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). In addition to supporting an important role of viral load in determining outcome, these observations suggest an increasing virulence of circulating H5N1 viruses over time, possibly associated with the presence of M2 substitutions. Similar to observations in seasonal human influenza viruses [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the increasing prevalence of adamantane resistance M2 mutations in Indonesian H5N1 viruses occurred in the absence of apparent widespread use of amantadine, neither in poultry nor in humans. This suggests that the presence of these mutations is associated with a natural fitness advantage, either indirectly through a genetic &#x0201c;hitchhiking&#x0201d; effect in association with changes elsewhere in the viral genome or directly through potential advantageous effects on the biological function of the M2 protein. The latter direct biological role of observed M2 mutations in enhancing virulence cannot be excluded and deserves further study. In murine experiments, mortality in mice infected with isogenic recombinant H1N1 viruses that harbored amantadine resistance mutations (Val27Ala, Ser31Gly, or both) was higher than in mice infected with wild-type H1N1 viruses [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the Val27Ala change in M2, representing the most prevalent mutation observed in our patients, has been associated with increased M2 activity in avian influenza A/H7N1 viruses, which suggests that this particular substitution may have functional significance [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our study of a large series of H5N1-infected Indonesian patients confirms the association between high upper respiratory viral loads and fatal outcome and provides information to explain the exceptionally high mortality related to H5N1 disease in Indonesia, including a high proportion of patients with viremia, potential suboptimal antiviral efficacy of oseltamivir, and an increasing virulence of circulating viruses, possibly associated with the emergence of M2 mutations. These observations deserve consideration in future further research efforts in human infections with H5N1 and other avian influenza viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s11"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
