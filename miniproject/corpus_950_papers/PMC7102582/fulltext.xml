The disease is primarily spread through large respiratory droplets, though the possibility of other routes of transmission cannot be ruled out, as the virus has been found in stool and urine of affected individuals [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The disease severity has varied from mild self-limiting flu-like illness to fulminant pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. There are regional variations in the mortality rates and these estimates are rapidly changing as more data are becoming available. There were 95,333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4% according to the situation report of World Health Organisation on March 5, 2020 [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, a much lower mortality of 1.4% has been reported in analysis of data of 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 552 hospitals in mainland China [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Considering that the number of unreported and unconfirmed cases is likely to be much higher than the reported cases, the actual mortality may be less than 1%, which is similar to that of severe seasonal influenza [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. India has 39confirmed cases till 10th March, 2020 and contact surveillance of these cases is going on. The understanding of epidemiological characteristics of this infection is evolving on a daily basis as the disease is spreading to different parts of the globe.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Diabetes, respiratory infections and COVID19</title><p id="p0015">Individuals with diabetes are at risk of infections, especially influenza and pneumonia. This risk can be reduced, though not completely eliminated, by good glycaemic control. All people with diabetes (above 2 years of age) are recommended pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccinations. Not only this, patients with diabetes have a severe disease when infected with respiratory viruses. Indeed, diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for mortality in patients infected with Pandemic Influenza A 2009 (H1N1), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERSCoV) [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Data about COVID-19 in patients with diabetes is limited at present. Diabetes was present in 42.3% of 26 fatalities due to COVID-19 in Wuhan, China [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a study in 140 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, diabetes was not a risk factor for severe disease course [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, another study in 150 patients (68 deaths and 82 recovered patients) in Wuhan showed that the number of co-morbidities to be a significant predictor of mortality [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Analysis of 11 studies regarding laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 did not mention raised blood glucose or diabetes as predictor of severe disease [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Notwithstanding these small series, a report of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 published by Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed increased mortality in people with diabetes (2.3%, overall and 7.3%, patients with diabetes) [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Measures to prevent COVID-19</title><p id="p0025">Our knowledge about the prevalence of COVID-19 and disease course in people with diabetes will evolve as more detailed analyses are carried out. For now, it is reasonable to assume that people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing infection with SARS-CoV-2.
