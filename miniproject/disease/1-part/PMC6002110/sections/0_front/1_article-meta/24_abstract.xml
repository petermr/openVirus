 <p>Yellow fever (YF) is endemic in the Brazilian Amazon Basin, but sporadic outbreaks may take place outside this region. At the end of 2016, YF epidemics have been occurring in Southeast Brazil, with thousands of human cases (more than 1,900) and deaths of non-human primates (NHPs) reported so far. To better understand the origin and dynamics of YFV associated with these epidemics, we studied part of the viral genome obtained from humans and NHPs, in 2016 to 2018. All YFV grouped within a single group, indicating a single event of virus introduction in Southeast Brazil. Epidemiological data combined with our results suggested that the virus might have been introduced from the Midwest into the Southeast region, one year before the first outbreak was detected (2016). The persistence of YFV in the Southeast, causing epidemics from 2016 to 2018 indicates that this region presents suitable conditions for YFV maintenance, during the epidemic and non-epidemic periods. This fact may represent a risk for YFV establishment in Southeast Brazil. This information should be carefully considered by public health decision-makers and researchers in Brazil.</p>
