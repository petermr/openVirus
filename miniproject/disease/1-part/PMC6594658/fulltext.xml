Indirect estimates of risk from vector habitat suitability maps are prone to great uncertainty, while direct estimates from epidemiological data are only possible after cases accumulate and, given environmental constraints on arbovirus transmission, cannot be widely generalized beyond the focal region. Combining these complementary methods, we use disease importation and transmission data to improve the accuracy and precision of <italic>a priori</italic> ecological risk estimates. We demonstrate this approach by estimating the spatiotemporal risks of Zika virus transmission throughout Texas, a high-risk region in the southern United States. Our estimates are, on average, 80% lower than published ecological estimates&#x02014;with only six of 254 Texas counties deemed capable of sustaining a Zika epidemic&#x02014;and they are consistent with the number of autochthonous cases detected in 2017. Importantly our method provides a framework for model comparison, as our mechanistic understanding of arbovirus transmission continues to improve. Real-time updating of prior risk estimates as importations and outbreaks arise can thereby provide critical, early insight into local transmission risks as emerging arboviruses expand their global reach.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>When novel infectious diseases like chikungunya or Zika emerge and threaten global spread, public health officials worldwide must assess the risk for local introductions and outbreaks. These assessments are made in anticipation of local case data, and officials must draw upon historic evidence from similar diseases or locations. Thus, accurate local risk assessments have most often been limited to retrospective analyses and have been unavailable in real-time during an emerging epidemic. Here we present a method that can harness both historic and current data to produce early risk assessments and update projections in real-time. We demonstrate our approach by estimating local transmission risk for Zika throughout the state of Texas. Our findings suggest that the majority of Texas counties face little risk for sustaining a Zika epidemic, and successfully predict the number of locally transmitted cases across the state. Real-time updating of local transmission risk estimates during an emerging epidemic can thus provide actionable, early insight for public health response as emerging arboviruses expand their global reach.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This publication was supported by Cooperative Agreement Number U01CK000512, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Officials scrambled not only to control the disease at its source but also to anticipate and rapidly contain global transmission via infected travelers [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The rate at which a newly introduced pathogen spreads can vary enormously though, particularly for ZIKV and other pathogens with multi-faceted drivers of their transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, serological surveys of human exposure to the ecologically similar dengue virus (DENV) on either side of the Texas-Mexico border indicated far higher DENV exposure in the Mexican community, despite virtually identical climatic conditions and even higher mosquito abundance in the Texan community [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This result suggests that <italic>a priori</italic> prediction of risk may be quite challenging.</p><p>Epidemiological risk assessment&#x02014;estimating the severity and transmissibility of a threatening disease&#x02014;can be vital to successful mitigation with limited resources. Historical outbreak data can provide invaluable insight into future epidemic risk. However, for a pathogen that has yet to arrive or has just begun to spread, we are forced to borrow epidemiological data from other populations or related pathogens, or to indirectly assess risk based on environmental suitability. For example, as the first importations of ZIKV arrived in the US in 2016, early attempts to determine the likelihood and rate of local transmission relied primarily on dengue epidemiological data from regions with markedly different climatic and socioeconomic conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>These ecological risk assessments provide information regarding the basic reproduction number of a disease (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>)&#x02014;the expected number of secondary human infections resulting from a single human infection&#x02014;which provides a meaningful and predictive measure of local epidemiological risk. For ZIKV, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> encompasses the combined effects of the multi-step transmission life cycle: a mosquito biting an infected individual, incubating the disease and becoming infected, and finally biting and infecting a new susceptible individual. In a naive population, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> indicates whether importations can potentially lead to sustained local epidemics; if so, it also provides insight into the probability, magnitude, and speed of spread [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, ecological estimates often carry considerable uncertainty stemming from model parameterization and regional extrapolation, and suggest a wide range of possible epidemic outcomes, from terminal importations to stuttering chains of transmission to full blown epidemics [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Once an outbreak is underway, early case data can be used to directly estimate <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For arboviruses with environmentally constrained spatial heterogeneity, such case-based estimates cannot be easily extrapolated from one region to others.</p><p>Here, we introduce a method for performing real-time updating of ecologically informed estimates of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> that reconciles discrepancies between initial estimates of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> and real-time data on local transmission of an emerging arbovirus. This approach is applicable to settings in which there is an ongoing threat of arbovirus importation and in which transmission has not precipitated a large-scale epidemic. In particular, this work was motivated by recent introductions of ZIKV into the continental US. As hundreds of cases arrived from affected regions throughout the Americas, officials sought to estimate risks of autochthonous (local) transmission and identify high-risk regions in the southern US. However, given the novelty of ZIKV and the large proportion of ZIKV cases that go undetected, early ecological estimates had high uncertainty [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our method combines indirect and direct estimation methods to reduce such uncertainty and increase accuracy at high spatiotemporal resolution. We first build prior ecological estimates of local <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> and then harness real-time importation data&#x02014;cases that arrive in a naive location with or without subsequently infecting others&#x02014;to update the estimates, while explicitly modeling case reporting uncertainty. As a case study, we use the almost complete absence of secondary transmission following 298 importations of ZIKV into the state of Texas in 2016 and 2017 to lower and narrow local estimates of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We used a two-step procedure to estimate the monthly <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> for each of the 254 Texas counties (hereafter county-month <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>): (1) estimate <italic>a priori</italic> county-month <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> distributions using published ecological models of ZIKV transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and (2) using these as Bayesian priors, generate posterior <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> distributions based on reported importations and subsequent local transmission.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Data</title><p>We analyzed all known ZIKV importations into Texas from January 2016 to September 2017, including the county and notification date; county-level purchasing power parity (PPP) in US dollars [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; daily temperature data at a 5 km x 5 km resolution for 2016-2017 and historical averages from 1960-1990 [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

For updating <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> estimates, we analyzed 2016 data where two autochthonous cases were detected in Cameron County from passive surveillance&#x02013;one in November and one in December 2016; we excluded four nearby cases discovered during the November follow-up investigation, because our model does not incorporate active surveillance.

Accounting for this worst-case scenario lead to increased estimates for risk across the state, but expected risk still remained well below epidemic potential. For validating our estimates, we analyzed 2017 data and considered only one of the two reported autochthonous cases, as the second case occurred outside the timeline of our 2017 importation data.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>A priori county-month <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> estimates</title><p>For ZIKV to be locally transmitted in a location, a mosquito must bite an individual, the mosquito must be infectious with the virus, and then that mosquito must bite a susceptible individual and transmit that virus.

In fact, these initial expectations for transmission were lowered even further prior to the detected locally acquired case in November. Since we estimated the posterior distributions for transmission risk and the statewide scaling factor jointly, we were able to compare the prior and posterior estimates to understand if specific counties were downgraded more or less than expected by the statewide average. We find that the ratio between prior and posterior estimates tends to average near the statewide scaling factor of 0.19, except for counties that experienced many reported importations during the year (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s013">S12 Fig</xref>). These counties tended to have lower than average ratios like Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, and Cameron counties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s013">S12 Fig</xref>). While the timing of the autochthonous transmission may not have been predicted using our initial risk estimates, the transmission events both occurred in the southern tip of Texas (Cameron county), which was predicted to be the highest risk county during those months.</p><p>The temporal mismatch between the model predictions and the observed ZIKV local transmission in November and December might stem from the a priori transmission risk model, which constrains posterior estimates. Specifically, the model does not account for potential time lags between ZIKV environmental suitability and eventual emergence of locally acquired cases. Environmental determinants of mosquito population growth may take several weeks or months to impact arbovirus risk. Furthermore, the timing of case reports following infection will depend on the timing and severity of symptoms, healthcare seeking behavior and clinical reporting.

In essence we shifted transmission risk estimates two months later than our baseline predictions suggested.

The resulting model yielded estimates that are more consistent with the observed ZIKV local transmission, although posterior risk estimates were remarkably consistent with our baseline results, with the highest risk period shifted by two months (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s014">S13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s015">S14</xref> Figs).

Since the sample size is low, we average the expected number of secondary cases over the 2017 time period where importation data were available. Assuming first that only the reported importations occurred in 2017 (26 total), we estimate that there should have been 0.08 (95%CI: 0-1) detected autochthonous cases in the state; assuming that many importations went undetected, according to the reporting probability (<inline-formula id="pntd.0007395.e008"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0007395.e008.jpg" id="pntd.0007395.e008g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M8"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>26</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>&#x02248;</mml:mo><mml:mn>453</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> cases), we estimate 1.3 (95% CI: 0-7) detected autochthonous cases.

Although it is receding in most regions of the world, ecological risk assessments suggest that previously unaffected or minimally affected areas may remain at risk for future emergence, including parts of Asia and South America [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Differentiating regions that can sustain a ZIKV epidemic (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x0003e; 1) from those that cannot is vital to effective planning and resource allocation for future preparedness plans. To address this challenge, we have developed a simple method for refining uncertain risk assessments with readily available data on disease importations.</p><p>Using previously validated ecological suitability estimates as a starting point, we applied the method to update ZIKV <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> estimates for each of the 254 counties in Texas, and found that only six counties have non-negligible probabilities of sustained local transmission, though an additional 77 counties may also be at low risk if our assumptions about local case data are too liberal. This is a substantial downgrade in expected risk, given that 43% of the 254 counties were previously thought to be vulnerable to ZIKV outbreaks, and even counties still at risk for epidemics on average had <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> estimates downgraded by 80% [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on these estimates and the number of importations that occurred in the state, our refined model suggests that there should have been between zero and one detected case of locally acquired ZIKV between January and September of 2017, which corresponds to the single transmission event actually detected in Cameron County in July 2017. Interestingly, a model that incorporates the possibility of many more missed imported cases into the state of Texas fits the data better, with an expected number of cases close to one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007395.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>There is a discrepancy between our model predictions and the ZIKV case data: our final model predicts the highest local transmission risk to be in the summer across the state, but most cases of local ZIKV transmission occurred in the winter (6 out of 7). While these case numbers are low and may simply reflect random variation, the most recent dengue outbreak in South Texas peaked in November, concurrent with a large dengue epidemic in Northern Mexico, suggesting that fall may be a higher risk season for arbovirus transmission than our final predictions indicate [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The discrepancy likely stem from errors in our initial risk estimates, which serve as informative priors for our analysis. Our model does not incorporate a time lag between case importation, local transmission, and case detection, which has been previously estimated around two months [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Incorporating a two month lag in our model slightly increased the fit of the resulting predictions (BIC = 2.9), but does not produce qualitatively different results in the magnitude of county risk other than the temporal shift <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s015">S14 Fig</xref>. While these results were promising, we chose to present our baseline results instead of those from the lagged model, because the baseline model has been previously validated [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Importantly our simplistic lagging procedure does not properly encapsulate the mechanistic intricacies determining the relationship between environmental suitability, mosquito population growth, case importation, local transmission, and subsequent detection that account for the lags outlined in [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results support these time lags as a crucial element for predicting ZIKV risk, and highlight the need for future research into the mechanistic underpinnings to reduce bias and improve model fit and predictive accuracy even further.</p><p>The factors driving county transmission risk were primarily temperature and mosquito population numbers (occurrence probability). Remaining uncertainty in county risk stems from a lack of detected imported cases, as imported cases primarily helped to downgrade Zika risk in the absence of local transmission. This provides the counterintuitive explanation for why our model suggests low epidemic risk for Harris county (containing the city of Houston) even though it was by far the county with the most imported cases. Given comparable importation and local case data, this approach could readily update ZIKV transmission risk estimates for any county in the continental US.</p><p>Our estimation method relies on several simplifying assumptions, which we divide into those concerning this ZIKV test case of the updating procedure, and those concerning the updating procedure itself. For this specific implementation, we assumed that the shape of the secondary case distribution resembles that of dengue. Although we have no evidence to the contrary, this should be updated as ZIKV-specific estimates become available [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We also assumed that transmission is equally likely from imported and locally acquired cases. Imported cases may be less infectious than locally acquired cases for two reasons, leading us to underestimate local transmission risks. First, they may be more likely to receive care that limits transmission, although most ZIKV cases are inapparent or mild and do not require medical care [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and second their local infectious periods may be shorter than those of autochthonous cases. This assumption could be relaxed in cases where data are available on the relative detection rates. In this case, we also do not consider the possibility of sexual transmission of ZIKV. While sexual transmission has occurred and may be important for specific populations [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], we assumed that mosquito-borne transmission is the dominant mode of infection. Our current iteration of the model makes several simplifying assumptions related to how we handle the temporal dynamics of both the <italic>a priori</italic> risk estimation and the updating procedure. Our baseline transmission risk model does not take any outside events that could modulate future risk into consideration (e.g. rainfall in the previous month causing upticks in mosquito populations), and future model development will be necessary to account for these important temporal dynamics [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For example, approaches that account for variability in the serial interval between successive cases and distributed lagged effects of environmental variables on transmission potential may hold promise for addressing this limitation [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The updating method itself also requires several simplifying assumptions. First, it relies on informative Bayesian priors for the relative spatiotemporal risk of a region. Posterior estimates could be biased by errors in these priors. At this point, we lack sufficient data from Texas to improve our estimates of the component parameters of <italic>a priori</italic>
<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>. The lack of such data, in fact, motivated our more modest goal of refining estimates of relative risk across counties. We could potentially improve model accuracy by incorporating smoothing techniques that more realistically capture spatiotemporal correlations and heterogeneity in transmission risk across Texas. This method also treats all importations as independent. However, spatiotemporal heterogeneity in case detection probabilities or clustering of cases (e.g., testing of travel companions) could bias risk estimates. When secondary clusters are detected, we assume they share a transmission tree stemming from a single detected importation. In this case, the low ZIKV detection rate suggests that both primary importations and secondary cases are likely to be missed. If the detection rates between the two types of cases are roughly similar our results hold. If importations are detected at higher rates than secondary cases, then the resulting risk estimates will be higher; when we assume the reverse, meaning locally transmitted cases are more likely to be detected than imported cases, the posterior risk estimates will be reduced. The additional assumption, that clusters are epidemiologically connected, seems reasonable for the small contained outbreaks detected in Texas, but may not be appropriate for importation-fueled arbovirus outbreaks in Florida, for example. In such cases, molecular data might enable estimation of transmission clusters [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, there are identifiability issues associated with estimating the statewide scaling factor alongside the case detection probability, as both parameters modulate the expected number of secondary cases in the same fashion. We therefore used a strong, informative prior for the case detection probability from a previous study, and found no changes in the posterior distribution <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s006">S5 Fig</xref>. If case detection is lower than we assumed, then the detected cases in Texas would have had to arise from larger outbreaks, so our final risk estimates would be closer to the prior (larger). Alternatively, if case detection in Texas is higher than we assumed, there would be an even larger discrepancy between our prior and resultant posterior risk estimates <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007395.s016">S15 Fig</xref>.</p><p>During the height of the ZIKV threat, public health agencies in the US rapidly implemented both preventative measures (e.g., vector control and educational campaigns) and response measures (e.g., laboratory testing and epidemic trigger plans), particularly in high-risk southern states. Decision makers sought to identify and narrow the spatiotemporal scope of outbreak risk to enable targeted responses, efficiently allocate resources, and avoid false alarms [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our method facilitates such rapid, real-time geographic risk estimation from typical early outbreak data, and allows for real-time updating of estimates as new data arise. In interpreting our results from 2016 in retrospect, they would suggest that the baseline transmission risk combined with the public health response was sufficient to mitigate the threat of a ZIKV epidemic across the state. Our method cannot disentangle the impact of public health response from the underlying transmission risk, so we cannot estimate the impact of the public health interventions. In real time, our results would have validated the magnitude of the public health response through the summer of 2016, and likely alleviated some of the epidemic concerns that arose in the winter when a handful of locally transmitted cases were detected in the state.</p><p>Critically, we can conclude neither that all initial ecological risk assessments for ZIKV will overestimate risk, although this seems to be the case for ZIKV in Texas and elsewhere in the US [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], nor that public health preparations and interventions for ZIKV are no longer necessary in Texas or the southern US. Rather, our results suggest that sustained ZIKV outbreaks are unlikely, but not impossible (3% of the state remains at low epidemic risk), and provide more robust and localized estimates of ZIKV risk that can inform more targeted surveillance and reactions to future ZIKV importations. While our method provides an avenue to improve imperfect <italic>a priori</italic> risk estimates using real-time data, future predictions and estimates could be improved with advances to our mechanistic understanding of transmission risk (e.g., incorporating rainfall or improved understanding of mosquito-human contact patterns) [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These estimates should also only be taken as the baseline level of risk for the state. Climate change, anomalous weather events, or unforeseen circumstances that alter mosquito populations or mosquito-human interactions could raise or lower the Zika risk in Texas [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>This framework is novel in its integration of <italic>a priori</italic> ecological transmission risk estimates with updating directly from real-time case reports [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It thereby provides increasingly accurate and precise risk assessments to support public health decision making, and can be generalized to update <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> estimates from importation data, regardless of the <italic>a priori</italic> method of estimation. For example, a new approach combining epidemiological and molecular analyses suggests that transmission risk in Florida is subcritical (i.e., <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &#x0003c; 1) [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Given that Florida experienced thousands of introductions, only a few of which sparked large outbreaks, coupling such outbreak-driven estimation with our terminal importation method may provide a powerful real-time risk assessment framework for exploiting all available data. This method resembles those used to assess disease transmission risk during elimination efforts, including malaria in non-endemic regions [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The key innovation is that, by starting with ecological suitability maps, we simultaneously identify important transmission hotspots and leverage case data from one region to inform risk estimates elsewhere.</p><p>We presented a simple and rational method for continuously updating transmission risk estimates for populations experiencing infectious disease importations, with or without secondary transmission. As we demonstrated for ZIKV in Texas, large numbers of terminal importations can profoundly lower both estimated risks of transmission and uncertainty in prior estimates, particularly those derived from ecological suitability or other models that borrow inputs from related pathogens in other parts of the world. Expanding our model to other regions could sharpen transmission risk estimates, and allow for more targeted public health interventions in the remaining hot spot locations [<xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007395.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Transmission risk estimates always include uncertainty, but by assimilating data in real-time, our method can help confirm or revise public health understanding in the midst of an outbreak. Although the threat of ZIKV emergence in the continental US motivated this study, this new framework can be applied to improve transmission risk assessments when a disease newly threatens a population via regular introductions with minimal secondary transmission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007395.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supplemental information.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007395.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007395.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Sensitivity analysis of posterior <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> estimates for each county.</title><p>Each point indicates a county-month posterior <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> estimate under different estimation scenarios.
