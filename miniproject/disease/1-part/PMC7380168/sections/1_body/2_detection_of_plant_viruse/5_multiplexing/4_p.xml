<p>Microsphere technology, like Luminex xMAP, can detect up to 500 targets in a single sample. It is based on microspheres (beads) coated with specific antibodies or oligonucleotides, which capture respectively viruses or PCR products obtained from their genetic material. The beads have been dyed into spectrally distinct sets, or “regions,” allowing them to be individually identified. After binding, the target is labeled by specific conjugated antibodies or probes which will give a fluorescent signal. The color code of the bead in combination with the fluorescent signal identifies a unique combination (
