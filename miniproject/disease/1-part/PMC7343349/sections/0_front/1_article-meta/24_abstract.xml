 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is primarily maintained in an enzootic cycle involving nonhuman primates and mosquitoes, with epizootics and epidemics occurring when the virus is introduced into naïve populations of nonhuman primates or humans, respectively. While, the primary transmission mechanism of the virus is by the bite on an infected mosquito, ZIKV can also be sexually transmitted. In an effort to develop novel animal models to study ZIKV disease, and to better understand the role of nonhuman primates as amplification and maintenance hosts of ZIKV in nature, we modeled mosquito-borne and sexual transmission of ZIKV in the enzootic host, the African green monkey (AGM). Infection dynamics and neutralizing antibody responses in all three AGM ZIKV models (subcutaneous, intravaginal and intrarectal) in the absence of clinical illness–recapitulated reported generalized human disease course. Furthermore, we detected prolonged shedding with high viral loads and infectious virus in the vaginal swabs collected from an infected female AGM inoculated intrarectally. Notably, these results support limited human clinical evidence that ZIKV transmission can occur during female-to-male vaginal sexual acts, and furthermore indicate the existence of ZIKV super-spreaders. Finally, our results indicate sexual transmission of ZIKV could occur among infected nonhuman primates (e.g. 
  <italic>Chlorocebus</italic> spp.) in Africa and may serve as a secondary transmission and maintenance mechanism in the absence of mosquito-to-nonhuman primate transmission.
