 <p>Chikungunya virus has re-emerged as an important pathogen causing several outbreaks in the world. As the clinical symptoms of chikungunya is similar to other mosquito-borne febrile diseases, the definitive diagnosis of the disease is based on the detection of viral genome from the patient blood. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a method that rapidly amplify nucleic acids under isothermal condition. In the present work, a simple dried format LAMP test for chikungunya diagnosis was developed which can be directly amplified from human blood. Combining with the portable sequencer MinION sequencing system, a method to identify the viral genotype was also established. The developed on-site diagnosis and genotyping system is easy to perform, sensitive, and rapid. Therefore, it offers great promise as a routine simple tool for diagnosis and disease management of chikungunya.</p>
