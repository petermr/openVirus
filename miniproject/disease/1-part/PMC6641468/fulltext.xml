The disease severity may range from mild to severe, sometimes leading to fatality, especially among infants, elderly, immune-compromised persons and various other high risk groups.The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 3&#x02013;5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000&#x02013;650,000 deaths worldwide in 2017 due to seasonal influenza epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Influenza is known to have a specific pattern of seasonality the reasons for which are yet to be fully ascertained [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies report that temperate zones show influenza epidemic during the winter months of November-March in northern hemisphere and May-September in southern hemisphere [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The tropical and subtropical regions show more diverse influenza outbreak patterns. Annual epidemics occur in the tropical locations that usually coincide with the rainy season, while biannual incidence is the norm in some regions, and influenza activity occurs throughout the year in other countries [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There is limited understanding about the epidemiology of influenza and the characteristics of seasonal influenza in the tropical region where there is influenza activity all throughout the year.[<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>A number of theories have been proposed over the years to explain the seasonality of these epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These consider that cool and dry surroundings are the reason for this [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In tropical and subtropical regions the upsurge of influenza has been coupled with precipitation (rain). Epidemics also occur in these regions in other seasons, when the atmospheric conditions are humid and hot [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In some sub-tropical and tropical regions no significant relation between rainfall and influenza activity has been observed [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>There are three mediating mechanisms that might help in explaining influenza activity and epidemics: 1) Contact rate, 2) Viral survival and 3) Host immunity [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Climatic conditions like humidity, temperature and precipitation play a great role in elevating viral survival and activity. It has been speculated that low indoor humidity, cool temperature and less solar radiations support viral activity, especially during the winter epidemics in the temperate zone. Recent evidence shows that rainy season favours viral survival and disease transmission in tropics [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is possible that the seasonal factors that govern activity of influenza virus in temperate zones do not impact influenza virus very strongly in the tropics. [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Pakistan is situated in South-East Asia with tropical to temperate climatic conditions and arid environment in the southern region. The country had a robust laboratory-based influenza sentinel surveillance system in eight sites from 2009&#x02013;2016. This provided an opportunity to study the relationship between meteorological parameters (humidity, precipitation and temperature) and influenza activity in two major cities of Pakistan, Islamabad and Multan in the post 2011 pandemic period. We also sought to explore the seasonality of influenza activity and predict influenza peak based on historical surveillance time series data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a descriptive study of routinely collected monthly influenza sentinel surveillance and meteorological data from 2012&#x02013;16 in two geographical sentinel sites of Pakistan: Islamabad (North) with geo-coordinates of latitude: 33.738 and longitude: 73.084and Multan (Central) with geo-coordinates of latitude: 30.181and longitude: 71.492.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Setting</title><sec id="sec009"><title>General setting</title><p>Pakistan is the fifth most populous South Asian country [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, and patterns of alternate flooding and drought are common.[<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The climate of Islamabad is humid subtropical type with five distinct seasons: winter (November&#x02212;February), spring (March&#x02212;April), summer (May&#x02212;June), monsoon (July&#x02212;August) and autumn (September&#x02212;October). June is the hottest with temperature routinely soaring above 38&#x000b0;C (100.4&#x000b0;F). July witnesses heavy rainfall whereas January is cold with temperatures usually dropping below zero degrees[<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Multan is located in the southern part of Punjab province in Pakistan.

The city witnesses some of the most extreme temperatures in the country. Being close to the deserts, it has seen some of the worst heat waves in the history of Pakistan with scanty rainfall.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Influenza surveillance system</title><p>In 2008, a sentinel laboratory-based influenza surveillance network was established in collaboration with the US-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Federal Government Services Hospital in Islamabad was the first sentinel site under the network [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Seven more influenza surveillance sentinel sites in high load tertiary hospitals across four provinces and two regions have been set up since then. This includes the Nishter Medical Collage and Hospital Multan in 2012.</p><p>In each of the study sites, presumptive cases i.e. Influenza like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) were referred by the physicians (from the departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, Ear Nose and Throat and Obstetrics and Gynecology) to the project laboratory technician for throat/nasopharyngeal swab collection. The laboratory staff and other project staff were trained in sample processing and testing, data entry and database maintenance. The sample collected was then sent to the virology laboratory for testing. The demographic and clinical data were recorded at the time of sample collection and also validated by cross-checking with the hospital patient records.</p><p>Laboratory testingThroat and/or nasopharyngeal swabs collected from suspected cases in 2&#x02013;3 ml viral transport medium (Virocult) were stored at -70&#x000b0;C before use.

The samples were analyzed by one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on Applied Biosystems platform ABI 7500 following recommended US-CDC protocol.

between meteorological parameters and influenza activity in two major cities of Pakistan in the post-2011 pandemic period and also predicts influenza activity based on historical surveillance time series data. Time series analysis of infections is useful to propose new hypotheses, predict epidemics and peaks, and improve the disease response system. This study used the exponential smoothing model to forecast influenza incidence, contributing to an early warning system that can help public health planners take appropriate preventive measures, improve public awareness, and tackle the situation effectively.</p><p>The association between influenza activity and climatic factors was assessed for 78 geographical locations around the globe. At high latitudes, influenza peaks coincided with months of lower temperature and lower humidity.In contrast, peak influenza activity in localities within 10&#x000b0; of the equator correlated with months of high specific humidity and precipitation.At intermediate latitudes such as Pakistan, no significant association was observed which somewhat supports the findings of this study[<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The study had some interesting findings. First, influenza activity, in terms of number of cases and test positivity both negatively correlated with temperature. This finding is consistent with studies from Portland and New York in the United States. [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the other hand, studies in Thailand and the tropical Central American countries like Guatemala, El Salvador and Panama with an average temperature of 25&#x02013;29 <sup>o</sup>C showed a positive correlation with temperature [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Second, in contrast to the studies elsewhere, no significant correlation was found between humidity levels and influenza activity [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, amulti-site influenza study from India reported a positive correlation between relative humidity and influenza positive cases by multivariate analysis[<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another study from Thailand showed that only maximum relative humidity correlated with suspected influenza cases in the southern region, whereas all parameters including maximum, minimum, and average relative humidity correlated with suspected influenza cases in the central region[<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Third, the study forecasted significant peak during the month of January with no declining trend [<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219376.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This could be useful information for the administrators to prepare for the peak and mitigate it effectively.</p><p>The study has some significant strong points. First, the influenza surveillance data were part of a US-CDC supported laboratory based sentinel surveillance project in tertiary care hospitals across the country with high patient influx. Confirmation of diagnosis of influenza was done using real time RT-PCR which is the gold standard test. Second, five-year historical data (2008&#x02013;17) on influenza surveillance in two major cities of the country allows a better understanding of the trend and accurate forecasting of the disease. The quality and consistency of the surveillance data is likely to produce meaningful predictions for policy decisions.</p><p>The study had some limitations as well. First, the cases of influenza presented in this study were reported from hospital-based sentinel surveillance sites, thus, missing out an unknown proportion of cases in the community who could not visit the facilities due to poor access or did not require hospital care due to mild symptoms or visited the private sector and other levels of health care. Second, the prediction models are generally used for short-term forecasts because the relative bias of prediction increases with time. This might be explained by antigenic drift of the influenza virus and many unknown factors that affect disease transmission. Third, we could only infer associations, but not causality, between influenza activity and various meteorological parameters. As a result, the associations we found may act only as proxies for factors not considered in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the influenza surveillance system gave a better understanding of the disease trend and could accurately forecast influenza activity in Pakistan. Exponential smoothing model was the best fit statistical model for predicting influenza cases. This information will be useful for public health administrators in effectively implementing preventive and control measures for the seasonal influenza outbreaks or epidemics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219376.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Climate SPSS for means.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219376.s001.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219376.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Climate data-average.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219376.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219376.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Suppl Fig 1.</title><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219376.s003.pptx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was conducted through the Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SORT IT), a global partnership led by the Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases at the World Health Organization (WHO/TDR).
