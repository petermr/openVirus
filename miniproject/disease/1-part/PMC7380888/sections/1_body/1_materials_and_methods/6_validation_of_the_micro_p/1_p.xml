<p>The blood meal volume obtained from a single field-collected, blood-fed mosquito is sufficient for the micro-PRNT assay, but in order to ascertain the assay’s robustness against a range of host antibody titres and post-feeding times, and facilitate the dilutions that these experiments required, we used larger volumes of mosquito-derived blood in our validations. These were obtained by pooling three blood meals from engorged mosquitoes that had fed on the same antibody-positive source. One pool was used for each post-feeding time point tested. Abdominal contents were diluted by 1:20, 1:40, 1:80 and 1:160 using serum-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% PSG and 0.4% amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The final reported blood volume was calculated based on dilution of a 3 μl blood meal [

A range of controls were also processed to assess the impacts of sero-negative mosquito homogenates on the inhibition of plaque forming units. This entailed a comparison of 1) RRV alone 2) RRV plus unfed mosquito abdomens, and 3) RRV plus the abdomens of mosquitoes that contained sheep blood supplemented with seronegative human sera. In every case, the RRV pfu was kept constant.
