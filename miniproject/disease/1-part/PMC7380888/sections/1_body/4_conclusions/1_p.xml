<p>The value of the micro-PRNT lies in its ability to detect anti-virus antibodies from mosquito blood meals obtained from any vertebrate host. When coupled with molecular identification of the host by DNA amplification and sequencing, valuable information on vector-host relationships, wildlife sero-prevalence rates and zoonotic transmission cycles can be inferred [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This novel xenodiagnostic offers an alternative “flying syringe” approach for serum sampling and for monitoring sero-prevalence in animals. The use of this assay to characterise the blood meals of mosquitoes collected from the field in Brisbane is now underway.
