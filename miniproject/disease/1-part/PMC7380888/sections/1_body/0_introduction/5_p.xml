 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] has been investigated previously but existing studies required the use of host-specific conjugated antibodies. This is of little utility for the investigation of complex zoonoses like RRV where the hosts are myriad or unknown. The “gold standard” of serological tests is the Plaque Reduction Neutralisation Test (PRNT) [
 <xref rid="pone.0229314.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It does not need prior knowledge of host origin but typically requires large quantities of sera or tissue; substantially larger than a typical mosquito blood meal (estimated to be 3 μl [
