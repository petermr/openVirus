  <p id="Par1">
   <italic>Liao ning virus</italic> (LNV) is a member of the genus 
   <italic>Seadornavirus</italic>, family 
   <italic>Reoviridae</italic> and has been isolated from kinds of vectors in Asia and Australia. However, there are no systematic studies describe the molecular genetic evolution and migration of LNVs. With the development of bioinformatics, viral genetic data combining the information of virus isolation time and locations could be integrated to infer the virus evolution and spread in nature.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">Here, a phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations was conducted on the LNVs isolated from a variety of vectors during 1990–2014 to identify the evolution and migration patterns of LNVs.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">The results demonstrated that the LNV could be divided into 3 genotypes, of which genotype 1 mainly composed of LNVs isolated from Australia during 1990 to 2014 and the original LNV strain (LNV-NE97–31) isolated from Liaoning province in northern China in 1997, genotype 2 comprised of the isolates all from Xinjiang province in western China and genotype 3 consisted the isolates from Qinghai and Shanxi province of central China. LNVs emerged about 272 years ago and gradually evolved into three lineages in the order genotype 1, genotype 2 and genotype 3. Following phylogeographic analysis, it shows genotype 1 LNVs transmitted from Australia (113°E-153°E,10°S-42°S) to Liaoning province (118°E-125°E,38°N-43°N) in Northeast Asian continent then further spread across the central part of China to western China (75°E-95°E,35°N-50°N).</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">LNVs were initially isolated from Liaoning province of China in the Northeast Asia, however, the present study revealed that LNVs were first appeared in Australia in the South Pacific region and transmitted to mainland China then rapidly spread across China and evolved three different genotypes. The above results suggested that LNV had the characteristics of long-distance transmission and there were great genetic diversity existed in the LNV population. Notably, current information of 80 strains of LNVs are limited. It is of great importance to strengthen the surveillance of LNVs to explore its real origin in nature and monitoring of the LNVs’ population variation and maintain vigilance to avoid LNV breaking through the species barrier and further clarify its relationship to human and animal infection.</p>
