 <p>Dengue fever remains a major public health problem in all tropical regions of the world and causes 390 million infections each year. In Africa, while dengue outbreaks were rare during the last century, recurrent urban epidemic have been reported in all regions the last decade. Serotype 3, never reported in West Africa, caused major outbreaks in 2009 in several capital cities while serotype 2, usually confined to the forest cycle, spilled over into urban areas in Senegal and Mauritania in 2014–2015. These changes are occurring in a context where vector control remains the only effective approach to prevent and control epidemics. However, the design and the implementation of efficient vector control require an accurate knowledge of the vector bionomics and competence while such data are lacking in the African region. To fill out this gap we experimentally infected domestic and wild mosquitoes from Senegal to assess their vector competence for dengue serotypes 1, 3 and 4. Finally both domestic and wild Senegalese mosquitoes showed a low ability to transmit dengue viruses.</p>
