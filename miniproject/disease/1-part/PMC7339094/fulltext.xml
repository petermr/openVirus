The most implicated viruses are those that commonly cause community-based respiratory diseases: respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza virus and rhinovirus. However, in some cases the clinical picture may be triggered by first infection with or reactivation of pathogens normally not responsible for clinically relevant diseases in immunocompetent subjects. This issue is currently being taken into greater consideration within the scientific community. However, the strong heterogeneity in the epidemiology and clinical expression of these infections and the lack of adequate therapeutic options imply that there is currently no uniform consensus on the best management of these patients. The main purpose of this review is to highlight which viruses are currently most implicated in the onset of these infections, what is their incidence in&#x000a0;so heterogeneous and&#x000a0;fragile patients and the factors that lead to disease's&#x000a0;onset and evolution. Possible or available clinical management options, diagnostic and therapeutic tools, and preventive and prophylaxis measures are also discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Hematological malignancy</kwd><kwd>Immunocompromised</kwd><kwd>Respiratory viral infections</kwd><kwd>Stem cell transplantation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="FPar1"><title>Key Summary Points</title><p id="Par505"><table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">Respiratory viral infections represent one of the most feared complications in the hematological patient in terms of both clinical severity and mortality.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Influenza (IFV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (RhV) and coronavirus (CoV) are the most relevant agents involved in respiratory infections.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients have an initial involvement of the upper respiratory tract; the feared progression to the lower respiratory tract is strictly related to clinical conditions of patients as well as several risk factors.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Defining effective therapeutic and prophylactic strategies is challenging, especially considering the variability spectrum of onco-hematological patients and the variety of respiratory viruses involved.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Although the scientific community recognizes the relevance of these infections, there is no uniform consensus on available clinical management options, diagnostic and therapeutic tools, and preventive and prophylaxis measures.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Infections are among the most important complications in subjects affected by cancer and/or in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and often endanger the life of the immunosuppressed patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Infections affecting the respiratory system are particularly frequent in this population, and those involving the lower respiratory tract (LRTI) are often related to the highest severity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among the various etiological agents, community-acquired respiratory viruses (CRVs) represent a relevant cause in terms of morbidity and mortality among patients with hematological malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">On one hand, the progress of therapeutic interventions has led to an increase in the survival and recovery of hematological patients; on the other, the wide use of chemotherapy and immunosuppressive treatments has further increased the infective risk for these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Although attempts have been made to standardize the clinical and therapeutic approach to infective complications in immunocompromised hematological patients, the clinical expression of infections is extremely variable. The continuous changes in the epidemiology of infections, clinical manifestations of hematological patients and available therapies imply a lack of an uniform consensus on the best management of infective complications and the need for continuous updates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

It is also important to raise awareness among patients and healthcare professionals about the impact of these viruses on immunocompromised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par98">The reduction of transmission of viral respiratory infections is potentially feasible through the adoption of a series of measures; the most effective ones include hand hygiene, screening of visiting family members for respiratory symptoms, education of healthcare staff and isolation of the patients with respiratory symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par99">The high cost of antiviral therapy and lack of a clear efficacy in these patients highlights the need for effective vaccines against these respiratory viruses. According to the 2013 Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines, an intramuscular influenza vaccine is recommended for all immunocompromised patients and HSCT recipients aged 6&#x000a0;months or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is also desirable to extend the annual immunization to family members and healthcare personnel in contact with the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Even in patients with multiple myeloma, an effective preventive strategy to reduce the risk of influenza is represented by the seasonal influenza immunization. Although patients with multiple myeloma are known to not have high levels of specific anti-influenza antibodies compared to healthy subjects, the vaccine reduces the risk of URTI and the number of hospitalizations. Strategies such as immunization before transplantation or a double-dose schedule improve the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par100">Neuramidase inhibitors should be prophylactically administered to all immunocompromised patients with a close contact with proven or suspected cases of infection. For influenza, the infective period is estimated from 1&#x000a0;day before to 7&#x000a0;days after the development of the symptoms, and post-exposure chemoprophylaxis should last up to 7&#x000a0;days after the last known exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par101">Regarding RSV, the prophylactic use of palivizumab (monoclonal antibody against RSV) in young children undergoing HSCT was recommended in the 2009 international guidelines to prevent infective complications; however, the lack of clear evidences on its efficacy has limited the application of this measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par102">The use of aerosol ribavirin and pavilizumab as preventive strategies in patients with URTI evolving in LRTI is still debated, especially in lymphopenic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par103">Regarding PiV, the real impact of ribavirin and of experimental anti-viral agents such as DAS 181 on mortality or on progression to pneumonia has yet to be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par104">Lastly, immunotherapy for RSV and influenza has so far given promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par105">As previously stated, infections caused by influenza virus have been successfully treated with neuramidase inhibitors (oseltamivir); however, its efficacy for influenza pneumonia has not been established, and antiviral resistance frequently occurs in immunocompromised patients.</p><p id="Par106">Retrospective studies demonstrate positive outcomes with ribavirin (alone or in combination with immunomodulators) for the treatment of RSV infections in patients with hematological disease and HSCT. However, no prospective clinical studies have yet been conducted to demonstrate its clear efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par107">Future studies should focus on strategies to identify patients at high risk of developing these infections and to determine the efficacy of available and new antiviral drugs.</p><p id="Par108">Phase 1 studies are currently in progress to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine against PIV; phase 2 studies evaluating the efficacy of the new agent DAS-181 against PIV in immunocompromised patients are ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par109">Hematological patients are by definition at risk subjects. Therefore, although respiratory viruses often cause self-limiting infections in the population, diagnosing these infections quickly in this group of patients is important for several reasons.</p><p id="Par110">First, we need to avoid complications, even fatal ones, related to these infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par111">Considering that the new treatments actually guarantee an increase in survival, a further positive effect could be achieved by strengthening the supportive treatments to combat these infections; this would allow obtaining better tolerability of the aggressive therapeutic regimens these patients undergo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The major limitation of this review is that reported results stem from few cases, often with limited significance. However, it is confirmed that respiratory viral infections continue to cause disease in both the pre- and post-transplant period; in the event of an onset in the pre-transplant period, it is advisable to delay the transplant, but there are no clear indications in this regard. Deferral of take in charge, although it could be the most reasonable choice, is not always feasible, especially in the presence of conditions such as important lymphopenia or persistent aplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par112">In children, where the viral shedding is longer, delayed treatment should be strongly considered, even in asymptomatic subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par113">The positive outcome of the transplant itself is strongly influenced by a possible progression of the disease from the upper to the lower respiratory tract.</p><p id="Par114">As mentioned, it would be useful to act on those risk factors that predispose patients to this progression. Lymphopenia appears to be the main factor implicated in this progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but in preventive terms it is desirable to intervene also because of a number of other factors. It is known that the progression of the pathology is also favored by the presence of several bacterial or fungal co-infections, often transmitted by visitors and family members who have not been properly informed about the preventive measures to be taken.</p><p id="Par115">In conclusion, control strategies should be implemented in the hospital environment given the limited efficacy of available therapies especially in immunocompromised subjects; preventive measures should be adopted and implemented as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced Digital Features</bold></p><p>To view digital features for this article go to 10.6084/m9.figshare.12497915.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec id="d30e1554"><title>Funding</title><p>No funding or sponsorship was received for the publication of this article.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1559"><title>Authorship</title><p>All named authors meet the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship for this article, take responsibility for the integrity of the work as a whole and have given their approval for this version to be published.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1564"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Francesco De Motoli, Federica Sandri, Maria Vittoria Toffoletto and Armando Stefanati declare that they have no conflict of interest.
