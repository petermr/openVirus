<p id="Par23">Molecular typing of HAdVs was performed via conventional PCR using specific primers targeting the complete coding sequences of the hexon, fiber, and penton genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Viral DNA was extracted from cultured medium using QIAamp RNA mini kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Conventional PCR was conducted using high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The hexon, fiber, and penton genes of HAdV were amplified as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For the hexon and penton genes, the PCR protocol was: 94 °C for 5 min., followed by 35 cycles of 50 s. at 94 °C, 50 s. at 55 °C, 3 min. at 72 °C, and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR protocol for amplification of fiber gene fragments was identical, except for the annealing temperature, which was 52 °C instead of 55 °C. The amplified PCR products were excised from agarose gels, purified using an Axyprep DNA gel extraction kit (Axygen, Hangzhou, China), and bi-directionally sequenced using the Sanger sequencing method by Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Invitrogen, Beijing, China) with an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX, USA).
