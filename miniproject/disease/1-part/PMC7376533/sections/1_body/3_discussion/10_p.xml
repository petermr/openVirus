<p id="Par49">Most of the mutations at the amino acid level in BJDX-01-2015 were observed in the coding regions of protein VI. During the replication of HAdVs, protein VI functions as an adaptor to shuttle the hexon protein to the nucleus, where virus assembly occurs [

Whether these variations affect the virulence of BJDX-01-2015 and are responsible for the milder clinical symptoms observed in this study requires further investigation. We also found that BJDX-01-2015 has different numbers of poly “T” and poly “A” tracts compared with other HAdV-B55, HAdV-B11, and HAdV-B14 strains. The role that poly “T” and poly “A” tracts play in the evolution of HAdVs remains unclear and requires further research.
