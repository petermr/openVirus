Disease models are necessary to understand neuropathogenesis and identify potential therapeutics and vaccines. Non-human primates have been used extensively but present major challenges. Advances have also been made toward the development of humanized mouse models, but these models still do not fully represent human pathophysiology. Recent developments in stem cell technology and cell culture techniques have allowed the development of more physiologically relevant human cell-based models. <italic>In silico</italic> modeling has also allowed researchers to identify and predict transmission patterns and discover potential vaccine and therapeutic candidates. This review summarizes the research on <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> models used to study three mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause neurological disease in humans: West Nile, Dengue, and Zika. We also propose a roadmap for 21st century research on mosquito-borne flavivirus neuropathogenesis, prevention, and treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mosquito-borne flavivirus</kwd><kwd>flaviviridae</kwd><kwd>Zika virus (ZIKV)</kwd><kwd>West Nile virus (WNV)</kwd><kwd>Dengue virus (DENV)</kwd><kwd>neuropathogenesis</kwd><kwd><italic>in vitro</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>in silico</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="248"/><page-count count="19"/><word-count count="17915"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFs) are geographically widespread viral infections and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Huang et al., <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Neurovirulent MBFs that have recently emerged in the Western world, such as Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and West Nile virus (WNV), deserve attention due to the unexpected high burden of associated neurological disease observed in affected regions (Sips et al., <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Mu&#x000f1;oz et al., <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). WNV was endemic in some regions in Europe, Asia and Africa where it caused sporadic outbreaks (Sambri et al., <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It emerged for the first time in America in 1999 and since has become the most widespread flavivirus that causes neurological disease globally (Chancey et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). One in 150 individuals infected by WNV experience a neurological disease characterized by encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, meningitis, and flaccid paralysis (Tsai et al., <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Chowers et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Mostashari et al., <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Mortality due to WNV encephalitis ranges between 10 and 17% and increases with age and immunosuppression state (Petersen et al., <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). DENV is the second most common mosquito-borne infection and is found in tropical and subtropical regions (Caraballo and King, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Neurological symptoms are typically observed in 4&#x02013;9% of infected subjects (Solomon et al., <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Pancharoen and Thisyakorn, <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Sahu et al., <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), though it has been documented as high as 21% of cases in some reports (Domingues et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). ZIKV is the most recent emerging MBF in the Americas. After its arrival in 2015, an increased incidence of microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS) in adults infected with ZIKV was reported (do Ros&#x000e1;rio et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Today, it is known that ZIKV causes fetal brain malformations and triggers GBS (Beckham et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>WNV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of infected patients with neurological symptoms (Huang et al., <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Carteaux et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) but the mechanism by which these viruses elicit a neurological effect remains unclear. Studies on the tropism of MBF and the associated histopathological changes following natural human infection have been reported. However, published results from human studies are limited and highly descriptive because they do not reflect the evolving dynamic between the host and the pathogen, which is crucial to understand the pathophysiology of these infections (Bearcroft, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>; Armah et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Because of the limited number of preclinical <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrating efficacy, clinical trials for MBF drug candidates are scarce. Several candidates of a human WNV vaccine have undergone pre-clinical testing mainly in mice, horses, and NHPs (Amanna and Slifka, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), but none has been licensed for use in humans. Clinical trials for ZIKV vaccines are still in the early stages. Only one MBF vaccine, CYD-TDV or &#x0201c;Dengvaxia,&#x0201d; a recombinant, chimeric, live attenuated tetravalent vaccine for DENV has been licensed. The manufacturing and licensing of antiviral drugs has also been challenging due to a lack of suitable models to evaluate novel agents. Supportive treatment is the current standard of care and most prevention strategies are focused on decreasing the exposure to the arthropod vectors responsible for the transmission of MBFs. The development of experimental models of neuropathogenesis following WNF and ZIKV infection has thus been a central focus in preclinical vaccine research and antiviral drug development of this virus (Chan et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, neuropathgogenesis of DENV is generally less well studies and not a focus of vaccine or anti-viral research.</p><p>Small rodents, birds, medium-sized mammals, and non-human primates (NHPs) have been used in MBF research (Kimura et al., <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Goodfellow et al., <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Maximova et al., <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). NHPs have traditionally been used to study human viruses because much of the host-specific pathophysiology is conserved between primates and humans. Protective efficacy of novel vaccines for MBFs has been demonstrated in primates for DENV (Guirakhoo et al., <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), WNV (Petersen et al., <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and ZIKV (Abbink et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but their efficacy in humans still needs to be corroborated (Torresi et al., <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Vannice et al., <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Primates also present maintenance challenges due to high cost and the strict requirements of high-containment biosafety facilities.</p><p>Mouse models are a more cost-effective and practical alternative to NHP models. The use of mouse models has resulted in a robust body of knowledge in MBF research, and this has been reviewed elsewhere (Clark et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, two main factors are recognized to influence the susceptibility of mice to MBF infection that limit applicability to humans: (1) immunocompetent wild-type mouse strains have been demonstrated to favor resistance to disease after peripheral inoculation with DENV and ZIKV (Clark et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zompi and Harris, <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), so immunocompromised mice (Dhole et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Oh et al., <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Kuszpit et al., <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), humanized mice (An et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), and mouse-adapted viral strains (Amorim et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Daniels et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) are used and (2) in mice, MBF infection via mosquito biting, the natural route of infection in humans, results in a lack of severe clinical manifestations (Styer et al., <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Cox et al., <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zompi and Harris, <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Moser et al., <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), so alternative routes of infection, such as subcutaneous (Smith et al., <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), intraocular (van den Pol et al., <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), intraperitoneal, intravenous (Xavier-Neto et al., <xref rid="B236" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and mucosal (Yockey et al., <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), have been used. Among those routes, intracranial inoculation has been used most, but it does not elicit the early peripheral immune response that occurs in humans (Kimura et al., <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Shao et al., <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).

Besides, there are other flaviviruses able to cause neurological diseases (such as Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis virus), and due to the size of the review search, we have focused this review on 3 of the main flavivirus with neurological pathology as an example of the flavivirus research. This review aims to summarize the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> research on DENV, WNV, and ZIKV and to define a roadmap for 21st century biomedical research on MBF neuropathogenesis, prevention, and treatment.</p><sec><title>Vaccine Research</title><p>There is a call to reduce the global burden of neurological disease caused by flavivirus. DENV continues its steady expansion and constitutes the most common mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. WNV is the most widespread flavivirus causing neurological disease in the world and exemplifies the potential transmission of flaviviruses outside tropical regions. ZIKV recently caused an unpredicted epidemic in the Americas is responsible for thousands of cases of microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Different strategies have been studied to limit the exposure to these infections and eradicate the occurrence of neurological involvement. Vector control has been explored with limited results. Therefore, vaccination is the mainstay intervention to prevent flavivirus infection.</p><p>Though an efficient WNV vaccine for humans is not available, vaccination of equine population has been a successful strategy to immunize control human transmission (Ng et al., <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; El Garch et al., <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This is possible because WNV primary reservoirs are birds and horses, while humans are dead-end hosts for the virus. WNV live attenuated vaccines are the most advanced and had efficiently passed phase II clinical trials (Biedenbender et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Subunit and DNA vaccines encoding E and prM proteins are also being developed. DNA vaccines have passed phase I clinical trials, showing safety and immunogenicity (Martin et al., <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ledgerwood et al., <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>The development of a DENV vaccine has been a complex task to accomplish for different reasons. First, there is no an adequate animal model that recapitulates human DENV infection. Second, DENV has four antigenically different serotypes, each with intrinsic genetic variation. The natural infection with one serotype confers long term immunity against the infecting serotype, but the humoral response fails to neutralize the other serotypes. Third, DENV heterotypic infections have been associated with an increased likelihood of severe clinical manifestations possibly attributed to an immune enhancement of the infection driven by cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies (Collins and Metz, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Due to these concerns the development of a DENV tetravalent vaccine has been the focus over the 21st century; this vaccine should elicit a rise long-lasting protective immunity against all the serotypes. Several phase I and II clinical trials have been completed using monovalent or tetravalent live attenuated (Edelman et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Sun et al., <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Wright et al., <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Capeding et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Poo et al., <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Leo et al., <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sabchareon et al., <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Durbin et al., <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Villar et al., <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Watanaveeradej et al., <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Bauer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; George et al., <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Dubey et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Whitehead et al., <xref rid="B229" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), DNA (Beckett et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), chimeric (Guirakhoo et al., <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and purified inactivated vaccines (Martinez et al., <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). CYD-TDV, a recombinant, chimeric, live attenuated vaccine is the only one licensed for individuals between 9 and 45 years in more than 10 endemic countries and has completed phase III clinical trials in Asia and Latin America (Capeding et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Villar et al., <xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>There are no approved vaccines against ZIKV infection. Tebas et al. conducted a phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the DNA vaccine (GLS-5700) which encodes the premembrane and envelope proteins in healthy individuals. The vaccine elicited anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies in 62% of the samples on a cellular assay (Tebas et al., <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). There are some phase I and II clinical trials on ZIKV vaccine. However, the preliminary results will be available a couple of years from now.</p><p>Achieving sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies, on the contrary, might increase the risk of an immunologically mediated severe disease. However, other vaccine platforms have also been tested since the early 90s.</p><p>The most recent clinical trial published in 2017, demonstrated safety of vaccination in individuals previously exposed to flavivirus. The TV003 vaccine was not associated with severe disease in this group (Whitehead et al., <xref rid="B229" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Immunogenicity of the tetravalent CYD-TDV vaccine was demonstrated in na&#x000ef;ve and seropositive patients to DENV infection in India in 2016 (Dubey et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In 2015, the re-derived, live attenuated, tetravalent dengue virus (TDEN) vaccine also demonstrated to be safety and immunogenic for in individual ranging from 1 to 50 years of age independently of a prior exposure to the infection in Puerto Rico (Bauer et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The same year, the DENV-1 purified inactivated vaccine was tested in flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve healthy adults in the United States, in which humoral response was effectively detected (Martinez et al., <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In 2015, the live attenuated tetravalent vaccine TDV demonstrated to be safe and induce anti-DENV neutralizing antibodies in flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve adults in the United States (George et al., <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In 2016, the WHO recommended the use of Dengvaxia, a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine, in regions with 70% of DENV seroprevalence. To date Dengvaxia is licensed in 11 countries for people age 9&#x02013;45 years.</p><p>Phase III trials have suggested high rate of protection among partial immune individuals, but high rates of hospitalizations in small children who were seronegative prior to the vaccination (Aguiar et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccination to Veterinary Population</title><p>Phase I clinical trials have been published to assess 2 DNA vaccines encoding the pre-membrane and the envelope glycoprotein of the NY99 strain of WNV, in 2007 and 2011 (Martin et al., <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ledgerwood et al., <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Both studies demonstrated safety and efficacy in inducing neutralizing antibodies in individuals who completed 2 or 3 doses of vaccination.</p><p>DENV vaccine development has been limited by the lack of animal models recapitulating the infection and the risks attributed to past exposure to DENV infections, other flaviviruses or similar vaccines.</p></sec><sec><title>Drugs</title><p>Human clinical trials have been used to assess no pharmacological strategies to prevent flavivirus infection. There are no current treatments available for DENV infection. In 2016, a clinical trial testing celgosivir, an endoplasmic reticulum alpha glucosidase inhibitor; failed to demonstrate antiviral efficacy (lower viremia) in Asia (Sung et al., <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> methods represent a valuable resource in this field.

For example, <italic>in vitro</italic> models have been used to study the effects of MBF on early stages of embryonic differentiation (Liang et al., <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), viral receptors (Tsai et al., <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Qian et al., <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Dang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), the interactions of different cell types during pathogenesis (Diniz et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Verma et al., <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bramley et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and the mechanism by which the blood brain barrier (BBB) becomes compromised (Roe et al., <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> methods have also proven useful in drug screening (Allen et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Astashkina et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and have potential to aid in the selection of drug candidates for future phases of drug development (Xu et al., <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Recently, a high-content screening platform to study possible antiviral candidates for ZIKV was developed, in which human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were treated, following ZIKV infection, with over 1,000 US FDA approved drugs and drug candidates (Zhou et al., <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Treatments were validated with more complex systems, such as human fetal-like forebrain organoid models and animal studies (Zhou et al., <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), which demonstrates that <italic>in vitro</italic> methods can aid in selection of drug candidates prior to the use of more complex methods, saving resources and time.</p><p>The majority (270/412 studies) of reviewed <italic>in vitro</italic> studies focused on DENV, followed by WNV (111/412 studies) and ZIKV (73/412 studies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). DENV is considered the most common mosquito-borne infection after malaria; therefore, it was expected that DENV would be the most studied MBF in the <italic>in vitro</italic> literature. There were fewer studies on ZIKV, which is understandable, because ZIKV outbreaks have only raised concern in recent years.</p><p>Several cell lines have been used to study MBFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The most common cell lines used to study MBFs <italic>in vitro</italic> were African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero cells, 106/412 studies), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, 94/412 studies), and mosquito Aedes albopictus clone C6/36 cells (86/412 studies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is because these three lines are often used to replicate viruses but not always to study pathogenesis, and often after replication, other cell systems or animal models are used (Azeredo et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Hasebe et al., <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; de Borba et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Gandini et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cell lines <bold>(A)</bold> and organs and systems <bold>(B)</bold> represented in the <italic>in vitro</italic> literature.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fcimb-09-00223-g0002"/></fig><p>The other cell lines which were prominent in the <italic>in vitro</italic> literature were primary cultures (mainly from mouse and human tissue, 82/412 studies) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs, 55/412 studies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Human PBMCs are a convenient source of human primary cells, because they can be obtained from both healthy volunteers and infected patients of all ages. These cells can also be used to study innate aspects of infection as well as the adaptive response to viral infection (Gunther et al., <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Correa et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Rattanamahaphoom et al., <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In addition, dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells can be derived from PBMCs for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of the human immune response and host-pathogen interactions (Libraty et al., <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Reis et al., <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gandini et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In the future, blood isolated cell cultures could be use for personalized medicine. For example, monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) isolated from cryopreserved PBMC have been used to study the activation of pDC after DENV infection and their potential antiviral role (Gandini et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, one of the problems with PBMCs is the high genetic variability in the subjects. For instance, interferon responses (which are important for MBF research) vary depending on the individual, genre, and even populations (Whitney et al., <xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>).</p><p>Stem cell-based models comprised only about 6% of the studies retrieved in this review (24/412 studies, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has increased in recent years, and it is expected that this will be reflected in MBF research soon. Many of the studies that used iPSC cells were developed to study ZIKV in 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> models of the brain, such as brain organoids, spheroids, or other organotypic cultures (Dang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Such models have emerged in response to new epidemics of ZIKV in the Americas and around the world as well as in response to the need for novel tools to study virus pathogenesis and identify potential drug candidates with more human-relevant systems to study MBF infection.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> literature was also categorized by organ or organ system studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Many studies focused on modeling the immune system, biological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Most of the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies utilized monolayer cultures (400/412 studies) and were performed on WNV and DENV, while only a few papers used 3D cultures (24/412 studies), and these were mostly focused on ZIKV (Cugola et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Dang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Wells et al., <xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Garcez et al., <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><sec><title>Models of Brain Pathology in MBF Infection</title><p>ZIKV, DENV, and WNV infection can lead to severe neurological problems. These include aseptic meningitis, febrile convulsions in children, encephalitis, and myelitis (Turtle et al., <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Thus, models of the brain to study neuropathogenesis of MBF infection are needed. However, the brain is the most complex organ in the human body, and it is difficult to adequately model human neurophysiology. MBF neuropathogenesis has mainly been studied in monolayer cultures of various brain cell-type cancer cell lines, such as neuro-2a (de Borba et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ho et al., <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), neuronal N18 (Su et al., <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Simanjuntak et al., <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), primary cultures (Lucas et al., <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Diniz et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Yoon et al., <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhu et al., <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and stem cell derived CNS cells (Shrestha et al., <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Retallack et al., <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Yoon et al., <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For example, a monolayer culture of primary microglia, astrocytes, and neurons isolated from a fetal human brain was used to understand the replicative properties of WNV in each cell population. It was determined that WNV mainly replicates in neurons and astrocytes and that following infection, both astrocytes and microglia were activated and produced cytokines and chemokines (Cheeran et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Over the last few years, we have seen an increase in the use of organotypic cell cultures (Pamies and Hartung, <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and specific models of the brain (Lancaster et al., <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Quadrato and Arlotta, <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Sloan et al., <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The recent outbreak of ZIKV has also generated an increase in the number of publications focused on brain models as a platform to study ZIKV (Cugola et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Dang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Nowakowski et al., <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Garcez et al., <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These models include neurospheres, brain organoids, 3D multilayer cultures of brain cell types, and brains-on-a-chip, among others. These 3D models can be generated through cell aggregation, by plating cells into an artificial or animal-derived extracellular matrix (ECM), such as a matrigel, or using a combination of methods. Cell aggregation can be accomplished with gravity (e.g., hanging drops and aggrewells) (Beauchamp et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), spinning using bioreactors (Qian et al., <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), or gyratory shaking (Pamies et al., <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Advanced cell culture technologies currently employed to develop <italic>in vitro</italic> models of the brain and blood-brain barrier.

In summary, 3D models have shown to better reproduce the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation than 2D cultures. This is achived via the spatial conformation of 3D models allowing higher differentiation, survival and interaction between cells. In the case of brain models, 3D models allow growing neurons to interact with other cells for a longer period, which in 2D cultures is not possible, since these cells cultures tend to detach. Moreover, more complex models have been generated, but this complexity leads to other issues, such as lower reproducibility and higher researcher skill demands.</p><p>Neurospheres and organoids are the most popular 3D cultures used to study viral infection (18/24 studies on 3D models). While neurospheres consist of one cell type, such as neural precursors, neurons, or other CNS cells (Garcez et al., <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), organoids present multiple cell types, and represent some aspect of organ structure and function (Dang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Nowakowski et al., <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Wells et al., <xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Sacramento et al., <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>The use of 3D models in MBF research has facilitated the study of mechanisms of MBF infection. For example, research using neurospheres of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and cerebral organoids has demonstrated that NPCs and radial glia are more susceptible to altered cell cycle and cell death following ZIKV infection (Cugola et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Dang et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Nowakowski et al., <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Xu et al., <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Garcez et al., <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Moreover, studies in cerebral organoids have shown that exposure to ZIKV at early stages of differentiation disrupts organoid expansion and fold formation (Li et al., <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Other cerebral organoid studies have shown that ZIKV targets and replicates in proliferating ventricular zone (VZ) apical progenitors, affecting NPC differentiation and leading to progenitor depletion, disruption of the VZ, impaired neurogenesis, and cortical thinning (Cugola et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gabriel et al., <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Organoids and neurospheres have also been used in drug development (Xu et al., <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and to explore the oncolytic potential of ZIKV (Zhu et al., <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Other iPSC-derived 3D models have also incorporated primary microglia cells to study flavivirus-microglia interaction in a multicellular system (Abreu et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). More complex models have the potential to better model human physiology than classical 2D <italic>in vitro</italic> models. In other fields, organoids have shown to be a novel tool for drug screening development for cancer (Weeber et al., <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), intestinal diseases (Liu et al., <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and others.</p><p>There are also new models of the human brain that are being developed that have not yet been applied to MBF research but have potential applications in the field, such as brain region-specific organoids characterized by multiple components that correspond to the structures of various brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex (Kadoshima et al., <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mariani et al., <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Pasca et al., <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Qian et al., <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), midbrain (Jo et al., <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Qian et al., <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and hypothalamus (Merkle et al., <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Sakaguchi et al., <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wang L. et al., <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Qian et al., <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, cerebral organoids (also called mini brains) were initially described by Knoblich's laboratory (Lancaster et al., <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This model presented intrinsic self-organizing processes which display a cellular organization similar to early stages of the developing human brain. These feature allow scientists to study important key events during early brain development. The new tridimensional structure allows higher cell to cell interaction and maturation of the model. For example, Pasca's group have reported a method for generating pyramidal neurons from hiPSCs in a 3D cerebral cortex&#x02013;like structure (Pasca et al., <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, due to the lack of vasculature, necrotic centers form with in these tissues when the spheroid size is larger than 500 &#x003bc;m. Therefore, other models which are smaller in size but less complexity, have also been developed. For example. BrainSpheres developed in Hartung's laboratory have been able to recapitulate some of the key processes during CNS differentiation (Pamies et al., <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This model does not present spatial self-organization, however, has shown to be highly reproducible and presents a very high level of glial maturity in comparison with other models; showing maturate oligodendrocytes and partial axonal myelination (Pamies et al., <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). There have also been different attempts to incorporate vascularization into the system to avoid hypoxia in the center of organoids (McGuigan and Sefton, <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Pham et al., <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Grebenyuk and Ranga, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Homan et al., <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, to date, vasculature formation has not been accomplished in 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> brain models.</p><p>In addition, less complex 3D organotypic cultures, such as multicellular spheres characterized by multiple cell types and more homogeneous structures that do not represent different brain regions (Von Tobel et al., <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Pamies et al., <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), also have potential utility in MBF drug screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Models of Biological Barriers</title><p>Brain endothelial cells are the most important barrier to prevent viral invasion and spread from the blood to the cerebral parenchyma. MBF infection frequently produces encephalitis, which requires crossing this blood-brain barrier (BBB). Two main types of <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB models have been developed: static (multilayer cultures, multicompartment cultures) and dynamic models (employing microfluidics) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Static models typically use 3D extracellular matrix platforms (Geltrex, Matrigel) and transwell plates, while dynamic models include a hollow fiber-based apparatus and/or microfluidic devices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Endothelial cell monolayers have been used widely with the purpose of studying pathophysiological changes that occur on the BBB. <italic>In vitro</italic> models of the BBB are not frequently used in the study of MBFs (seven studies on WNV, six studies on DENV, and only one study on ZIKV were retrieved in this literature review). Although the current volume of publications is low, BBB <italic>in vitro</italic> models are tremendously important to understanding MBF neuroinvasion. All the models identified in this literature review were static BBB models, but many other models that have recently been developed could be applied to MBF research (Brown et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Cho et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wolff et al., <xref rid="B233" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; van der Helm et al., <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Bang et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> BBB models have been used to study membrane integrity following DENV infection of endothelial cells, and these studies demonstrated an increase in vascular permeability after DENV infection (Dewi et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Talavera et al., <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In addition, DENV has been demonstrated to induce IL-6 and IL-8 production in human umbilical vein endothelial Cells (HUVECs), and these cytokines were found to produce apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> in the ECV304 human umbilical cord vein endothelial cell line (Avirutnan et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>).</p><p>Endothelial cells have also been used to study WNV (Verma et al., <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Roe et al., <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The majority of papers retrieved involving BBB and WNV employed simplistic, monolayer cultures of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVEs). Although more complex systems are needed to better reproduce human physiology, these classical BBB models can help to confirm or hypothesize the virus' mechanism of infection (Verma et al., <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) or pathogenesis (Durrant et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Roe et al., <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Lazear et al., <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>ZIKV presented a limited bibliography, with only one paper for <italic>in vitro</italic> BBB models. In this study, HBMECs were grown in a rotating bioreactor to develop a human 3D cell-based model of the BBB microvascular endothelium characterized as a sphere of endothelial cells with a cavity inside (Bramley et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Infection studies using this model demonstrated that ZIKV did not easily infect the HBMEC model, but that exposure to TNF-&#x003b1; could enhance infection (Bramley et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). ZIKV has also been studied using models of other biological barriers, such as the blood-testis barrier (Siemann et al., <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and the umbilical barrier (Jacobs and Levin, <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Raekiansyah et al., <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Models of the Immune System</title><p>Sometimes, pathogens can compromise the BBB and enter the brain producing an inflammatory response, which typically involves the activation of microglia, the resident mononuclear phagocytes of the brain (Ginhoux et al., <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Microglia are responsible for the production of cytokines and other molecules that regulate inflammation and other homeostatic responses in brain, and these conditions can lead to brain diseases (Dheen et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). There are also other cells in the CNS that interact with the immune system such oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, perivascular macrophages and some types of neurons. These cells produce cytokines and chemokines that interact with the immune system under inflammatory response.</p><p>The immune system consists of complex interactions of a variety of cells, including monocytes, leukocytes, dendritic cells, platelets, and stem cells, among others. PBMCs are the most commonly used because human blood is a very convenient cell source that can be stored easily. Although PBMCs consist of a mixed population of blood leukocytes, they can also be used as a primary souce to futher purification of specific cell types (e.g., T cells, B cells) (Reis et al., <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wu et al., <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Rawle et al., <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zhang J. et al., <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Rattanamahaphoom et al., <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Immune system models found in this literature review were mainly used to study DENV, with fewer studies found for WNV or ZIKV. Most <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on MBF infection and the immune system were focused on viral molecular mechanisms. However, a few papers were focused on neuroinflammation. For example, human macrophages were used to study the role of Sema7, a membrane-associated/secreted protein that plays an essential role in connecting the vertebrate neuronal and immune systems in WNV pathogenesis (Sultana et al., <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The majority of papers studying neuroinflammation are <italic>ex vivo</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> models. There is therefore an urgent need to generate better <italic>in vitro</italic> models that represent the complex relationships between the brain and immune system and that can more accurately model neuroimmune responses. The development of new <italic>in vitro</italic> brain models incorporating microglia have the potential to become an important tool to study neuroinflammation following MBF infection. For example, recently microglia have been incorporate into a 3D iPSC derived model in order to study inflammation after ZIKV infection (Abreu et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, integrating the wider, peripheral immune system with the brain remains one of the major challenges for <italic>in vitro</italic> technologies.</p><p>Overall, <italic>in vitro</italic> models have proved to be a useful tool to study MBF, with examples that study virus molecular mechanisms (Correa et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Londono-Renteria et al., <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Rattanamahaphoom et al., <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), their implication in the inflammatory response (Lim et al., <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Duran et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), drug screening (Stolp et al., <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wang L.

Thus, human cell-derived <italic>in vitro</italic> models could present a solution to modeling MBF infection and neuropathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title><italic>In silico</italic> Studies</title><p>Efficient clinical translation of basic research findings is of paramount importance to protecting public health with regard to outbreaks of MBF infections. However, the traditional approach to development and testing of new biomedical products using <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies in the early stages of pre-clinical drug development can be time consuming and prohibitively expensive. <italic>In silico</italic> methods allow researchers to interpret large amounts of biological data efficiently, reduce costs, and speed up the early stages of drug development. The use of <italic>in silico</italic> modeling tools in MBF research has already aided in the identification of disease transmission patterns, allowed researchers to predict risk factors associated with the spread of MBF infection, and molecular modeling has advanced the mechanistic understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level as well as allowed researchers to identify potential vaccine candidates and therapeutic strategies. Such studies represent promising advancements in the field of MBF research and indicate great potential for an efficient, inexpensive, comprehensive, and mechanistically-driven drug candidate identification process.</p><p>In this literature review, <italic>in silico</italic> modeling and other computational techniques were shown to be valuable to MBF research and a promising direction for the field moving forward. <italic>In silico</italic> studies retrieved in the literature review were categorized by applicability to MBF type (DENV, ZIKV, WNV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The majority of <italic>in silico</italic> studies were focused on DENV (180/253 studies), followed by WNV (75/253 studies), and ZIKV (66/253 studies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). There were also studies labeled with more than one MBF type because many of the <italic>in silico</italic> models (39/253 studies) were found to have general applicability to all or many types of flaviviruses (e.g., studies based on models of a shared protein structure or transmission dynamics modeling of a vector host species which carries more than one type of MBF). The <italic>in silico</italic> literature was also sorted by study objective into the following categories: vector control, vaccine development, transmission dynamics, antiviral therapy development, mosquito-virus interactions, or human pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Most studies were labeled as either antiviral therapy development studies (99/253 studies) or transmission dynamics studies (91/253 studies), followed by vaccine development studies (24/253), vector control studies (23/253 studies), human pathogenesis research (22/253 studies), and mosquito-virus interaction studies (4/253 studies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><sec><title>Antiviral Therapy Development Studies</title><p>Antiviral agents for MBF infection have generally been designed to inhibit viral entry, replication, or the host factors that permit viral infection. Thus, much of the computational virology literature on antiflaviviral drug development has focused on molecular modeling of the structures that play a role in these processes, such as the viral envelope, capsid, and enzymes, as well as the interacting host factors, in order to determine the optimal targets for drug development, screen compounds for potential antiviral activity, and identify the most promising therapeutic candidates for further testing.</p><p>A number of studies focused on <italic>in silico</italic> screening of potential inhibitory compounds that bind with high affinity to either the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) methyltransferase (MTase) domain (Milani et al., <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Podvinec et al., <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Stephen et al., <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) or the RNA dependent RNA polymerase domain of DENV (Anusuya et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Elfiky, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Manvar et al., <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), both of which play key roles in viral replication within host cells. In addition, many <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking studies have been instrumental in screening compounds that target either the NS3 helicase domain that unwinds the viral RNA for genome replication, or the protease domain that cleaves viral precursor proteins (Pambudi et al., <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Parida et al., <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Wichapong et al., <xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Mukhametov et al., <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Viswanathan et al., <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Dwivedi et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Shiryaev et al., <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). There have also been studies which focus on screening a particular class of drug candidate for potential binding to and neutralizing of many key viral enzymes, such as the recent study in which phytochemicals were screened for their binding affinity to the structures of the ZIKV protease, helicase, methyltransferase, and polymerase (Byler et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>The structural proteins of the viral envelope are also important targets to explore in antiflaviviral drug discovery as a strategy to inhibit viral entry into host cells. Many studies have developed molecular docking approaches to screen compounds for their ability to bind to the viral envelope proteins of DENV (Li et al., <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Zhou et al., <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Yennamalli et al., <xref rid="B240" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Computational approaches have been used to build on naturally occurring DENV sequences, predicting novel peptide structures that display increased target binding affinity and improved inhibition of viral binding and entry while maintaining low host cell toxicity (Costin et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). More recently, a homology model of the ZIKV envelope protein was resolved, and a simulation-based approach was used to identify the binding sites of potential small molecule inhibitors (Fernando et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). There are also host factors that play a role in viral infection and can be targeted in antiviral therapy. <italic>In silico</italic> approaches have been used for virtual screening of small molecule inhibitors of the human helicase X-linked DEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3), a protein which interacts with viral proteins and allows viral replication to occur within host cells (Fazi et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>In silico</italic> methods have also been used following <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> testing to elucidate the mode of action or binding site of particular antiviral candidates. For example, structure modeling was used to demonstrate that a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes DENV and WNV <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse studies binds to the fusion loop peptide of the flavivirus envelope protein (Deng et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and to confirm <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that an antiviral compound binds to and inhibits the DENV capsid protein (Scaturro et al., <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Structure-activity relationships have also been used to identify the inhibitory functional groups of a DENV NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitor identified with cell culture experiments (Tomlinson and Watowich, <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and molecular modeling of antimalarial compounds was used to understand the stereo-electronic properties that allowed these compounds to also confer DENV antiviral activity in cell culture (Balasubramanian et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>A number of <italic>in silico</italic> studies on antiflavivirals have been used to inform further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> testing. For example, molecular modeling of the protease-inhibitor complex of potential ZIKV antivirals was used to identify structural scaffolds for allosteric small-molecule inhibitors of the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease, and the most potent inhibitors were then tested both <italic>in vitro</italic> in human fetal neural progenitor cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice and found to demonstrate inhibition of ZIKV propagation (Shiryaev et al., <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the recent computational studies on antiviral drug candidates demonstrate the potential of <italic>in silico</italic> tools to aid in the rational design of antiflavivirals, identify pharmaceutically relevant drug targets, and accelerate the process of antiflaviviral drug development. A good example of such trend is the OpenZika project, in which components of a software system are shared among multiple sources (i.e., distribures computing) to screen potential anti-ZIKV compounds with increased efficiency, using publicly accessible data (Ekins et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Moreover, studies on naturally infected patients could aid in the investigation of biological samples other than blood that could be used to diagnose MBF infection and elucidate MBF reservoirs (e.g., urine in ZIKV infection).</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Problems and possible solutions for MBF research.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Study type</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Problems</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Solutions</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Human</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Difficult to study progression of disease</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Development of multidisciplinary networks (health care workers, virologists, epidemiologists) that work together with local registries to improve disease surveillance following flavivirus infection.</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Restricted access to pathological studies</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Development of biobanks of samples obtained from sick patients in different stages of disease.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased prospective controlled studies in naturally infected population.</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>In vivo</italic></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Human relevance</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Use or combine <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with <italic>in silico</italic> or human <italic>in vitro</italic> models.</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cost</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Combination with computational and <italic>in vitro</italic> models</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>In vitro</italic></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reproducibility</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Increased rigor and application of GCCP</p></list-item><list-item><p>Standardization of <italic>in vitro</italic> methods</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Human relevance</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Use of more complex systems (organoids, microfluidic organ-on-chips, etc.)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of primary human cells</p></list-item></list></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>In silico</italic></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Often needs validation using other methods (<italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Produce better predictive models</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increase confidence in models</p></list-item></list></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Although NHPs have been used extensively to study MBFs, many of the potential vaccine and antiviral drugs that were successful in NHP preclinical research have failed in human clinical trials (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Other animal models, such as mice, have also been used as a low cost alternative to NHPs, and procedures exist to humanize mice to increase their susceptibility to infection. However, both mouse models and NHPs are still limited in their physiological relevance, and thus, results from these studies may not translate to human clinical studies. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> models have potential to overcome the limitations and ethical concerns associated with <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies, but these methods also present unique challenges. <italic>In vitro</italic> models have been used in many MBF studies to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying infection and pathogenesis. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> models that rely on cancer cell lines or monolayer cultures are limited in human relevance. Stem cell-derived models should be considered optimal human cell sources, together with primary human cell cultures and peripheral blood samples when possible, and GCCP should always be practiced (Coecke et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Pamies and Hartung, <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In addition, novel cell culture systems, such as spheroids, organoids, microfluidic systems, and bioprinted multi-layered cultures that allow the study of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in a 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> environment have demonstrated potential to increase the physiological relevance of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.</p><p>Overall, <italic>in silico</italic> methods have proven to be valuable resources in MBF research, to design and screen large libraries of potential antiviral and vaccine candidates as well as model host-pathogen interactions and study potential mechanisms of infection and transmission dynamics. <italic>In silico</italic> models can play a major role in research on the prevention of MBF infection through vector control and provide a better understanding of MBF transmission factors and patterns that lead to widespread MBF outbreaks. In addition, <italic>in silico</italic> modeling and high throughput screening of therapeutic or preventative drug candidates followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> validation has potential to speed up the process of MBF drug development.</p><p>Thus, far, both <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> methods have primarily been developed to generate preliminary data that would typically be followed by <italic>in vivo</italic> testing to validate findings. This significantly reduces the amount of animal testing required for MBF research but does not completely replace animal testing. In the long-term, it would be advantageous to further develop <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> methods with the goal of replacement in mind, because often, preclinical success in animal models does not translate to efficacy in human clinical trials, and failure in an animal model does not necessarily indicate a lack of human efficacy. Logically, the failure of certain drugs or vaccines when moving from <italic>in vitro</italic> to pre-clinical <italic>in vivo</italic> or from pre-clinical animal models to humans is often a function of specific pharmacological properties of potential drugs, and replacing animal models will require additional novel <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in silico</italic> approaches that can accurately predict bioavailability and stability of drug candidates. However, a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> methods have the potential to bridge this translational gap between preclinical and clinical research, and more integrated approaches combining or linking different studies and methods are essential to better understand the mechanism of MBF infection and resulting diseases and improve the drug development process.</p><p>We envision a future of MBF research with less reliance on NHP and rodent models and an increase in the number and rigor of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> studies. The emergence of new technologies (e.g., induced pluripotent stem cell models, organotypic cultures, and high throughput <italic>in silico</italic> screening) will help to better predict human pathogenesis and drug efficacy. We believe that harmonization of methods and centralization of data, together with combining different approaches to reach a common objective, are crucial to better understand MBF infection and neuropathogenesis and obtain clinical solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>The literature review and classification of the papers were done by MC, LM, GH, DF, and DP.
