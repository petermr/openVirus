<p>Climate change can be directly or indirectly detrimental to human health. To date, a majority of the investigations were confined to direct effects of climate change; for instance, heatwaves, floods, drought, hurricane, cyclone and other extreme weather events [

Climate change can alter environmental temperature, wind, and precipitation patterns, which can indirectly affect pathogen distribution, vector reproduction rates, and transmission media. These effects then further determine regional shifts in seasonal patterns of individual diseases along with its respective frequency and severity. In this section, the impacts of climate change over infectious diseases have been systematically surveyed primarily over impacts on pathogens, vectors or hosts, and mode of transmission. Empirical findings related to pathogens, vectors and associated diseases are summarized in
