<p>A key element for pathogen transmission and their spatiotemporal occurrence is the Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP). EIP specifically refers to the time interval between ingestion of pathogen by the fly from an infected person and the release of the same pathogen while feeding another person, thereby causing multiplication and propagation of complex sexual cycles [

Contrary to this, at lower temperatures, EIP duration can be longer than fly life expectancy and therefore, even with abundant vector populations, the pathogen transmission cycles can cease.
