<p>Wind can play an important role in the transmission of air-borne pathogens and viruses. Wind storms and other similar calamities hold great potential for transmission of viruses and pathogens from endemic regions to other distant regions. As an example, it has been proved that Asian Dust Storms (ADS) were involved in a widespread transmission of the H1N1 influenza virus [

One example related to all species of mosquitoes is that strong winds can significantly minimize biting opportunities but also provide aid in spatial distribution, thereby increasing disease transmission probability [
