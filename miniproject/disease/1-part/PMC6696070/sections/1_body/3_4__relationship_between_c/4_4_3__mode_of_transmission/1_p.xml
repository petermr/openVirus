<p>Disease transmission can be categorized as direct and indirect transmission. Direct transmission to humans basically includes transmission through physical contact, droplet transfer, and by using infected formites. Indirect transmission to humans mostly occurs with the involvement of vectors or other organisms. Past studies have shown a positive involvement of climate variables and extreme weather conditions in the transmission of diseases, although the transmission mechanism is not well understood yet. This subsection discusses the impacts and consequences of climate change on the transmission of diseases in humans. </p>
