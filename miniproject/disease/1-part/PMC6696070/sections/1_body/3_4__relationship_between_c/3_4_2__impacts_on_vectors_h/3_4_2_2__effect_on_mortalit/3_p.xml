<p>Precipitation can play a dual role in the distribution of disease vectors, although most of the vector growth accelerates during rainfalls with increasing temperature [

 <xref rid="B106-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. However, excessive precipitation can have adverse impacts on larvae growth, as heavy rain may mop off their breeding sites [

 <italic>Culex,</italic> a mosquito genus which carries the West Nile virus, generally breeds in grubby water pools and drains. Heavy rainfall can wash off the drains, thereby limiting the growth of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and hence reducing transmission of the West Nile virus [

 <italic>Anopheles,</italic> which mostly breeds in clean and stagnant water, were significantly affected by drought due to a severe reduction in breeding sites [
 <xref rid="B108-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Contrary to this, another study on the impact of drought highlighted a reduction in the flow of water in brooks, which ultimately introduces small pools and patches of putrid water that act as perfect breeding sites [
