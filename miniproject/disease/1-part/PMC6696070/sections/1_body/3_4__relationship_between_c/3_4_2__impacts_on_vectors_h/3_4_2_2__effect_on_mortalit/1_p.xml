<p>Temperature mostly has a direct influence on the mortality rate of vectors; however, the limited understanding and complexity of the relationship between vectors, disease transmission, and surrounding environment urge more detailed research [

 <xref rid="B98-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. For instance, a study conducted in Changsha, China, identified that a temperature of 22–23 °C is optimal for the development of mosquito larvae, while 25–26 °C is suitable for JEV, as it exceeds the breeding temperature, and the tendency of being infected also rises significantly [

 <xref rid="B100-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. These larval and pupal stages of dipteran vectors are more sensitive to diurnal variations in regional temperature than global variation in temperatures [

However, there are two major factors which determine the probability of vector population survival in the geographical regions where climatic conditions surpasses the threshold limits: (a) the capacity and tendency of the vector to espy refuge from extreme conditions; (b) capacity of surrounding environment or vector habitat to provide opportunities for refuges [
