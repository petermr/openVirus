<p>Among most of the positive effects of extreme climatic conditions on vector’s mortality, there are some vectors whose growth are restricted, thereby a reduction can be observed in the distribution of disease vectors. For instance, viruses responsible for yellow fever and dengue are carried and transmitted by the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito [

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> larvae ceases when the temperature of habitat water exceeds 34 °C. Moreover, as the air temperature reaches 40 °C, the adult 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> concentration also starts to collapse [

 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> may vanish in regions where temperature surpasses their thresholds. Another example includes the case of the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito, vector for 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, a causative agent of malaria. These mosquito vectors can only survive above 16 °C, thereby on dropping the temperature below it aids control measures over malaria epidemics [
