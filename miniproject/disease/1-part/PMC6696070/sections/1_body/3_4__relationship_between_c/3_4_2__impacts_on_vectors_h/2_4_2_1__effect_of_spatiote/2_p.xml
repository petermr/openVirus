<p>Ticks, another disease-transmitting vector, is found to be greatly affected by global warming in terms of survival and reproduction rates largely due to increase in winter temperatures [

These studies highlighted that the expansions were mainly due to milder winters and extended spring and autumn seasons along with some adverse human activities such as decimation of forest and over exploitation of coal and petroleum reserves, which ultimately promote global warming.
