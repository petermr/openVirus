<p>Climate change can also significantly influence the precipitation pattern and humidity level, which in turn could provide a beneficial environment for some water-borne and air-borne disease pathogens. Considerable rain after dry periods can cause a potential outbreak of diseases due to the development of a variety of pathogens [
