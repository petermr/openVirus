<p>Pathogens refer to a broad variety of disease-causing agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microorganisms, and parasites. Till date, there are more than 1400 known species of human pathogens. These pathogens are mostly transmitted to humans either zoonotically (60%) or other environmental mediums (~10%). Zoonotically transmitted pathogens require an animal body as their habitat for survival. The remaining pathogens can be directly transmitted human-to-human [

Indirectly, it can affect by influencing the environment, particularly their habitat. Therefore, climate change can potentially enhance quantity and can also induce a major shift in the distribution of pathogens [
