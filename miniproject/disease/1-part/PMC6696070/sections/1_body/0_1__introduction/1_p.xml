<p>Climate change is a significant statistical shift in regional or global climate variables over a considerable period of time (decades or even more). The most sensitive climatic variables include precipitation pattern, humidity, average and peak temperatures, and wind [

Moreover, a remarkable rise of 1.5 °C to 5.8 °C in global mean temperature was predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the 21st century, accompanied by more severe weather events dominated by floods and droughts [
