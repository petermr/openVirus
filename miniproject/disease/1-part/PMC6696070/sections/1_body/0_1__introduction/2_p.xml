<p>Climatic variations can significantly influence human health through the emergence of various infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Pathogens, vectors, and favorable transmission conditions are the three essential components involved in most infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Optimum climatic conditions are a prerequisite for reproduction, survival, mortality, and spatiotemporal distribution of vectors and disease-causing pathogens. Therefore, a sudden or long-term climate change can have a positive impact over infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Numerous studies have divulged the continual impact of rising rates of warming on the geographic expansion of pathogen-based diseases [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Studies also have found that increased global temperature boosted skin-related diseases [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. More cases and hospital admissions have been reported regarding cutaneous injuries from marine and aquatic organisms that have expanded their habitats due to favorable warm water environments, such as cercarial dermatitis, jellyfish envenomation and melioidosis [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, extreme weather events can also motivate the emergence and re-emergence of clustered diseases in many other non-traditional regions [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conclusively, climatic conditions modulate the seasonal and geographic distribution of vector-borne diseases, and weather influences the severity and timing of disease outbreaks [
