<p>Among all the mitigation measures for reducing the vulnerability of health risks associated with climate change, improved public health system and quality infrastructure are most significant [

Their inefficient public health systems in terms of resources, infrastructure and capabilities are the major cause of minimal resistance towards elevated health risks. It was the below par performance of public health services and lack of anti-malaria spraying that caused more than 75,000 cases of malaria after a hurricane incidence in 1963 in Haiti [

A striking increase in a group of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, measles, typhoid, malaria and paratyphoid fever were found after five months of hurricane calamity in Dominican Republic in 1979. It was believed that the major causes were crowded dwellings, poor sanitation, unhygienic food and water, and low immunization rates [
