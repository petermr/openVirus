<p>The following three levels of practices need to be adapted for successful vindication of adverse impacts of climate change on disease occurrence: (a) improved and stringent policies must be implemented to reduce carbon emission by utilizing renewable resources and to promote carbon utilization by employing carbon dioxide sequestration technologies such as bio-sequestration or chemical sequestrations technologies, (b) detailed research is needed to identify all possible acquaintances between climatic variables and the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases, (c) appropriate infrastructure with improved public health systems should be available to successfully encounter adverse outcomes at the regional, state and national levels. We hope that the present review work can provide a cause for more multi-disciplinary projects and collaborations, which can converge the gap in understanding the complicated relationship between climate change and induced health risk.</p>
