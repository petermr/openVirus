<p>Many studies have been conducted on the consequences of global and regional weather events on human diseases, as depicted in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02799-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Majority of these studies are empirical rather than comprehensive. They lack the real mechanism between climate change and various diseases and often contradict each other. As an example, a study by Nicholls revealed that in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, the outburst of malaria was due to heavy rainfall caused by an El Nino event around 1983 [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Another study found a sudden downfall in malaria cases in regions of the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania after the 1998 El Nino event. Similar contradictions were found for the case of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemics. In the dry grassland regions of East Africa, heavy rainfall was found responsible for the epidemics of RVF [

 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, in Kenya, no association was identified between El Nino and RVF and also no correlation was noted between heavy rainfall variability and El Nino [
