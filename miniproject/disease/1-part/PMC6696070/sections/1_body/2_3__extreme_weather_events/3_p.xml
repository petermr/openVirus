<p>Many researchers have claimed climate change to contribute to cardiopulmonary disorders such as acute coronary syndromes, infarction and other similar mortalities [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,

 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although climate change may seem to provide some health benefits (in early stages) in such disorders [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], they pose much more health hazards. A warmer climate produces much intense heat waves on a frequent basis, the negative effects on which on human health are well-known [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Incidences of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in children as well as in adults have increased tremendously from the last century [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A close relationship had been found between hospital admission, environmental temperature, and humidity for angina pectoris [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Another research in the US revealed that humidity with higher temperatures resulted in an increment of asthma patients’ visits to hospitals [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Numerous model projects based on the climate in Europe and North America provided evidence for 50% increment in intensity and frequency of hottest days in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the US, more than 400 deaths are reported annually due to excessive heat-related sickness [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Recent studies also confirmed the association between higher temperature and myocardial infarction along with congestive heart failure due to excessive heat [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A detailed understanding of change in climate patterns and combined climate effects on human health is highly desirable. This not only provides support in predicting health effects from weather-related events but also plays a potential role in effectively controlling many diseases.
