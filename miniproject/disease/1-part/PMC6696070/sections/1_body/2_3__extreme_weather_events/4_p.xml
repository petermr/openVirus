<p>Variations in the magnitude of weather events might also be responsible for a variety of health effects. For example, a study conducted by Chen et al. found that cases of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) increased during the floods in 1954, 1975 and 1991, implicating HFRS with floods directly [

Finally, further research revealed that the rodent population was ultimately responsible for HFRS, which reduced greatly in regions affected by floods in 1998. A similar kind of study was performed by Pan et al. in which the main reason for HFRS was related to variable water levels in flooded areas [

 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The aftereffects of those events on human health were seen as a widespread increase of malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, and cholera. Lastly, heat and drought are mainly responsible for wildfire in many parts of the world. Smoke from wildfires can cover a wide area exposing people to hazardous gases and particulate matters [

 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The above examples illustrate the lack of enough data as well as contradictions among studies, highlighting the limited ability to predict diseases and any change related to their course or intensity during different weather events. Hence, there is the utmost requirement to accurately predict all possible changes in climate variables that are expected to be associated with extreme weather events.
