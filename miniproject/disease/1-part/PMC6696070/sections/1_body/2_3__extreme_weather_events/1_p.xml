On a broader basis, these events can be categorized as global scale extreme events like El Nino, La Nina and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), and regional scale events such as floods, droughts, and shift in precipitation and drought.

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Extreme weather events may not only result in the huge spread of diseases through the increased growth of vectors, pathogens, viruses, and transmission routes, but can also cause a breakdown of public health infrastructure, loss of sanitation and hygiene, shortage of drinking water supply, and increased concentration of people.
