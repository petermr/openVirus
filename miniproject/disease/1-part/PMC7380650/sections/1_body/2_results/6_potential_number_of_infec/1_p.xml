<p>Once the yearly attack rate was calculated, we estimated the potential number of infected people (

Areas with epidemic potential for ZIKV affected 24.7% of the mean yearly number of blood donations from the ten UCLs, with the greatest average number of donations residing in Brisbane (171,727) followed by Townsville (23,600), Cairns (9,273), Rockhampton (6,904) and Darwin (5,685). Cairns, Rockhampton and Townsville represented only 4.5% of the annual mean number of blood donations in the studied UCLs. Thursday Island did not have any recorded donors. Regarding the potential number of infected products and subsequent risk for blood safety, there was no substantial risk identified with the best-case scenario, while the risk was extremely low with the worst-case scenario. The highest estimate of predicted likelihood of infection in blood components were from donations in Darwin [one in 992,681 with
