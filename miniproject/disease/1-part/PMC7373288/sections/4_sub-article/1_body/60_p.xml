<p>Minor comment #4: In the discussion Section, I’m not convinced that discrepancies between studies can be explained by the different algorithms used. I understood that the percent gives for the studies are % of resistance mutations not resistance to drugs. The difference in the list of mutations used in the different algorithms is marginal.</p>
