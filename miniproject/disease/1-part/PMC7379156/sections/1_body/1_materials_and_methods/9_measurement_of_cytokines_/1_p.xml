<p>Pancreas, spleen, ovaries, uterus, blood, and peritoneal cavity fluids were harvested 24 h or 4 days after intraperitoneal infection with 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu WSN. Each tissue was homogenized using Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen). The supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The samples were then serially diluted in assay diluent buffer, and the amounts of cytokines and chemokines were measured using the Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytokine Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, United States. Catalog No: 560485) and the LEGENDplex
 <sup>TM</sup> Mouse Proinflammatory Chemokine Panel (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, United States. Catalog No: 740451) in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions. The CBA Mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 Cytokine Kit contained capture beads to measure the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, TNF, and IFN-γ. The Mouse Proinflammatory Chemokine Panel consists of two sets of beads: Beads A classification, RANTES (CCL5), MIP3-alpha (CCL20), Eotaxin (CCL11), TARC (CCL17), KC (CXCL1), and MCP-1 (CCL2); Beads B classification, MIG (CXCL9), IP-10 (CXCL10), MIP-1alpha (CCL3), MIP-1beta (CCL4), BLC (CXCL13), LIX (CXCL5), and MDC (CCL22). After incubation with the capture beads and detection reagents, the samples were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience) and quantified using the LEGENDplex
 <sup>TM</sup> software, version 7.0 (BioLegend).
