 <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that causes an illness with debilitating muscle and joint pain. CHIKV has infected millions in a continued wave of outbreaks worldwide. Despite this, there are no approved antivirals or vaccines against CHIKV infection. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors against CHIKV. A panel of proteasome inhibitors was found to reduce CHIKV titres in CHIKV-infected cells. We selected bortezomib, an FDA-approved drug, for further investigation into its antiviral mechanism. We confirmed the anti-CHIKV effects of bortezomib using different cell lines and CHIKV strains. We found that bortezomib resulted in a major decrease in levels of CHIKV structural proteins, which are involved in formation of progeny virus particles. Bortezomib treatment also prominently increased synthesis of viral replicase components and increased CHIKV RNA synthesis. We propose that proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib are likely to inhibit CHIKV through various mechanisms that ultimately lead to a decrease in structural proteins and infectious viral progeny. This study suggests that proteasome inhibitors display a potential for further development as antivirals against CHIKV infection and may be useful tools to study CHIKV molecular biology and virus-host interactions.</p>
