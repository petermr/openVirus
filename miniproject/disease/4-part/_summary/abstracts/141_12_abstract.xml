 <p>This article summarizes current knowledge on the related influenza B and C viruses and considers the few studies on the recently identified influenza D virus. We focus on the particular viral genome organizations, the viral propagation cycles, as well as structural and functional insight into the encoded viral gene products. This is complemented with comprehensive sections that address the evolutionary strategies and the epidemiological significance of these influenza virus types, as well as the current state of interventions available for their control.</p>
