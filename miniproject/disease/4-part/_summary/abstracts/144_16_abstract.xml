 <p>Increasing emergence and spread of Nipah, ZIKV and Ebola case and potential outbreaks threats have been reported in several regions around the globe. Yet, emerging Nipah, Ebola and Zika viral diseases outbreaks have been indirectly linked to substantially globalization of trade and travel, climate change and intense urbanization impact, healthcare and socioeconomic inequities as well in affected community settings. Although no case has been documented in Saudi Arabia, there is a great risk of sudden emergence of any of these viruses and others via introducing among pilgrims coming from endemic regions during ritual ceremonies of mass gatherings. Consequently, promoting and investing on new and sensitive proven effective and innovative surveillance and monitoring approaches, including enhanced risk communication, improved integrated vectors surveillance in addition to improved sustainable highly pathogens surveillance control programs to human motility and environmental sanitation strategies all represent ‘One Health’ approach implementation strategic core. Initiation, development and implementation leaded by Saudi government and international stakeholders’ of new partnership, coordinated response leadership and resource mobilization for multidisciplinary and intersectorial advocacy on emerging viral disease outbreaks, accompanied with R&amp;D roadmap and taskforce is crucial. More efforts in epidemiological and laboratory early screening and surveillance of highly pathogenic germs/microbes, and confirmation of asymptomatic and syndromic cases amongst suspected Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, local vulnerable populations and expatriate workers is vital in generating reliable data and data sharing platform for timely risk communication and tourist information update, appropriate immunization campaigns or safe and efficacious care delivery implementation. Moreover, increase Hajj/Umrah mass gathering emergency outbreak preparedness, pilgrims health education and engagement outreach, pre-, during and post programs coverage and effectiveness is needed through One Health approach integration in attaining pilgrims and local population health safety and security, in advancing Saudi sustainable health development goals.</p>
