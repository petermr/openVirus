 <p>Hospital wastewater contains various pharmaceuticals and pathogens. Improper management of the wastewater has caused the leakage of these harmful materials to the environment. The presence of pathogens, pharmaceuticals, and their derivatives such as antibiotic resistance genes as the most typical one in the environment leads to physical, chemical, and biological harmful impact. This chapter has reviewed the pharmaceuticals and pathogens in the hospital; discussed the development of antibiotic resistance genes; and revealed the possible impact of these harmful materials in microorganisms, organism, and human being. In addition, the measures that can be taken to prevent the transportation of pharmaceuticals and pathogens into environment have been stated in this chapter.</p>
