 <p>The dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses have tremendously expanded their geographic range during recent decades and are now considered emerging threats in temperate areas. The increase in international travel and trade appear to be major factors, encouraging both a circulation of these viruses on a global scale and the dispersion of one of their main vectors: 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, the tiger mosquito. However, these two factors cannot fully explain the risk of viral emergence in temperate areas. Climatic factors, land cover, socioeconomic characteristics and public health systems also likely impact the risk of virus transmission. In this context, we performed a statistical analysis of the different imported cases of dengue and chikungunya in Southern France, where the tiger mosquito is already established. A comparison between contexts with local virus transmission and situations without local transmission made it possible to identify the factors associated with the risk of viral circulation. We found that a delay in reporting imported cases, the presence of wooded areas around the cases’ places of residence, and the accumulation of heat during the season, all increased the risk of transmission. The identification of these conditions is therefore of primary importance both to determine the risk of the emergence of these viruses, and to improve public health policies.
