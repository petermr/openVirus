 <p>Little is known about the contribution of virus-specific and cross-reacting antibodies (Abs) or the cellular immune response generated by a primary dengue (DENV) infection on the course of a secondary zika (ZIKV) infection 
  <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we show that the length of time between DENV/ZIKV infections has a qualitative impact on controlling early ZIKV replication. Depletion of DENV2-specific Abs in sera confirmed that those type-specific Abs do not contribute to ZIKV control. We show that the magnitude and durability of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) induced by a secondary ZIKV infection is modest compared to the response induced after a secondary heterologous DENV infection. Our 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> results are showing a complex interplay between the cellular and innate immune responses characterized by a high frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) correlating with an increase in the frequency of DENV antigen specific T cells and a significant control of ZIKV replication which is time dependent. Taken together, our results suggest that early after ZIKV infection other mechanisms such as the innate and cellular immune responses may play a predominant role in controlling ZIKV replication. Regardless of the time elapsed between infections there was no evidence of 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV by DENV immunity. These findings have pivotal implications while interpreting ZIKV pathogenesis in flavivirus-experimented populations, diagnostic results interpretation and vaccine designs and schedules among others.
