Because of the diversity of influenza virus strains and drug resistance to the current direct antiviral agents, there have been no effective drugs as yet to cure all patients infected by influenza viruses. Natural products from plants contain compounds with diverse structures that have the potential to interact with multiple host and virus factors. In this study, we identified the ethanol extract of <italic>Caesalpinia decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston (EEC) as an inhibitor against the replication of a panel of influenza A and B viruses both on human pulmonary epithelial A549 and human monocytic U937 cells. The animal study revealed that EEC administration reduces the weight loss and improves the survival rate of mice infected with lethal influenza virus. Also, EEC treatment attenuated lung injury and reduced virus titer significantly. In conclusion, we showed that EEC has antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the plant <italic>C. decapetala</italic> has the potential to be further developed as a resource of new anti-influenza drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd><italic>caesalpinia decapetala</italic></kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>extract</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-12-00557"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Despite the availability of vaccines and direct-acting antiviral drugs, influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality every year [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vaccination is limited to the known epidemic strains and takes a long time for preparation [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are many problems with the present anti-influenza drugs [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Amantadine and amantadine, inhibitors of the M2 ion channel, have been used for decades [<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. With strong side effects and emergence of widespread drug-resistant strains, they are no longer recommended to treat influenza [<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Current therapy for influenza includes virus neuraminidase inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors [<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors: oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir, should be administered within 48 h of the onset of symptoms [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For advanced and severely ill patients, there is no significant improvement in clinical effect [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The most recently approved drug baloxavir targets virus polymerase [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, according to the clinical results, compared with treatment in adults, baloxavir showed only a weak therapeutic effect in the susceptible population that includes children, adolescents, and the elderly, which cannot shorten the course of the disease [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since influenza causes a huge burden on society every year in most countries in the treatment of seasonal and pandemic flu, there is an urgent need to develop new anti-influenza drugs against a broad spectrum of influenza viruses, including the resistant strains [<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Plants produce a rich and diverse array of natural products; they have had a long history of medicinal use [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among them, artemisinin, one of the most famous drugs, was extracted from <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> and has been used to treat malaria [<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To explore the potential of plant extracts in the treatment of influenza, we collected 600 species of plants from Shen Long Jia, Hubei province, China. By screening the extract library comprising the ethanol extracts of the 600 plants in a U937 cell model against influenza virus infection [<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we found that the ethanol extract of <italic>Caesalpinia decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston (EEC) has antiviral activity against influenza virus infection. <italic>Caesalpinia decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston (<italic>C. decapetala</italic>) is a climbing shrub, belonging to the <italic>Caesalpinia</italic> genus of the Fabaceae family, which is distributed all over the world [<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Chemical investigations revealed that EEC contains a variety of components, such as cassane diterpenoid, spathulenol, lupeol, resveratrol, quercetin, stigmasterol, astragalin, and sitosterol [<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The extract of <italic>C. decapetala</italic> has been reported to have analgesic, anti-oxidant, anti-tumor, and anti-fertility activities [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The roots of <italic>C. decapetala</italic> are used as a folk medicine to prevent colds, treat bronchitis, and malaria [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the extract of <italic>C. decapetala</italic> has never been demonstrated experimentally to have antiviral activity. </p><p>In this study, we studied the anti-influenza activity of EEC, both in vitro and in vivo. EEC showed a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect on the replication of all strains of influenza viruses tested on Madin&#x02013;Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK), A549, and U937 cells. The animal experiments showed that EEC could improve the survival rate of mice infected with lethal influenza virus and decrease the virus titers and pathological damage to the lungs. Our results suggested that EEC has the potential to be a plant-derived drug with further research and development.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00557"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-viruses-12-00557"><title>3.1. EEC Inhibits Influenza Virus Replication on A549 Cells</title><p>To screen for natural products of plants with anti-influenza activity, we made ethanol extracts of about 600 plant species from Shen Nong Jia, Hubei province, China. By screening these plant extracts, we found that the ethanol extract of <italic>C. decapetala</italic> (EEC) inhibits the replication of the influenza virus on A549 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, EEC inhibited the H1N1 influenza virus PR8 strain infection on A549 cells, with a CC<sub>50</sub> and an EC<sub>50</sub> of 326.4 &#x003bc;g/mL and 9.8 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively. The inhibition of virion production was also tested, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f001">Figure 1</xref>B; the results showed that EEC inhibited the production of infectious virions potently and concentration-dependently. At concentrations higher than 43 &#x003bc;g/mL, the production of infectious influenza virions was below the detection limit (10 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL). The EC<sub>50</sub> of EEC is about 14 &#x003bc;g/mL. To exclude the possible cytotoxic effect of EEC on virus replication, we used the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) method to measure the cell viability by DAPI staining and to confirm the inhibitory effect by detection of the expression of M2 protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, EEC at 43.2 &#x003bc;g/mL and 14.4 &#x003bc; g/mL inhibited the virus replication completely and about 50%, respectively, which is consistent with that measured by virus production. Importantly, the DAPI staining showed that EEC at these concentrations is not cytotoxic to A549 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that EEC inhibits influenza virus replication on A549 cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-12-00557"><title>3.2. EEC Has a Broad Spectrum of Antiviral Activity against a Panel of Influenza Viruses in A549, U937, and MDCK Cells</title><p>Human influenza A and B viruses cause annual influenza epidemics, whereas influenza A viruses can also cause sporadic infections or spread worldwide in a pandemic when novel strains emerge in the human population from an animal host [<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To test the antiviral spectrum of EEC against different types and subtypes of influenza viruses, we infected A549 cells with 0.25 MOI of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H274Y), A/human/Hubei/1/2009 (H1N1), A/human/Hubei/3/2005 (H3N2), A/duck/Hubei/216/1983 (H7N8) and B/human/Hubei/1/2007, respectively. The infected cells by each virus were treated with serially diluted EEC. We found that EEC could inhibit all the influenza viruses, including the oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 (H274Y) virus, on A549 cells at a similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f002">Figure 2</xref>). During infection of humans, the influenza virus can infect multiple cell types, including epithelial cells and monocytes that are important for the pathogenesis of influenza [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We next checked the antiviral effect of EEC on epithelial MDCK cells and monocytic U937 cells against both influenza virus A and B viruses. Surprisingly, EEC was found to inhibit all the influenza virus strains both in MDCK cells and U937 cells. Comparing with canine MDCK cells, EEC inhibits more efficiently the replication of influenza viruses in human A549 and U937 cells (<xref rid="viruses-12-00557-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-12-00557"><title>3.3. Determination of the Stage Affected by EEC in the Influenza Virus Life Cycle </title><p>To determine the stage of the influenza virus life cycle inhibited by EEC, a time-of-addition assay was conducted. MDCK cells were infected with 0.1 MOI of influenza virus at 4 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, followed by cell culture at 37 &#x000b0;C for 12 h. During the cell culture, three EC<sub>50</sub> of ribavirin, oseltamivir, and EEC were added respectively at different time points and maintained for 12 h. The supernatants were collected, and the virus yields were determined by the NA activity assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, similar to oseltamivir, EEC inhibited the virus replication completely when added at all time points until 8 hpi, indicating that EEC may inhibit the very late stage of the influenza virus life cycle, which includes mainly the release of virions that is related to the function of virus neuraminidase. To determine whether EEC inhibits the virus neuraminidase activity, an in vitro neuraminidase inhibition assay was conducted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, similar to oseltamivir, EEC inhibited the neuraminidase activity concentration-dependently. Taken together, our results show that EEC inhibits the late stage of the influenza virus life cycle. Since the virus neuraminidase activity is required for the release of virions, we speculate that EEC may inhibit the release of influenza viruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-12-00557"><title>3.4. EEC Protects Mice from Lethal Influenza Virus Infection</title><p>To further study the therapeutic effect of EEC in vivo, BALB/c mice weighing about 18 g were infected with four LD<sub>50</sub> of H1N1 PR8 virus by the method of intranasal. After 3 h of infection, each group of mice (<italic>n</italic> = 10) was treated with 60, 30, and 15 mg/kg/d of EEC or placebo solution. The mice of the placebo group began to die on day 7, and all died on day 10 after infection. Compared with the placebo group, the mice treated with 60 mg/kg/d of EEC lost weight relatively slow and began to gain weight significantly after day 10, with a survival rate of 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). While the mice treated with 30 and 10 mg/kg/d of EEC had 30% and 10% of survival rate, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,C,D). Whereas treatment with the reference drug oseltamivir at 20 mg/kg/d protected 80% of mice from death caused by the same lethal dose of PR8 virus infection. These observations suggest that EEC protects mice from lethal influenza virus infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-12-00557"><title>3.5. EEC Reduces Virus Titer and Pathogenic Damage in the Lung Mediated by Influenza Virus Infection</title><p>Even though the selective indexes of EEC in the inhibitory effects against influenza virus A and B strains in human A549 and U937 cells range from 5 to 52 (<xref rid="viruses-12-00557-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), EEC does protect mice from lethal influenza virus infection. To confirm whether EEC inhibits virus replication in vivo, we next checked the virus titers in the BALFs of the infected mice treated with EEC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f004">Figure 4</xref>E, at day 3 and 7 post-infection, the virus titers in the BALFs of mice treated with 60 mg/kg/d of EEC decreased significantly (about 10 times) compared with that of the placebo group. </p><p>When mice are infected with the influenza virus, a large number of inflammatory cells are often infiltrated in the lung tissue, accompanied by enhanced inflammatory injuries in the lung [<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To examine the total cell infiltration and pathological changes in the lungs of mice infected by lethal influenza and treated or untreated with EEC, the total cell counting in the BALFs and H&#x00026;E staining of the lung tissue of mice were conducted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f004">Figure 4</xref>F, the total number of cells at day 3 and 7 in BALFs of mice treated with 60 mg/kg/d of EEC decreased by 40% and 25%, respectively. A further pathological examination by H&#x00026;E staining revealed that the pathogenic damage in the lungs treated with EEC improved significantly at day 3 and 7 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00557-f004">Figure 4</xref>G). We speculate that the reduction in infiltrated cells and pathological damage in the lung may be a result of the decrease in virus titer mediated by the antiviral effect of EEC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-viruses-12-00557"><title>4. Discussion/Conclusions</title><p>Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses that circulate the world [<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses [<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Influenza viruses circulating in animals, e.g., birds, pose threats to human health in that they can develop the ability to infect humans and cause illness [<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In patients with influenza pneumonia, multiple cell types, including epithelial cells, alveolar cells, and monocytes, are infected by the influenza virus and contribute to direct cytopathogenic and inflammatory damage to the lung [<xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our in vitro study, in addition to the commonly used MDCK cells, we tested the antiviral effect of EEC against a panel of influenza viruses on the epithelial A549 cells and monocytic U937 cells. However, the efficacy of EEC is not as good as oseltamivir (data not shown), but comparable to that of ribavirin (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00557">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to human influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2, human influenza B virus strains, the 2009 (H1N1) pandemic strain, oseltamivir-resistant strain H1N1 (H274Y), and a bird flu H7N8 were also tested. We did not measure the infectivity using TCID<sub>50</sub> assay. Instead, we tested the NA activity on the supernatants of the cell culture since we found that the TCID<sub>50</sub>s are correlated pretty well with the NA activities from the same virus-containing supernatants using a fluorescent substrate (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00557">Figure S2</xref>). Our results showed that EEC has a broad-spectrum of anti-influenza activity in multiple cell types, suggesting EEC has the potential to treat influenza.</p><p>Next, the therapeutic effect of EEC was tested on a mouse influenza model. Our results demonstrated that EEC protected mice from lethal influenza infection by increasing the survival rate that is associated with decreased virus titer, cell infiltration, and inflammatory damage to the lung. We assume that the antiviral activity of EEC contributes mainly to the therapeutic effect. Furthermore, a preliminary mechanism study revealed that EEC inhibits the neuraminidase activity and interferes with the late stage of the virus life cycle. It is worth noting that when extracted with pure H<sub>2</sub>O or ethanol, the extract of <italic>C. decapetala</italic> exhibits different antiviral activity and cytotoxicity from that extracted with 75% aqueous ethanol (data not shown). This observation suggests that the extraction methods can influence the efficacy of EEC on its antiviral activity and cytotoxicity. Further optimization of the extraction method for anti-influenza drug development is needed.</p><p>Herb medicine has a long history of being used to treat the flu. Many studies have identified bioactive components or compounds in plant extracts that may be useful for treating influenza. A variety of polyphenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, essential oils, and aromatic compounds isolated from medicinal plants and plant extracts have been extensively studied and tested for anti-influenza activity [<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, most of the efficacy studies were conducted in vitro; only a few extracts or compounds were demonstrated to be effective in vivo. Among the in vivo studies, Bing et al. reported that the total alkaloid extract from <italic>Commelina communis</italic> showed antiviral activity against influenza virus H1N1 in vivo [<xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Utsunomiya et al. found that glycyrrhizin, an active component of licorice roots, could protect mice exposed to a lethal H2N2 virus through the stimulation of IFN-gamma production by T cells. Glycyrrhizin, by itself, does not inhibit influenza virus replication [<xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00557" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Compared with these reported herb medicines, EEC showed similar efficacy to the total alkaloid extract from <italic>Commelina communis</italic>. However, it is less potent than glycyrrhizin in increasing survival rate, though they both can lower the virus titer in the lung of mice for about one log value. When compared to the clinical drug oseltamivir, EEC showed less potency both in increasing survival rate and in lowering virus titer.</p><p>EEC, at its current formula, may be not ideal as an anti-influenza drug. However, the plant <italic>C. decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston can serve as a resource of natural products to be developed as a plant-derived drug against influenza. Further research is in progress to isolate and elucidate the bioactive components or compounds responsible for the antiviral activity of this plant and to determine their mechanisms of action. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the antiviral activity of <italic>C. decapetala</italic> (Roth) Alston. Our findings suggest that the ethnobotanical use of plant drugs may provide benefits in the treatment of influenza, warranting further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Ding Gao and Juan Min (Center for instrumental analysis and metrology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS) and Xuefang An (Center for animal experiments) for technical support.</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-viruses-12-00557"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>Supplementary materials can be found at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/5/557/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/5/557/s1</uri>.
