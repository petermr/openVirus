 <p id="Par1">Computational Science attempts to solve scientific problems through the design and application of mathematical models. Researchers and research teams need domain knowledge, along with skills in computing and, increasingly, data science expertise. We have been working to draw students into STEM, Computational Science and Data Science through our Team Zombie outreach program. The program leads the students through a scenario of a disease outbreak in their local area, which turns out to a potential zombie apocalypse. They become part of Team Zombie, a multi-disciplinary response team that investigates the outbreak; models the spread and potential interventions; works towards cures or vaccines; and provides options for detection and monitoring. Throughout the activities we make reference to real-world situations where the techniques are applied. Our program has engaged students from primary school through to university level, raising awareness of the range of approaches to problem solving through models and simulations. We hope this will inspire students to choose courses and careers in computational and data science.</p>
