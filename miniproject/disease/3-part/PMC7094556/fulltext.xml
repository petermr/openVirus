Significant scientific work has resulted in multiple candidate vaccines that are now undergoing further clinical development, with several vaccines now in phase 2 clinical trials. In this review, we survey current vaccine efforts, preclinical and clinical results, and ethical and other concerns that directly bear on vaccine development.

Notably, the nonstructural NS5 protein is implicated in RNA synthesis and viral replication.

Zika virus E protein is the main surface protein that participates in host cell receptor attachment and virus lipid bilayer fusion, while the nonstructural NS1 through NS5 proteins are engaged in virus propagation. Robust adaptive immune responses to ZIKV E, NS1, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 proteins such as production of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses have been detected in animal models of ZIKV infection, which indicates that vaccination may protect against ZIKV disease.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>

This may be particularly true in pregnant women and women of childbearing age, infants/children, older adults, and those who are immunocompromised. Given the destructive fetal effects of Zika infection and the need to protect unborn children, it seems reasonable that the group requiring the most immediate protection is women, followed by men, of childbearing potential. This will likely be followed by the desire and need to protect all ages. Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome may be particularly more likely and severe among older adults, and hence this represents a different spectrum of risk group. Such considerations may drive vaccine development efforts.

With the obvious caveat that these are models that only partially recapitulate human anatomy, physiology, and immune response, animal models of infection provide important insights because capturing the complexity and systemic interactions required for immune function requires a living organism. These models provide complete control over baseline characteristics (eg, age, sex, pregnancy status, preexisting immunity), timing and dose of infection, sampling time points, biospecimen collection (eg, blood, tissues, organs), and the ability to examine gonadal tissues and products of conception.</p><p id="p0100">Mouse models are inexpensive, are available on multiple genetic backgrounds, are conducive to large sample sizes, and have a vast array of relevant immunologic tools (ie, antibodies and sequence information) available. Mouse models of ZIKV infection are relatively common, and a number of strains have been used to examine aspects of ZIKV disease.<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> Zika virus has variable replication efficiency in wild-type mouse strains (BALB/c greater than C57BL/6) but does not produce clinical illness in adult mice. Disruption of IFN responses is required for disease manifestations. The most common models are inbred strains on the 129 background that lack the IFNAR1 (A129) or both the IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 (AG129) and a strain on the B6 background lacking IFNAR1. Severe combined immunodeficiency mice also develop disease but at a delayed rate compared with AG129. Mice lacking INF response factors (IRFs) (eg,&#x000a0;IRF3, IRF5, IRF7) also exhibit disease symptoms on experimental infection. Unfortunately, the immunosuppressed nature of these animals complicates vaccine development and testing. The use of INF receptor&#x02013;blocking antibodies can be utilized in wild-type mice to recapitulate disease susceptibility. The use of neonatal mice and/or intracranial inoculation can produce some disease symptoms (eg, neurologic signs or paralysis). A model of intrauterine infection has been established in Swiss Jim Lambert (SJL) mice.<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref>

Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are most commonly used. Clinical symptoms include erythema, fever, and lymphadenopathy, and virus can be found in multiple body fluids.<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> New World monkeys have more severe clinical symptoms after flavivirus infection than Old World monkeys and may represent a more restrictive animal model.<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> It should be noted that different ZIKV strains induce different symptoms in different animals, suggesting that human disease manifestations may also be strain-dependent. The nonhuman primate studies have provided important insights into ZIKV immunity, as well as efficacy testing for developmental vaccines. Together with the mouse strains, these animal models will continue to be useful platforms for testing and evaluating ZIKV vaccines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Current Status of Vaccine Development</title><p id="p0110">The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in the Pacific and South America significantly heightened public health awareness of Zika as well as increased research interest in Zika virology, pathology, epidemiology, and immunology.

Neutralizing antibody titers were low but detectable after a single immunization and were significantly increased following the booster immunization. Mice were pretreated with IFNAR-blocking antibody and then challenged with ZIKV (Dakar 41519).

In contrast, mice given a prime-boost immunization exhibited no viremia, no weight loss, and 100% survival.

</p><p id="p0155">A wide variety of other preclinical-stage vaccine candidates are currently being developed. The Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group is using an established mass spectrometry approach to isolate ZIKV-derived peptides from infected cells for use as a peptide-based vaccine. Peptide-based vaccines have a number of significant advantages that would be ideally suited for use as a ZIKV vaccine: inexpensive to manufacture, safe for universal administration, no cold chain requirements, easily stored and administered, can contain T- and/or B-cell epitopes, and have a defined epitope selection in order to avoid ADE. Preclinical studies utilizing such peptides in combination with biodegradable nanoparticles in mice are currently in progress.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Expert Commentary and a Look Ahead</title><p id="p0160">We believe that safe and effective Zika vaccines can be developed and approved; however, major concerns exist. First, because Zika outbreaks have essentially ceased and are unpredictable, it is likely that vaccine development may be stalled and timely efforts curtailed. Recently, the results of a WHO/National Institutes of Health conference on this issue have been published.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> This problem may require the use of the Food and Drug Administration animal rule, human challenge studies, passive transfer animal studies, and other methods in order to continue to advance vaccine development and licensure.</p><p id="p0165">Historically, such has been the case when an emerging pathogen causes substantial concern and threatens public health, emergency funding from governments results, only to not be sustained as the epidemic wanes. The recent lessons of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Lassa fever, and to a lesser extent Ebola and others, loom large in this regard. When financial costs and profit are uncertain, the private sector will be reluctant to invest the magnitude of dollars necessary to bring such a vaccine to the point of licensure. If so, sustainable models for funding must be developed before the next large outbreaks of Zika.</p><p id="p0170">Second, given current realities, it is likely that more than one Zika vaccine type may need to be developed. For example, an inactivated vaccine will be required for pregnant women and perhaps women of childbearing age. Live attenuated vaccines could be deployed in children, males, and older adults. Higher-potency or adjuvanted vaccines may be needed for the immunosenescent elderly and those who are immunocompromised. DNA- or vector-based vaccines may prove more immunogenic and result in longer-lasting immunity.</p><p id="p0175">Third, more research is necessary to determine what the Zika infection outcomes of interest are that we want vaccine to prevent. Is it GBS? Zika congenital conditions? Latent infection and persistence in gonadal organs? Other? Fourth, issues of vaccine-induced immunity are significant. How many doses will be required and over what time periods? How durable and long-lasting will vaccine-induced immunity be? Are there risks for ADE in humans resulting in inadvertent harm? Fifth, ethical issues such as human challenge studies that include pregnant women in vaccine development clinical trials and include children in clinical trials, among others, must be defined. These and other important questions remain and must be solved. Although we believe they are solvable, it may require considerable time&#x02014;even decades&#x02014;to do so. In the meantime, the most advanced candidate vaccine in clinical development appears to be the National Institutes of Health-developed vaccine. It is likely, assuming no safety concerns arise in future phase 3 studies, that this vaccine will be the first licensed. This is likely to be followed by additional vaccines and effective antiviral drugs to treat and prevent infection over the short term.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0180">Public health urgency, advances in genetics-based design of vaccines, and newer insights in immunology have combined to accelerate vaccine development against Zika virus. Multiple vaccine candidates are already in preclinical through phase 2 studies, with some poised to enter phase 3 studies of efficacy. This is remarkable given the fact that Zika virus went relatively unnoticed until the large outbreaks in Brazil starting in 2016. On the positive side, this extraordinary progress has resulted from collaborations among academia, biotech start-ups, pharmaceutical companies, nongovernmental organizations, and a variety of funders. On the negative side, inadequate research funding, late funding given the initial outbreaks in the Yap Islands in 2007, and a variety of difficulties in moving vaccine candidates down the development pipeline, have slowed progress. In particular, governments must invest the research and development dollars and provide industry incentives for rapid clinical development to occur. This must be a shared burden but should particularly have intense and sustained involvement by the countries where mosquito abatement has been &#x0201c;too little too late&#x0201d; and where outbreaks of this disease have developed. Additionally, these outbreaks are an excellent example of the need for a global funding entity&#x02014;as called for in a recent publication. It is likely that in the private sector, the costs of Zika vaccine development cannot be recouped due to the relative lack of current and ongoing large-scale outbreaks. Thus, industry will need incentives or government-provided development dollars to invest resources into the multimillion dollar enterprise needed to advance a vaccine candidate through to approval by regulatory authorities.</p><p id="p0185">In the meantime, limited history thus far suggests that ZIKV outbreaks can strike and abate relatively rapidly, with limited ability to predict where the next outbreak(s) will occur. Other unknowns include possible further mutational divergence of strains and the development of new Zika clades that may require more than a monotypic vaccine for full protection. Lastly, thoughtful decisions must be made regarding whom and with what priority different groups should receive vaccine, at what ages, and to prevent which outcomes. Other issues such as whether pregnant women can be enrolled in vaccine studies and receive specific vaccine types will need to be debated and considered.</p><p id="p0190">The health and well-being of the globe requires a safe and effective Zika vaccine. For couples of childbearing age desiring to have children, the prospect of Zika infection is terrifying. Maternal infections can and do lead to a spectrum of congenital consequences&#x02014;some of which are severe and much of which is yet to be fully unraveled. The global community must pay attention and remain undeterred by the tyranny of the next urgency that detracts attention away from the goal of a vaccine. It is not simply an infection &#x0201c;over there&#x0201d;&#x02014;this is a global issue that requires a global solution. The future and health of the most vulnerable among us&#x02014;the yet unborn&#x02014;depends on our efforts.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Barcellos</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Brasil</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Zika virus epidemic in Brazil: from discovery to future implications</article-title><source>Int J Environ Res Public Health</source><volume>15</volume><issue>1</issue><year>2018</year><fpage>96</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Plotkin</surname><given-names>S.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mahmoud</surname><given-names>A.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrar</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Establishing a global vaccine-development fund</article-title><source>N&#x000a0;Engl J Med</source><volume>373</volume><issue>4</issue><year>2015</year><fpage>297</fpage><lpage>300</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26200974</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</collab></person-group><article-title>Zika virus: statistics and maps</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/reporting/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fzika%2Freporting%2Fcase-counts.html" id="intref0060">https://www.cdc.gov/zika/reporting/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fzika%2Freporting%2Fcase-counts.html</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leder</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Grobusch</surname><given-names>M.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gautret</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>GeoSentinel Surveillance Network.
