</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">The term viral hepatitis refers to liver inflammation that occurs because of a viral infection. There are 5 hepatotropic viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E) that selectively infect the liver. Acute hepatitis caused by these viruses may resolve without intervention or may develop into chronic infection in some instances. Nonhepatotropic viruses target different organs in the body but are also known to cause hepatitis, although these infections are typically mild in immunocompetent hosts. The significance of nonhepatotropic viruses is most notable in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in transplant recipients.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Hepatitis D</title><p id="p0040">Hepatitis D virus (HDV), also called delta virus, was first described in 1977 in a group of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) who were found to have more severe hepatitis than their counterparts.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The hepatitis D virion consists of the hepatitis D RNA genome, hepatitis D antigen (HDAg), and a lipoprotein envelope containing HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) proteins.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Thus, HDV requires HBV in addition to cellular RNA polymerases for replication and cannot infect individuals without the presence of HBsAg, which is required for cell entry, virion assembly and export. Since the widespread availability of the hepatitis B vaccine with worldwide implementation of vaccination programs, a concomitant decrease in HDV alongside HBV would be expected. However, the prevalence of HDV seems to be increasing and may be attributed to the higher prevalence of HDV infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected individuals and intravenous drug users.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>

The diagnostic window is narrow because patients typically present after the peak viremic period has concluded. Anti-HEV IgM is produced early after infection, coinciding with peak alanine transaminase levels, and may last 4 to 6&#x000a0;months. Anti-HEV IgG is first present at low titers and increases incrementally over time. Thus, patients who present early may only have detectable HEV RNA, whereas many patients do not present until the early viremic period has already subsided.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> In immunocompetent hosts, diagnosis of acute HEV infection may require anti-HEV IgM or HEV RNA.</p><p id="p0175">In immunocompromised hosts, levels of anti-HEV immunoglobulin are lower and frequently undetectable, so diagnosis often requires testing for HEV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for confirmation. The World Health Organization has developed an international standard for nucleic acid amplification techniques to improve HEV RNA detection and quantification.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> To increase diagnostic rates of HEV, use of at least 2 of the 3 markers mentioned earlier is suggested to increase yield, particularly because accuracy and reliability of anti-HEV immunoglobulin assays differ widely in laboratories and among the particular individuals being tested.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref>

By contrast, liver biopsy is often obtained before chronic HEV infection is suspected in immunosuppressed hosts because unexplained increase in transaminase levels is the typical presentation with no other clinical symptoms. In patients with known infection, liver biopsy may be beneficial for staging of fibrosis given the potential risk for accelerated progression to cirrhosis.

HDV remains difficult to treat with the current available therapies and typically leads to chronic disease after superinfection with an accelerated course to cirrhosis or related complications. HEV leading to chronic hepatitis is more common in immunocompromised hosts. Although the hepatotropic viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV) may cause disease in all exposed individuals, the nonhepatotropic viruses (ie, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, CMV) typically have self-limited courses that may include a mild hepatitis caused by the immune system&#x02019;s response to the virus at the time of primary infection. For immunocompromised hosts, the risk of clinical disease from the nonhepatotropic viruses is typically at the time of reactivation, with the potential for significant morbidity and
