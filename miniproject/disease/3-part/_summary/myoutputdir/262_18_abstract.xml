 <p>The travel-related infection risks in the significantly immunocompromised traveler are complex and comprise vaccine preventable, vector-borne, and other nonvaccine preventable infections. A thorough risk assessment should be performed before travel and advice sought from relevant specialists. Immunosuppression used to treat autoimmune diseases and their mechanisms of action need particular consideration.This risk assessment needs to take the patient's beliefs and preferences into account. It is also important not to neglect noninfectious travel considerations.</p>
