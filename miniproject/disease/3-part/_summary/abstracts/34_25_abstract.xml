 <p>The explosive spread of Zika virus, a flavivirus, to South- and Central America underscores the potential threat of newly emerging arthropod-borne viruses. Zika virus infection can cause congenital birth defects and neurological complications. Many people at risk are flavivirus pre-immune because of prior infections with other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue virus, which co-circulates in Zika outbreak regions) or vaccinations (e.g. against yellow fever or tick-borne encephalitis) and have non-protective cross-reactive antibodies at the time of infection. Since pre-existing immunity can modulate the specificity and functional activity of antibody responses, and cross-reactive antibodies have been implicated in disease enhancement, we compared the specificities of serum samples from flavivirus-naïve and vaccinated individuals after primary Zika virus infections. Prior immunity led to a strong booster of cross-reactive antibodies that did not neutralize Zika virus. Importantly, we could also show that newly formed IgM antibodies contributed significantly to virus neutralization and prevented infection enhancement by other antibodies. Our data thus show how pre-existing cross-reactive immunities can alter the specificities and functional activities of antibody responses in flavivirus infections, which may affect flavivirus-induced disease and the efficacy of vaccinations.</p>
