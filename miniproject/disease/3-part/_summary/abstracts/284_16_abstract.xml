 <title>Summary</title>
 <p>Hemagglutinins (HAs) from human influenza viruses adapt to bind α2-6-linked sialosides, overcoming a receptor-defined species barrier distinct from the α2-3 specificity of avian virus progenitors. Additionally, human-adapted HAs gain glycosylation sites over time, although their biological function is poorly defined. Using quantitative glycomic analysis, we show that HAs from human pandemic viruses exhibit significant proportions of high-mannose type N-linked glycans throughout the head domain. By contrast, poorly adapted avian-origin HAs contain predominately complex-type glycans, which have greater structural diversity. Although oligomannose levels vary, they are present in all tested recombinant HAs and whole viruses and can be specifically targeted for universal detection. The positions of high-mannose glycosites on the HA of human H1N1 and H3N2 strains are conserved. Additionally, high-mannose-binding lectins possess a broad capacity to neutralize and prevent infection with contemporary H3N2 strains. These findings reveal the biological significance of HA glycosylation and therapeutic potential of targeting these structures.</p>
