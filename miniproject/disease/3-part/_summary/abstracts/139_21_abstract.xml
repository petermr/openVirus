 <p>Enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71), a member of the enterovirus genus, is a virulent pathogen causing neurological complications. EV-A71 mainly spreads through oral-fecal or oral-oral transmission, as well as respiratory droplets. EV-A71 outbreaks have cyclically occurred throughout some Asian countries since 1997, with millions of people affected. The presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to EV-A71 can represent the prevalence of previous EV-A71 infections and seroprevalence studies are widely used to understand prevalence of infectious diseases. The results of our study demonstrate that about 50% of young children under 3 years of age were infected during the 2011 epidemic in southern Vietnam. The high seroprevalence of EV-A71 neutralizing antibody in children living in southern Vietnam indicates the necessity of introducing EV-A71 vaccines, particularly for children under 6 months of age. Moreover, it is critical to understand EV-A71 disease burden for formulating national vaccination policy in the future.</p>
