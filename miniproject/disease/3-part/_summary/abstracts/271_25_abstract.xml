 <p>Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika are an increasing public health concern worldwide. The mentioned VBDs are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito from the 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> species. Preventing or reducing VBDs continues to depend mainly on vector control and interrupting human-vector contact. Risk communication (RC) is the interactive exchange of information about hazards among experts and individuals. As it influences individuals’ behaviour, a better understanding of how it works is vital to improving RC strategies in the context of VBD prevention and control strategies. Our study highlighted the complexity of this matter as we found that there are multiple factors, including the volume of information, trust, experience with a similar disease and cultural schemas that determine how people cope with risk and information. We recommend broadening the use and scope of media platforms to share information and to customise the messages taking the cultural schemas of the community into account.
