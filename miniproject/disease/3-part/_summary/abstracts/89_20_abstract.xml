 <p>The numbers and types of mosquito species in a community vary across space and time, and this variability may be linked to variation in risk of human exposure to mosquito-borne diseases. In this report, the authors use a long-term mosquito-borne virus (i.e., arbovirus) surveillance dataset from the State of Connecticut (CT), United States to first examine whether or not the same land cover classes explain variation in mosquito and arbovirus community composition; they then used statistical models to determine which mosquito species were the most likely and unlikely to test positive for an infection for one of seven arboviruses circulating in CT. Multiple mosquito species tested positive for each arbovirus examined, and blood feeding behaviors were the strongest predictor of whether or not a mosquito species tested positive for a particular arbovirus. Isolations of bird-host arboviruses aggregated in discrete habitat types, while isolations of mammalian-host arboviruses showed no specific habitat associations. The authors conclude that risk of bird-host arbovirus exposures in humans is driven by only a few key mosquito species, whereas risk of mammalian-host arbovirus exposure in humans could be attributed to the general presence and abundance of mammal-feeding mosquito species in the community.</p>
