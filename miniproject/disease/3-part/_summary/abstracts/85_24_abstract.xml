 <p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a neglected mosquito-borne zoonotic disease that causes major outbreaks and economic harm to human and ruminants health leading to increased poverty within affected communities. RVF is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) affecting humans and a wide range of ruminants. The virus is transmitted through bites from mosquitoes and exposure to blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected ruminants. It was first isolated in Kenya in 1930 and several outbreaks have been recorded in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We studied pastoralist communities living along livestock migratory routes. Migratory livestock do move long distances in search of water and pasture and may be at higher risk of exposure to RVFV. We also determined risk factors for RVFV infection by studying age, gender, contact with animals through birthing, and occupation. Prevention and control of RVFV infection can target significant risk factors to prevent spread and re-occurrence of outbreaks.</p>
