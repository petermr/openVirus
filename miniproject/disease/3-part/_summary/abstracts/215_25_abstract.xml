 <p>A recent study in French Guiana suggested that populations living in precarious neighborhoods were more at risk for chikungunya CHIKV than those living in more privileged areas. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was more frequent in precarious pregnant women than in non-precarious pregnant women as reflected by their health insurance status. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted including ZIKV pregnant women with serological or molecular proof of ZIKV during their pregnancy between January and December 2016. Health insurance information was recorded at delivery, which allowed separating women into: undocumented foreigners, precarious but with residence permit, and non-precarious. Overall 6654 women were included. Among them, 1509 (22,7%) had confirmed ZIKV infection. The majority of women were precarious, but the proportion of precarious women was significantly greater in ZIKV-confirmed 728/906 (80.4%) than the ZIKV-negatives 1747/2533 (69.0%). Precariousness and undocumented status were associated with a higher prevalence of ZIKV acquisition during pregnancy. The present results illustrate that in French Guiana, as elsewhere, ZIKV transmission disproportionately affected the socially vulnerable pregnant women, presumably because of poorer housing conditions, and lack of vector control measures in poor neighborhoods.</p>
