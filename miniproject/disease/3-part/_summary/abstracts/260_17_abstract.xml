 <p>Emerging or emerged diseases and viral pathogens are responsible historically and currently for large epidemics, global pandemics, and significant morbidity and mortality. Our civilization will continue to face the emergence of new pathogens and viruses: viruses will continue to evolve and adapt to new environments at a high rate; our population continues to grow through birth rate, land development, and migration; climate change will continue to increase the vector burden and spread and change the migratory pattern of animals; and our societal mobility will continue to increase through rapid transportation. The clinical evaluation of the febrile patient with a potential emerging viral pathogen involves documenting the likelihood for an infection by a detailed travel history, calculation of an incubation time by exposure, and an understanding of the disease progression though the clinical illness, which drives the differential diagnosis and the type of diagnostics ordered. Ultimately, the proper identification and diagnosis of a patient with a viral febrile illness due to an emerging pathogen will elicit the appropriate precautions to protect health care providers and communities, deliver appropriate therapeutic interventions, and initiate a targeted public health response.</p>
