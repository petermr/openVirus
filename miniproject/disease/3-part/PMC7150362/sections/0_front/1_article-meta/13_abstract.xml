 <p>The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence.</p>
 <p>According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir.</p>
 <p>Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete.</p>
 <p>The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).</p>
