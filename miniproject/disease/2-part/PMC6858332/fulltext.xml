In this research, we study the interplay between human mobility and dengue outbreaks in the complex urban environment of the city-state of Singapore. We integrate both stylized and mobile phone data-driven mobility patterns in an agent-based transmission model in which humans and mosquitoes are represented as agents that go through the epidemic states of dengue. We monitor with numerical simulations the system-level response to the epidemic by comparing our results with the observed cases reported during the 2013 and 2014 outbreaks. Our results show that human mobility is a major factor in the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue even on the short scale corresponding to intra-city distances. We finally discuss the advantages and the limits of mobile phone data and potential alternatives for assessing valuable mobility patterns for modeling vector-borne diseases outbreaks in cities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Diseases</kwd><kwd>Nonlinear phenomena</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rapid urbanization and increased mobility brings new challenges for epidemics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Estimates show that more than half of the world&#x02019;s population already lives in cities, while further big increases are expected especially in Asia and Africa. Challenges presented by new megacities include the rapid spread of new epidemics, which can become worldwide threats due to increased global connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Poor housing conditions in rapidly growing cities can exacerbate epidemic threats, especially in the case of insect and rodent vector diseases and geohelminths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Governments need to look for innovative solutions for monitoring and controlling epidemics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. An important part of these considerations is understanding the relationship between disease spread and human mobility, which have been previously linked on global scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of pervasive technologies, specifically mobile phone data, in predicting and understating the emergence of mosquito borne disease outbreaks in urban environments. Cell phone data has been shown to be valuable in monitoring mobility patterns in near real-time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Such information has a large potential in epidemiological modeling and control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, yet it has been often unreliable and difficult to obtain with traditional methods, especially in developing countries with rapidly changing urban environments and limited resources to conduct travel surveys.</p><p id="Par3">We study the influence of human mobility on the spread of the mosquito-borne dengue virus, as inferred from a large-scale mobile communication dataset in the city-state of Singapore. Contrary to previous studies that either focused on this problem at the scale of countries or regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, essentially treating cities as well-mixed nodes in a larger travel network, or used small-scale data of human movement inside cities collected through surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> or only use theoretical models and aggregate on intra-city human mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we now employ a large-scale dataset of human mobility to study the connection between intra-city mobility and dengue spread. We focus on comparing a dengue transmission model based on people&#x02019;s real commuting patterns (as inferred from the mobile phone dataset) with the observed dengue cases and with simulations employing random mobility models. This allows us to measure the impact of mobility model on the accuracy of modeling the spatial distribution of dengue cases. We especially focus on comparing random mobility that results in perfect mixing of population with more structured mobility models, effectively evaluating the importance of intra-city human mobility in dengue spread.</p><p id="Par4">Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection, transmitted by female mosquitoes of the species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus when biting humans. The infection causes flu-like symptoms with occasional complications that can be fatal. There are four strains of the virus and the infection with one strain produces lifelong immunity to that type. However, a second infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. Dengue continues to be a global threat, with about half the world&#x02019;s population being at risk of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Worldwide, there are more than 50 million infections every year, leading to half a million hospitalizations and up to 25 thousands deaths. Dengue is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. The prevention and control solely depends on controlling the mosquito populations. There is active development for vaccines, with a first-generation vaccine becoming available recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Dengue affects Singapore in particular and two major outbreaks were observed in 2013 and 2014 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Temperature Dependency of the Dengue cases and Schematic representation of the Human-Vectors interactions in the epidemiological model. (<bold>a</bold>) Weekly observed dengue cases and average temperature in Singapore from January 2013 to December 2014. Two outbreaks took place during those two years during the summer. It is possible to observe a correlation between temperature and number of reported cases of people affected by the disease. (<bold>b</bold>) Compartmental classification for DENGUE disease. Humans can occupy one the four top compartments: susceptible, which can acquire the infection through contacts (bites) with infectious mosquitoes; exposed, where individuals are infected but are not able yet to transmit the virus; infectious, where individuals are infected and can transmit the disease to susceptible mosquitoes; and recovered or removed, where individuals are no longer infectious. The density of mosquitoes changes according to the seasonal transition from Aquatic (A) to Adult Mosquitoes (V). Similar to the humans case, Mosquitoes can occupy three different compartments and they can die with a given rate depending on the temperature.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_53127_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e316"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">The modeling of dengue outbreaks has attracted the interest of many researchers in many disciplines from physics to computational biology. Presented models investigate, for example, the variability of the mosquito population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the variability of the human population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the vertical transmission between mosquitos (that is, the transmission between mosquito generations)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> as well as seasonal patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Otero <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> presented a dengue model, which takes into account the evolution of the mosquito population. Another study shows that dengue appears to travel in waves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. As the flight range of mosquitoes is limited to a few hundred meters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, it is generally assumed that humans carry the dengue virus to previously dengue-free areas and infect local mosquitoes. There is evidence that the spread of mosquito-borne diseases is related to human mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Various agent-based simulations suggest that the mobility of humans could be the main driving force behind the spread of the dengue virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Teurlai <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> showed that the human mobility, estimated from the road network, influences the spread at a national scale in Cambodia. Especially house-to-house human movements seem to play a key role in Iquitos, Peru<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Related malaria studies show that human mobility, which is estimated from cell-phone networks, drives the dissemination of malaria parasites as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Recently Wesolowski <italic>et al</italic>. studied the impact of human mobility on the emergence of dengue epidemics in Pakistan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> using mobile phone-based mobility.</p><p id="Par6">Considering the threat presented by dengue especially in cities, many authors studied the effect of dengue fever in urban environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. While these work generally assume that intra-city mobility is an important factor for dengue epidemics, a direct quantification of this effect is still lacking. For the first time, we analyze the effectiveness of mobile phone useage data to predict the dengue spreading in an urban environment, such as Singapore. In doing so, we compare random mobility patterns with the real one estimated from anonymized mobile phone usage records in an agent-based model of dengue transmission adapted from previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This way, we are able to characterize the effect of human mobility on urban scales in the spread of vector-borne diseases and the effectiveness to use mobile phone data to estimate disease epidemics on this scale as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">We propose an agent-based dengue transmission model in which humans and mosquitoes are represented as agents and humans go through the epidemic states of dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To model dengue dynamics, we use a stochastic population model based on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework employed by Lourenco and Recker to describe a dengue outbreak in Madeira, Portugal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and then used by Wesolowski and colleagues to model the dengue outbreak in Pakistan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

We can observe that the mobile phone mobility model and the radiation model perform in a similar way, consistently well approximating the observed spatial distribution during the time period of our study. The Levy-distribution model is performing slightly worse, while the random mobility model gives significantly worse results. Looking at the results in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, we find that the overall distribution of the infected cases for the random mobility model corresponds well to the average population density (i.e. average of work and home locations in each cell). This means that our random mobility model achieves a good mixing among the population. The difference from the real distribution of dengue cases and the other mobility models highlights that uniform mixing among the population does not account for a spread of dengue in Singapore, thus mobility patterns are an important factor. While previous large-scale epidemiological studies often treat cities as well-mixed nodes in a larger travel network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, our results show that disease spreading can exhibit important localized patterns inside cities as well, in line with studies done previously on smaller samples of the population or aggregate models of human mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. It is unclear yet, how the intra-city and inter-city epidemiological models are best reconcilied; we note that frequent travelers are often a non-uniform sample of the total population of any city, thus local and long-range spread of infectious diseases can have complex intervowen patterns. The further difference between the Levy and radiation mobility model is consistent with previous work which found the radiation model to best reproduce the statistical properties of human commuting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the good results obtained from the mobile phone data show that the home-work commuting estimated from this dataset indeed accounts for the most important factors in human mobility in Singapore.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Spatial analysis.

The populations most at risk are those living in poverty in the tropical and subtropical areas, but as the case of Singapore shows, highly developed cities and countries still need continued efforts to prevent outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The rapid urbanization, the increase in international travel and trade, the modification of agriculture and environmental changes have increased the spread of vector populations, putting more and more people at risk. Mobile phone data can give real-time mobility information that can be combined with infectious disease surveillance data and seasonally varying environmental data to map these changing patterns of vulnerability in cities that are changing everyday. In this paper we proposed an agent based model in order to explicitly simulate the epidemic spread of the disease as governed by the transmission dynamics of the dengue virus through human-mosquito interactions and promoted by the population movements across the city state of Singapore. In this methodology humans and mosquitoes are represented as agents and humans go through the epidemic states of dengue.</p><p id="Par16">We modelled four different mobility patterns: 1) mobility estimated from mobile phone data, 2) random mobility patterns, 3) mobility estimated from census data following a Levy distribution model and 4) mobility estimated from census data following a radiation model. We were able to reproduce the main temporal and spatial patterns of the dengue outbreak in 2013 and 2014. Our results show that human mobility is a very important factor in the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue even on the short scale corresponding to intra-city distances. This is evidenced by the large difference found between the observed spatial pattern of dengue cases and the ones obtained by the completely random mobility model which corresponds to a &#x0201c;perfect mixing&#x0201d; among the population. This extends the results obtained from the previous work of Wesolowski <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> who showed how human mobility determines the spread of dengue on the scale of a country and studies that investigated the relationship between human mobility and spread of vector diseases on different spatial scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. We believe that our main contribution is showing that human mobility patterns are important for the spread of vector-borne diseases even on intra-city scales; this is in contrast to previous studies which often assume cities to be a well-mixed environment for the purpose of epidemiology and study disease spreading between cities and regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It is an interesting question for future work to what extent this result applies to other types of diseases, e.g. airborne infections that require only shorter co-location of people to spread, thus are able to exploit mixing of population in a more rapid way.</p><p id="Par17">Furthermore, we found that more sophisticated models of intra-city mobility can give good estimates of the spatial spread of dengue, opening up the possiblity to incorporate these into modeling and control of vector diseases in urban environments. The proposed methods could be integrated into urban planning in near real time. Mobile phone data is an obvious candidate for this purpose, giving real-time information on people&#x02019;s movements. A major limitation of mobile phone data generated by national operators is the difficulty in capturing cross-border travel patterns and it is not possible to monitor with high accuracy the flux of people travelling to the city. On the other hand, we found that the radiation model of people&#x02019;s commuting behavior performs similarly well, opening up the possibility to improve prediction of disease spread if accurate census data is available. Thus, we believe our methods can be readily used in other cities where these mobility models can be estimated, while accuracy will be affected by overall predictability of human movements and regularity of commuting patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Concluding, we note that the methods we presented here can be readily generalized to consider different mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, malaria, yellow fever and different sources and models of human mobility, having a large potential usability for better understanding, control and prevention of vector disease epidemics in urbanized areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par18">The code used for our simulations is available online<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mobile phone data</title><p id="Par19">Anonymized call detail records (CDRs) were collected over a two month period in 2011 by one of the mobile phone operators in Singapore with a significant market share (a statistical analysis is reported in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref> in the supplementary materials.). The data includes more than 2 billion records in total and includes the approximate time and location of events (including phone calls and text messages). Locations are collected at the cell tower level with further noise applied for privacy reasons. We use this data to assign two &#x0201c;favorite&#x0201d; locations to each user: (i) home and (ii) work. In Singapore, according to a study by the Land Transport Authority, about 80% of all trips go to either a work or a home location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This implies that the infection with the dengue virus in Singapore very likely happens either at home or at work, thus we focus on commuting between these two locations when modeling human mobility in this paper. To estimate home and work locations, we perform a spatial clustering of the CDRs, creating overlapping clusters of events which are spatially close to each other (a threshold of 500&#x02009;m was used so as to account for the potential uncertainty regarding which one of nearby antennas a phone connects to). To be able to distinguish between home and work locations, we performed this clustering procedure separately for records generated between 8&#x02009;pm and 6am on weekdays and during weekend (for home locations) and records generated between 10&#x02009;am and 4&#x02009;pm on weekdays (for work locations). After this procedure, we selected the largest clusters for both cases and filtered the list of users who had at least 10 events in both clusters. Following this procedure, there are 2,307,230 users to whom we can assign a home and a work location.

In the 2013 dengue outbreak in Singapore, a significant rise in the number of dengue fever cases was reported in Singapore and caused 8 victims and a total of 22318 cases. In the week of 16&#x02013;22 June 2013, there was a record of 842 dengue cases in Singapore in a single week. This figure was far beyond the highest number of cases per week in the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. The number of weekly dengue fever cases has exceeded the epidemic threshold of 237. Similarly high number of cases were reported over the course of 2014, with the maximum number of weekly reported cases having a peak of 891. In the following years, the number of dengue cases were significantly lower due to increased efforts to control the mosquito population. We show the total number of dengue cases during 2013 and 2014 in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>. For the spatial analysis of Dengue outbreaks, we use a dataset that is a collection of data from the NEA. Data was collected twice a week since May 2013 (except for a gap in October 2013) from SGCharts Charting Singapore&#x02019;s Data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The data provide information of the number of dengue cases in local spatial clusters that were established dynamically based on the location of recent cases. Spatial clusters are typically a few hundred meters in size, encompassing multiple city blocks. This allows us to have a good representation of the spatial spread of dengue, while still protecting to privacy of people affected. We display the cumulative spatial distribution of dengue cases in 5(a).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Climate data</title><p id="Par23">We collected data about climate conditions in Singapore during years 2013 and 2014, during which two outbreaks during the respective summers took place.

This form assumes that the number of mosquitos in a cell scales with the average number of people found there, i.e. the mean of the nighttime population (defined by the number of home locations in that cell) and daytime population (defined by the number of work locations). Depending on the efficiency of vector control mechanisms, the number of female Aedes mosquitoes per residence varies greatly between countries. In Puerto Rico, the number of mosquitoes per home appears to be between 5 and 10 per home<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, whereas in Singapore, this number is estimated as slightly greater than 0.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. This means that the average number of mosquitoes per human in Singapore should be in the range from 0.004 to 0.01. Note that such incorporation of aquatic mosquitoes in our models assumes that every cell contains some breeding sites, which is necessary to sustain a mosquito population if we do not allow mosquitoes to travel between cells.</p><p id="Par29">All the aquatic mosquitoes (<inline-formula id="IEq116"><alternatives><tex-math id="M261">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Most importantly, parameter values for mosquito population modeling come from controlled experiments performed in laboratory studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Clearly, it seems prohibitably challenging to directly estimate these parameters in the wild, as tracking individual mosquitoes is infeasible; studies can test the applicability of the models by comparing predictions to estimates of observed mosquito population sizes. Furthermore, accurately measuring mosquito populations itself present difficulties in real-world conditions. We note that uncertainties in parameters are inherently linked in our model; e.g. a shorter mosquito lifespan could be offset by higher bite rate as evident from Eq.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ24" ref-type="">24</xref>. This way, any calibration process among the parameter values will likely be degenerate. Another main limitation in our dataset is that we have no estimate of any existing immunity to dengue in the population. While dengue has mulitple strains, and partial or full immunity can be acquired after being infected with a specific strain, the picture is quite complex. Similarly to uncertainty of parameters for mosquitoes, uncertainty in the size of susceptible population is linked to any variations in other parameters. For this reason, we do not perform a scaling of the population size, but use the sample obtained from the mobile phone data which covers a large part of Singapore&#x02019;s population. We deal with these issues by using established values and temperature-dependent forms from the literature for most parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, while exploring a phase space determined by variations in a small number of parameters, namely the bite rate (<inline-formula id="IEq128"><alternatives><tex-math id="M303">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
