 <p>Zika virus is an emergent pathogen that gained significant importance during the epidemic in South and Central America as unusual and alarming complications of infection were recognized. Although initially considered a self-limited benign infection, a panoply of neurologic complications were recognized including a Guillain–Barré-like syndrome and in-utero fetal infection causing microcephaly, blindness, and other congenital neurologic complications.

Here we review the current landscape and challenges confronting Zika virus vaccine development.</p>
