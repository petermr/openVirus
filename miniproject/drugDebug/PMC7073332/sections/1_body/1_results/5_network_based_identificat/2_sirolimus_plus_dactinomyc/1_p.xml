 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, our network analysis shows that sirolimus and dactinomycin synergistically target HCoV-associated host protein subnetwork by “
 <italic>Complementary Exposure</italic>” pattern, offering potential combination regimens for treatment of HCoV. Specifically, sirolimus and dactinomycin may inhibit both mTOR signaling and RNA synthesis pathway (including DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-beta (TOP2B)) in HCoV-infected cells (Fig.
