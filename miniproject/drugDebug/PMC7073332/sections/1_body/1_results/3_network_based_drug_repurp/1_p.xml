<p id="Par10">The basis for the proposed network-based drug repurposing methodologies rests on the notions that the proteins that associate with and functionally govern viral infection are localized in the corresponding subnetwork (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) within the comprehensive human interactome network. For a drug with multiple targets to be effective against an HCoV, its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of the corresponding subnetwork in the human protein–protein interactome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), as we demonstrated in multiple diseases

 </sup> using this network-based strategy. We used a state-of-the-art network proximity measure to quantify the relationship between HCoV-specific subnetwork (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) and drug targets in the human interactome. We constructed a drug–target network by assembling target information for more than 2000 FDA-approved or experimental drugs (see Materials and methods). To improve the quality and completeness of the human protein interactome network, we integrated PPIs with five types of experimental data: (1) binary PPIs from 3D protein structures; (2) binary PPIs from unbiased high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid assays; (3) experimentally identified kinase-substrate interactions; (4) signaling networks derived from experimental data; and (5) literature-derived PPIs with various experimental evidence (see Materials and methods). We used a
