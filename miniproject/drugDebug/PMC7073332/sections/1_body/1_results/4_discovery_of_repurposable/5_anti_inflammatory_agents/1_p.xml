 </sup>. As a biogenic amine, melatonin (
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (
 <italic>Z</italic> = –1.72 and GSEA score = 2) plays a key role in various biological processes, and offers a potential strategy in the management of viral infections

 </sup>. Viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on the function of multiple organs

 </sup>. The antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients’ clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription

 </sup>. In addition, the application of melatonin may prolong patients’ survival time, which may provide a chance for patients’ immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>, melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (
 <italic>Z</italic> = –1.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin. By inhibiting mast-cell-derived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis, eplerenone can improve survival of mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus
