 <italic>Z</italic> = –2.44 and GSEA score = 1), an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant property, has been used to treat cancer since the 1950s and expanded its application to several auto-immune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Crohn’s disease

 </sup>. Mercaptopurine has been reported as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by targeting papain-like protease which plays key roles in viral maturation and antagonism to interferon stimulation
