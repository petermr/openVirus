 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup> (i) 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 are β genera, and (ii) HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are α genera. We performed the phylogenetic analyses using the whole-genome sequence data from 15 HCoVs to inspect the evolutionary relationship of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 with other HCoVs. We found that the whole genomes of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 had ~99.99% nucleotide sequence identity across three diagnosed patients (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity (79.7%) with SARS-CoV among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs, revealing conserved evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).
