<p id="Par8">Protein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 was most evolutionarily conserved with SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, with sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). However, the spike protein exhibited the lowest sequence conservation (sequence identity of 77%) between 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 only has 31.9% sequence identity compared to MERS-CoV.
