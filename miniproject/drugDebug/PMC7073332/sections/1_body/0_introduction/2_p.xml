However, traditional structure-based methods are limited when three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which, unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition, targeting single virus proteins often has high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes
