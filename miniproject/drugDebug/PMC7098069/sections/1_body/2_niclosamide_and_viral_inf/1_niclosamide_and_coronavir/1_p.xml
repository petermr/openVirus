<p>Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped and nonsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses with very large genome size ranging from approximately 27 to 34 kb. Infections with human strains HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild, self-limiting respiratory infections such as the common cold.

 </sup> Nevertheless, in the past 17 years, three beta coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and this year’s SARS-CoV-2) have caused severe human disease pandemics associated with high morbidity and mortality. The outbreak of SARS in southern China between November 2002 and July 2003 eventually resulted in 8098 confirmed cases and 774 deaths reported in 17 countries with a mortality rate of 9%, while MERS, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, has caused a total of 2519 laboratory-confirmed cases including 866 associated deaths with a fatality rate of nearly 34% at the end of January 2020.

 </sup> The lack of effective treatment for coronavirus infections poses a great challenge to clinical management and highlights the urgent need for new drug discovery. Wu et al. found that niclosamide was able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication and totally abolished viral antigen synthesis at a concentration of 1.56 μM after screening a small marketed drug library.

 </sup> Niclosamide suppressed the cytopathic effect (CPE) of SARS-CoV at a concentration of as low as 1 μM and inhibited SARS-CoV replication with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of less than 0.1 μM in Vero E6 cells.

 </sup> SARS-CoV 3CL protease plays an important role in replicase polyprotein processing and serves as a key target for anti-SARS drug discovery.

 </sup> A series of 2-chloro-4-nitroanilide derivatives was discovered as potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Interestingly, niclosamide showed no obvious inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CL protease up to 50 μM, and mechanistically, it may exert its anti-SARS activity via other modes of action.
