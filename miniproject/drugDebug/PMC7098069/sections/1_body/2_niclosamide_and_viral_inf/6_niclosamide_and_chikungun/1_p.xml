<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>. CHIKV causes fever and joint pain, is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, and is cataloged as a risk group-3 pathogen. Currently, there is no effective antiviral therapy approved for Chikungunya. Niclosamide was discovered as a potent anti-CHIKV inhibitor with a low micromolar EC
 <sub>50</sub> value; it not only affects CHIKV entry via blocking low-pH-dependent virus fusion but also inhibits the cell-to-cell transmission of CHIKV infection.
