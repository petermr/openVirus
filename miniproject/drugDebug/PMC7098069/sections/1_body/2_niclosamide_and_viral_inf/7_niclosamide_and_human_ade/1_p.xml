<p>Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are nonenveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with icosahedral capsids. HAdVs comprise more than 70 different serotypes classified into seven species (HAdV A–G). HAdV infections can cause severe and often life-threatening diseases in immunosuppressed patients. Currently, no specific antiviral therapy is available to treat these infections. Three salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs including niclosamide were screened out as potent anti-HAdV inhibitors. Niclosamide showed very promising anti-HAdV activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.6 μM in the plaque assay. Subsequent mechanistic studies indicated that niclosamide inhibits the transport of the HAdV particle from the endosome to the nuclear envelop.
