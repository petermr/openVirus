<p id="sec1">The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first detected in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, which was named SARS-CoV-2 (a.k.a. 2019-nCoV) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

 </sup> Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped and positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> within the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. Many coronaviruses infect humans and other mammalian hosts. Coronavirus can be divided into four genera (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.

 </sup> Human coronavirus infections are typically mild and rarely associated with severe diseases. However, the epidemics of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused alarming morbidity and mortality.

 </sup> While coronaviruses are often zoonotic, person-to-person transmission has been confirmed for SARS-CoV-2, similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

 </sup> As of March 5, 2020, there are more than 95 333 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and at least 3282 reported deaths, indicating that it is a severe public health threat.

 </sup> There is no clinically approved antiviral for coronavirus therapy.

 </sup> Although remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug candidate by Gilead currently advanced into human clinical trials to treat COVID-19 in both China and the U.S., was reported to improve patient outcomes in a recent study,

 </sup> it is still critical and urgent to search for other effective inhibitors for the potential treatment of COVID-19.
