<p>The effects of CHLA and CHLI on viral release were next investigated by a viral release inhibition assay. Briefly, infected cells were washed and cultured in an infection medium for another 2 h, in the absence or presence of different concentrations of test compounds. The progeny viruses were then harvested and titrated. Both CHLA and CHLI inhibited virus release in a dose-dependent manner, like the positive control oseltamivir phosphate (
