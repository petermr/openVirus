<p>To identify the target(s) and possible mechanism of action for CHLA and CHLI on IAV replication, a reporter IAV-based one-cycle infection assay was performed. Briefly, MDCK cells were infected by the reporter IAV PR8-PB2-Gluc in the absence or presence of test compounds, without the addition of TPCK–trypsin in the culture medium. Without exogenous trypsin-mediated HA cleavage, the progeny viruses are non-infectious and could not initiate a second round of infection. In this context, decreased expression of the reporter luciferase would be expected upon treatment with inhibitors targeting virus entry or RNA replication.</p>
