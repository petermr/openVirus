<p>Neuraminidase inhibition assay was performed using Neuraminidase Inhibitors Screening kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, NA and various concentrations of test samples/compounds were added to each well of 96-well plates. In order to fully interact between the compounds and NA, the 96-well plates were mixed for 1 min and incubated at 37°C for 2 min. Then fluorescent substrates were added, mixed, and incubated. After incubation for 1 h, the decrease in fluorescence was monitored to reflect NA inhibition efficacy.</p>
