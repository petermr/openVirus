<p>The library of natural product samples was screened using a phenotypic screening approach described previously (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well 24 h before infection. In the presence of natural product samples (final concentration of 25 μg/mL), MDCK cells were challenged with recombinant reporter virus PR8-PB2-Gluc at an MOI of 0.01. Infection was quantified after 36 h of incubation by measuring the luciferase activity with PierceTM Gaussia Luciferase Glow Assay kit (Thermo Fisher, Hillsboro, OR, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were normalized to signals from the negative controls (virus alone with DMSO), and an average of &gt; 90% inhibition for duplicates was applied for picking hits.
