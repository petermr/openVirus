  <p>Identification of chebulagic acid (CHLA) and chebulinic acid (CHLI) as novel antiviral actives against influenza virus infection. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Antiviral determination of 15 overlapped components of unripe and ripe pods of 
   <italic>T. chebula</italic> at 12.5 μM. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> CHLA and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> CHLI were examined against influenza virus in MDCK cells 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> for dose–response evaluation (red) and cytotoxicity assay (blue). Insets: molecular structures of 
   <bold>(B)</bold> CHLA and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> CHLI. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments.
