<p id="p0030">The virus underlying COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is a betacoronavirus that is closely related to SARS-CoV. These CoVs share ~80% RNA sequence identity [
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The similarity is even greater between the viruses when comparing the sequences specific to a key drug target, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) (&gt;90% sequence identity) [
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. By contrast, MERS-CoV shares about 50% genomic sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and with the exception of some bat strains, many animal CoVs are even less similar [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
