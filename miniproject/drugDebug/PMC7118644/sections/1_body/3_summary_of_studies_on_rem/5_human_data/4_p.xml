 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This report, authored by a team from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), described the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as information on course of disease and clinical management. Seven of the 12 patients (58%) were hospitalized, and three of these patients received remdesivir intravenously at the onset of worsening symptoms (two on the eleventh day of illness and one on the seventh day). Treatment with remdesivir was tolerated, though temporary gastrointestinal upset and elevated aminotransferase levels were observed in all three patients after administration. Treatment was discontinued after respiratory symptoms improved (total treatment durations of 4 days, 5 days, and 10 days). It should be noted that one of these three patients is the same patient described in the case report discussed above [
