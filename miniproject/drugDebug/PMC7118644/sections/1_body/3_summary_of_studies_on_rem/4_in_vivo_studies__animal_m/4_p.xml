<p id="p0075">Some veterinary studies have also examined the effects of the parent nucleoside, GS-441524, in cats with FIP, a condition associated with very high mortality in cats [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Gilead Sciences (Foster City, California) had provided this drug to researchers at the University of California, Davis to evaluate its potential utility in veterinary indications [
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Subsequently, GS-441524 became an intermediate in the production of the prodrug, remdesivir, which has superior ability to transport the active compound into cells [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because both drugs yield the same active metabolite in host cells, some prior studies on the antiviral activity of remdesivir also investigate GS-441524 [
