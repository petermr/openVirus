<p id="Par19">Broad-spectrum antivirals on the other hand show significant activity against several members of the same or distinct virus families, allowing the empirical treatment of severe viral infections prior to positive diagnosis of the viral agent. Leading examples are at his point the pyrazine-carboxamide compounds T-705 (favipiravir; [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]), T-1105 and T-1106, which are broad-spectrum viral RNA polymerase inhibitors, initially developed for the treatment of influenza virus, and found effective against bunyaviruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>], paramyxoviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and flaviviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. A favipiravir resistance mechanism in influenza virus has been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Other potential broad-spectrum agents are remdesivir (GS-5734), another RNA polymerase inhibitor [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Previously thought as a one-family-broad-spectrum compound, sofosbuvir (Sovaldi™, Soforal™) has in vitro and in vivo activity against several members of the family flaviviridae, and has most recently been shown to be effective against Chikungunya virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Natural product antivirals are single molecule natural compounds or complex mixtures of organic molecules (e.g., plant extracts) with antiviral activity. Natural product antivirals frequently exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity and often a single active compound cannot be identified in extracts [
