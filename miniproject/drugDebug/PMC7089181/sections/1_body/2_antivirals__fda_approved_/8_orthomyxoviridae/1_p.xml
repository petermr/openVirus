<p id="Par16">Orthomyxoviruses, in particular influenza viruses, although not on top of the list of potential biological threat agents, are fast-moving airborne pathogens capable of causing pandemics with significant mortality. Recombinant influenza viruses could be considered as potential biological threat agents. Handling of avian influenza viruses and other influenza viruses with high pathogenic potential requires BSL-3 containment. Pandemic influenza viruses type A are transmitted by the respiratory route to birds and mammals, type B only from human to human, as well as via saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood, causing acute respiratory distress with potentially fatal outcomes in humans. In humans, infection of the respiratory tract can lead to pneumonia, secondary pneumonia and overwhelming immune responses, followed by multiorgan failure in rare cases. Orthomyxoviruses are globally endemic, and cause sporadic outbreaks, rarely pandemics. Orthomyxoviruses are enveloped viruses with a negative-sense segmented ss-RNA genome. The viral RNA polymerase has a high error rate of 1/10,000. Vaccines are composed of HA/NA subunits (purified from inactivated virions), purified subunits from recombinant sources, or live/attenuated strains of the endemic strains/subtypes of influenza A virus (currently H1N1 and H3N2), as well as those of influenza B viruses [

 <italic>Anti-orthomyxovirus drugs</italic>. FDA-approved neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®), laninamivir (Inavir®), and peramivir have marginal clinical benefits only when given early but may be useful in severe infections requiring hospitalization/mechanical ventilation [

In 2018 baloxavir-marboxil (Xofluza®), an inhibitor of the viral cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN; influenza virus polymerase PA subunit), was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza among patients aged 12 years or older [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Favipiravir developed and approved in Japan specifically for treatment of influenza virus infections, and its combination with neuraminidase inhibitors was shown to be effective in a mouse model [

Further interesting candidates are haloxanide/nitazoxanide, thiazolide compounds that were originally developed as antiparasitic agents, but were shown to inhibit influenza virus hemagglutinin maturation and intracellular trafficking of viral components in infected cells and that are now in clinical trials [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]; H + channel/viroporin; only type A viruses), are not recommended anymore for clinical use (WHO/US), due to rapid induction of viral resistance mutations: 100% of clinical isolates are resistant. A 2014 Cochrane review found no evidence for efficacy or safety of amantadine for the treatment of influenza A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, their structures may still be useful as scaffolds for the design of future M2 inhibiting drugs.
