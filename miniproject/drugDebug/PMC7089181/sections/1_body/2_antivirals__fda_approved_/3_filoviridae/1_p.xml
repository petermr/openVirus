<p id="Par11">Filoviruses are category A select agents, World Health Organization risk group 4 pathogens, high on the list of potential biological threat agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>] and their handling requires BSL-4 containment. In nature they infect primates, pigs and bats (free-tailed and fruit bats) and are transmitted to human hosts by exposure to infected bush meat and body fluids of human patients. Ebola and Marburg viruses (EBOV/MARV) cause severe viral hemorrhagic fevers with hematemesis, bloody diarrhea, prostration and case fatality rates of up to 90% within three days of infection. The EBOV envelope glycoprotein has been used in the VSV-EBOV vaccine, which is 70–100% effective preventing disease in exposed and vaccinated individuals and has been approved in October 2019 in the EU as the world’s first Ebola vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Filoviruses are filamentous enveloped viruses with Group V negative-sense single-stranded (ss) RNA genomes. The endosomal Nieman Pick C1 protein, also relevant in flavivirus infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>] and the TIM-1 (HAVCR1) receptor on the surface of T cells, also relevant for hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], are potential targets for antiviral drug development. 
 <italic>Anti-filovirus drugs</italic>. While treatment recommendations are emphasizing intensive medical support if suitable clinical facilities and cohort isolation are available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], defense against the use of filoviruses as biological weapons would benefit from an effective virus-targeting therapy. There are currently no licensed antiviral drug treatments for filoviruses. However, in a recent multi-outbreak, multi-country study (PALM- “Together save lives”) started in November 2018 in the DRC, two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) emerged as giving the greatest chance to survive Ebolavirus infection. Zmapp, mAb114 and REGN-EB3 were compared to the small-molecule drug remdesivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. The trial was stopped early with REGN-EB3 and mAb114 giving the greatest chance to survive Ebolavirus infection. The WHO recommends using these two Mabs for all further treatments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. Remdesivir (GS-5734;1-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue), a nucleoside-analogue prodrug and lead compound of the small-molecule antivirals class, has been shown to inhibit EBOV in cell culture and in non-human primates likely by chain termination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>], but showed lower efficacy in the clinical trial compared to monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics. A good alternative, albeit not tested in the DRC clinical trial, may be T705 (favipiravir; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]), a repurposed drug synthesized by FUJIFILM-Toyam Chemical Co., licensed for use against influenza virus in Japan, and since found to be a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA polymerases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. T705 and the related pyrazine-carboxamide compounds T-1105 and T-1106 have similar antiviral properties—see also section “
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Alphaviridae</xref>.” FDA approval for use of favipiravir to treat filovirus infections is pending. Several animal pilot studies, most recently in non-human primates (NHP), have shown the efficacy of favipiravir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). While extensively tested, ribavirin is not FDA approved for EBOV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Other promising candidates (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) are the FGI-106 entry inhibitor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], CM-10-18-type glycan processing inhibitors, active against Marburg virus and Ebola virus in mouse models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], a number of kinase inhibitors, including AR-12 (OSU-03012; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]), and K11777, a protease inhibitor developed for Chagas disease, which has additional activity against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus [
