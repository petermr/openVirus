<p id="p0050">Coronavirus Disease-2019 (CoViD-19) has emerged over the past months as a clinical syndrome caused by a novel beta-Coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV2. It was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China and the disease was officially named CoViD-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11th
 <sup>,</sup> 2020 following an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in the Hubei province. Since these earliest reports, this infection has spread in many countries worldwide with a significant rate of infection in Italy that currently accounts for more than 110,000 infected cases associated with 13,155 fatalities. The WHO declared CoViD-19 a pandemic on March 11th. The CoViD-19 pandemic has important implications for patients with rheumatic diseases, particularly those undergoing a variety of immunosuppressive therapies. As it seems obvious that immunosuppressive therapy increases their risk of severe disease if infected with CoViD-19, many patients have the tendency to stop their immunosuppressive treatments, especially in highly impacted areas such as the Italian Lombardy region. However, it is important to note that many commonly used immunosuppressive drugs such as JAK kinase inhibitors and tocilizumab have been proposed and/or used for the treatment of select patients who develop a frequently fatal clinical sequalae known as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) (also referred to as “cytokine storm”) following CoViD-19 infection. While data are changing rapidly and the disease trajectories can only be hypothesized, the issue whether to continue treating rheumatic disease patients needs to be addressed by the field of Rheumatology and other medical subspecialties, since some of these agents may be beneficial for specific phases or complications of the disease. SARS-CoV2 is a positive single strand 30,000 nucleotide RNA virus that includes 14 open reading frames that encode 27 proteins and belongs to the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family. Its phylogenetic data are consistent with the presence of a bat reservoir and subsequent spill over into the human population. Sequencing data shows that SARS-CoV2 shares a high degree of sequence homology with a betacoronavirus isolated from bats termed Bat-CoV-RaTG13, suggesting that the Chinese chrysanthemum bat is the likely origin of SARS-CoV2. Nonetheless, an unknown animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan has been hypothesized to act as the intermediate host, as the first cases had common contacts in a market where no bats were present (bats hibernate in December). In addition, SARS-CoV2 shares 79% and 50% gene homologies with the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that was responsible for an outbreak in 2002 and with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV responsible for infections in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively. Both these viruses had intermediate hosts that included the civet and camel, respectively, with humans serving as terminal hosts [
