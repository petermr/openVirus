<p id="p0065">In China, the guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 recommend to administer 5 million U of IFNα by vapor inhalation twice a day to the patients, in combination with ribavirin (

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lu, 2020</xref>). Clinical trials have been recently registered to evaluate a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and IFNα2b (ChiCTR2000029387) or a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir with ribavirin and IFNβ1b administered subcutanously (NCT04276688) for the treatment of COVID-19. The administration by vapor inhalation currently performed in China offers the advantage of targeting specifically the respiratory tract; however, to the best of our knowledge, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of this mode of administration have never been assessed. On the contrary, the intravenous and subcutaneous modes of administration are well-described, have already proven safe in several clinical trials, and have similar pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lokugamage et al., 2020</xref>), because of the protective effects of this interferon type in the respiratory tract. Subcutaneous IFNβ1a in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir is compared to lopinavir/ritonavir alone, hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir in the DisCoVeRy trial (NCT04315948), which is the first clinical trial of the WHO Solidarity consortium of clinical trials.
