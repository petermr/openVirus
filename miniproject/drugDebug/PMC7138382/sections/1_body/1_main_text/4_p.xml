<p id="p0050">MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are coronaviruses closely linked with SARS-CoV-2 and presenting similar properties, despite differences in their epidemiology, pathology and in several of their proteins (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2020</xref>). IFN-I treatment has been studied against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stockman et al., 2006</xref>), in numerous experiments, both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and in combination or not with lopinavir/ritonavir (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sheahan et al., 2020</xref>), ribavirin (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Morgenstern et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Omrani et al., 2014</xref>), remdesivir, corticosteroids (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Loutfy et al., 2003</xref>), or IFNγ (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sainz et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Scagnolari et al., 2004</xref>). IFNα and β were systematically relatively efficient 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and succeeded in certain animal models (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2015</xref>), but generally failed to significantly improve the disease in humans (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stockman et al., 2006</xref>). For example, a combination of IFNβ with lopinavir/ritonavir against MERS-CoV improved pulmonary function but did not significantly reduce virus replication or lung pathology severity (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sheahan et al., 2020</xref>), while a combination of IFNα2a with ribavirin delayed mortality without decreasing it on the long run (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Omrani et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the combination of IFNα2b with ribavirin gave excellent results in the rhesus macaque (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Falzarano et al., 2013</xref>), but was inconclusive in human (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arabi et al., 2017</xref>). The lack of significant disease improvement with IFN-I treatment in numerous studies can be explained by the mechanisms of inhibition of the IFN signaling pathway used by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, by the limited number of patients or animals used in the studies, or by the difficulty to decipher whether disease improvements were caused by IFN-I or the drugs used in combination with it. In addition, results often differ substantially between studies because of inconsistencies in the experimental settings or the clinical conditions (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stockman et al., 2006</xref>): for example, a study on SARS-CoV revealed a positive effect of IFN-I treatment (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Loutfy et al., 2003</xref>), while another study with a larger cohort did not detect any significant effect (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>). It has also been proposed that interferon was efficient in patients only if they lacked comorbidities (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Tawfiq et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Shalhoub et al., 2015</xref>). Subtype diversity could be another explanation of inconsistencies between studies. It was repeatedly shown that IFNβ is a more potent inhibitor of coronaviruses than IFNα (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Scagnolari et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Stockman et al., 2006</xref>): depending on the studies, IFNβ1b or IFNβ1a were the most potent IFN-I subtype in the inhibition of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hensley et al., 2004</xref>) and MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, IFNβ1 appears to be most relevant interferon to treat coronavirus infections. This fact can be related to the protective activity of IFNβ1 in the lung: it up-regulates cluster of differentiation 73 (CD73) in pulmonary endothelial cells, resulting in the secretion of anti-inflammatory adenosine and the maintenance of endothelial barrier function. This process explains why clinical data indicate a reduction of vascular leakage in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with IFNβ1a treatment (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bellingan et al., 2014</xref>). However, this effect is insufficient to decrease ARDS mortality (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ranieri et al., 2020</xref>). It has been suggested from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mice that the timing of IFN-I administration plays a crucial role: positive effects were observed if IFN-I was administered shortly after infection, but IFN-I failed to inhibit viral replication and had side-effects when administered later (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Channappanavar et al., 2019</xref>). Following a study showing that IFNβ1b was as efficient as lopinavir/ritonavir against MERS-CoV in marmosets (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2015</xref>), the combination of IFNβ1b (injected intravenously) and lopinavir/ritonavir is currently investigated in a clinical trial in Saudi Arabia (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arabi et al., 2018</xref>). This is to our knowledge the only clinical trial against MERS-CoV.
