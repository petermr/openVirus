<p id="p0045">Type 1 interferons (IFN–I) designate a group of cytokines comprising the ubiquitous α and β subtypes (themselves subdivided in several isoforms), as well as the ε, ω and κ subtypes (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Samuel, 2001</xref>). They are secreted by various cell types, notably plasmacytoid dendritic cells, upon recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) (

They are recognized by the IFNAR receptor present at the plasma membrane in most cell types. Interferon fixation on IFNAR induces the phosphorylation of transcriptional factors such as STAT1 and their relocalization to the nucleus, where they activate interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). Most ISGs are involved in inflammation, signaling and immunomodulation. They interfere with viral replication and spread by several mechanisms such as a slowdown of cell metabolism or secretion of cytokines which promote the activation of the adaptive immunity. ISGs include PRRs, which further sensitize the cell to pathogens, proteins which decrease membrane fluidity, preventing viral egress or membrane fusion, and antivirals that specifically inhibit one step of the viral cycle (

Because of their immunomodulatory properties, IFN-I are used in the treatment of numerous diseases: for example, subcutaneous injections of IFNβ have been used for more than 20 years for the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis. The role of IFNβ in the treatment of multiple sclerosis is still debated and likely results partly from the down-regulation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression in antigen-presenting cells, the induction of IL-10 secretion and the inhibition of T-cell migration (
