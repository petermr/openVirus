They represent a genetic footprint of ancestral germ-cell infections of exoviruses that is transmittable to the progeny by Mendelian segregation. Traces of human endogenous retroviruses are physiologically expressed in ovarial, testicular and placental tissues as well as in stem cells. In addition, a number of these fossil viral elements have also been related to carcinogenesis. However, a relation between endoretroviruses expression and chemoresistance has not been reported yet.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty colorectal carcinoma patient samples were scrutinized for HERV-W<sub>E1</sub> and HERV-FRD<sub>1</sub> endoretroviruses using immunohistochemical approaches. In order to search for differential expression of these elements in chemotherapy refractory cells, a resistant HCT8 colon carcinoma subline was developed by serial etoposide exposure. Endoretroviral elements were detected by immunocytochemical staining, qPCR and ELISA. IC<sub>50</sub>-values of antiviral and cytostatic drugs in HCT8 cells were determined by MTT proliferation assay. The antivirals-cytostatics interaction was evaluated by the isobologram method.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this work, we show for the first time that HERV-W<sub>E1</sub>, HERV-FRD<sub>1</sub>, HERV-3<sub>1</sub>, and HERV-V<sub>1</sub> are a) simultaneously expressed in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve colon carcinoma cells and b) upregulated after cytostatic exposure, suggesting that these retroviral elements are intimately related to chemotherapy resistance. We found a number of antiviral drugs to have cytotoxic activity and the ability to force the downregulation of HERV proteins in vitro. We also demonstrate that the use of different antiviral compounds alone or in combination with anticancer agents results in a synergistic antiproliferative effect and downregulation of different endoretroviral elements in highly chemotherapy-resistant colorectal tumor cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Enhanced HERV-expression is associated with chemoresistance in colon carcinomas which can be overcome by antiviral drugs alone or in combination with anticancer drugs.

This chemical stress can force the genesis of cell heterogeneity in the tumor that becomes manifest in its histology, protein expression pattern, and genetic/epigenetic signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, it is known that drug or ionizing radiation exposure can induce the expression of viral elements present in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the relationship between the manifest endoretroviral spectrum and the development of chemotherapy resistance has not been concatenated until now.</p><p>Accounting for 8&#x000a0;% of the human genetic material, human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) represent a footprint of ancestral germ-cell infections in which viruses integrated into the host genome and were transmitted in a Mendelian form to the progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Structurally, HERVs retain all retroviral hallmarks, including the <italic>gal</italic>, <italic>pol &#x00026; env</italic> genes flanked by non-coding long terminal repeats (LTRs). Although most HERVs have lost the capacity of horizontal transmission due to gene defects, some have retained this ability despite their apparent apathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To ensure proliferation, they sequestrate intact elements from co-expressed exoviruses to form functional entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>While organs like ovaries and testes as well as embryonic stem cells express HERV elements abundantly, expression is typically low or non-detectable in somatic cells. Furthermore, it is known that HERV-W significantly contributes to the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts through the fusogenic properties of the syncytins (HERV-W<sub>E1</sub> &#x00026; HERV-FRD), which are products of the viral envelope gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>So far, the contribution of HERVs to normal cell physiology remains largely unstudied. On the other hand, a number of fossil HERVs have been linked to neoplastic transformation that gives rise to breast and small-cell lung carcinomas, renal carcinomas, leukemias, and other malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For example, the overexpression of HERV-H and HERV-V-3 was found to be correlated with the development of colon carcinoma, although any relationship to chemotherapy resistance or tumor aggressiveness has not been reported so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>It was recently demonstrated that iRNA targeting HERV-K can suppress tumor growth in melanoma models, suggesting that the overexpression of particular HERVs may play a crucial role in tumor physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Consequently, interference with these viral elements via antiviral agents could produce antitumoral effects. The introduction of antiviral drugs such as ribavirin into the therapy of tumors with high HERV expression (e.g. refractory AML) has shown complete and partial responses and a reduction in overall levels of eIF4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Nevertheless, the influence of antiviral agents on the expression of these viral elements and their potential anticancer activity has not been reported yet.</p><p>Here, we show that cytostatic stress induces the development of highly resistant, HERV-overexpressing tumor cells. We determine the cytotoxic activity of different antiviral agents and highlight their capacity to shut down HERV expression. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of antiviral compounds and antitumoral drugs reflects synergistic antiproliferative effects in highly resistant, HERV-overexpressing colorectal tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell cultures and patient samples</title><p>HCT8 colon carcinoma cells employed in this study were obtained from the cell and tumor bank of the University of Duisburg-Essen, Medical School.

Briefly, cells in exponential growth phase were harvested, washed with medium, and seeded in 96-well plates at appropriate densities according to their growth kinetics. After a conditioning period of 24&#x000a0;hours, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of cytostatics for 72&#x000a0;hours. The cultures were then incubated with MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) dissolved in PBS at a final concentration of 1&#x000a0;mg/ml for 4&#x000a0;hours. Supernatants were aspirated and the purple formazan crystals dissolved in 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of solubilization solution (10&#x000a0;% SDS in DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). The absorbance was measured in a microtiter plate reader (Infinite F200 Tecan, Berlin, Germany) at 570&#x000a0;nm. Both methods were formerly described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Resistance to etoposide in HCT8 cells was induced in the same form previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Briefly, IC<sub>50</sub> values for cytostatics were determined by MTT assay. Exponentially growing cells were then exposed to 2&#x000d7; IC<sub>50</sub> for 24&#x000a0;hours. For recovery, cells were washed and incubated with drug-free culture medium until new colonies had formed. This procedure was repeated several times, each time doubling the original IC<sub>50</sub> until 64&#x000d7; IC<sub>50</sub> was reached. The surviving cells were subjected to a resistance selection by incubation with increasing concentrations of the respective drugs (16&#x000d7; to 512&#x000d7; IC<sub>50</sub>) for 24&#x000a0;hours. Cells which proliferated at higher drug concentrations (128&#x000d7;) within one week were considered chemotherapy refractory. Resistant colonies were then expanded in the continuous presence of cytostatics and used for molecular-biological analysis, in particular for studying the expression of CSC features. The resistance factor (RF) was determined by MTT proliferation assay and reported as the IC<sub>50</sub> iCSCs/ IC<sub>50</sub> parental ratio. Using etoposide as chemoresistance-inducer it is feasible to induce a wide HCT8 subpopulation of cells (HCT8<sup>RETO</sup>) with cancer stem cell features (CSCs) in a very short time.
