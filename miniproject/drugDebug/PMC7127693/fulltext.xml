Every year, known viruses such as HIV-1 and hepatitis B virus newly infect millions of people across the globe. In addition, recent outbreaks of Ebola virus, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) serve as a reminder of the silent danger. The World Health Organization reported in 2015 that over 1.34 million causalities per year are connected with hepatitis B and almost 500,000 with hepatitis C. Occasional epidemic outbreaks of other viruses are also striking. These include outbreaks of noroviruses, flaviviruses (Zika and dengue viruses), new strains of influenza viruses, the re-emergence of West Nile virus in Italy and the United States. Despite relatively long pauses, viruses such as influenza virus can re-emerge and cause global pandemic health problems.</p><p id="p0025">Unlike cellular genomes, which consist of double-stranded (ds) DNA, viral genomes can be formed by a broad variety of nucleic acids (NAs), including ds or single-stranded (ss) circular or linear DNA or positive-, negative- or sometimes ambi-sense RNA. As viral life cycles are dependent on cellular factors and cellular metabolic and signaling pathways, the number of possible antiviral drug targets is limited. However, almost all viruses encode unique proteins and enzymes that may serve as specific targets for antiviral therapy. The overarching goal of modern drug development efforts is to design compounds that specifically inhibit viral targets or cellular targets essential for virus replication.</p><p id="p0030">The purpose of this review is to provide insight into the broad variety of cell-based and biochemical assays used for identification and evaluation of antivirotics, including high-throughput screening (HTS) methods. An overview of available inhibitors and vaccines, which has been reviewed elsewhere [e.g. in (<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq and Li, 2016</xref>)], is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><sec id="s0010"><label>1.1</label><title>Morphology</title><p id="p0035">To package their genomes into particles of very limited size, viruses encode few genes. Virions consist of an RNA or DNA genome that is protected by an outer shell called a capsid (also nucleocapsid) formed by a lattice of capsid proteins. In enveloped viruses, the capsid is additionally surrounded by a lipid bilayer spiked with viral proteins. The size of animal viruses ranges from approximately 25&#x000a0;nm to over 300&#x000a0;nm (<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>). The capsids and virions of RNA viruses adopt various shapes. Viral capsids may be icosahedral (e.g. <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, <italic>Astroviridae</italic>, <italic>Reoviridae</italic>, <italic>Togaviridae</italic>), bullet-shaped (<italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>), helical (<italic>Coronaviridae</italic>), helical filamentous (<italic>Filoviridae</italic>, <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>), or filamentous (<italic>Arenaviridae</italic>, <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>). The retroviral capsid core may be conical, spherical, or rod-shaped.</p><p id="p0040">The morphology of DNA viruses is similarly diverse, ranging from icosahedral (enveloped - <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic>, <italic>Herpesvridae</italic>; nonenveloped - <italic>Adenoviridae</italic>, <italic>Parvovirdae</italic>, <italic>Polyomaviridae</italic> and <italic>Papillomaviridae</italic>) to rod-shaped (<italic>Baculoviridae</italic>) or pleomorphic (<italic>Poxviridae</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>1.2</label><title>Structure</title><p id="p0045">The viral life cycle is the process of viral replication in a host cell. First, viruses enter the host cell and replicate their genomes. Following translation of viral proteins by the host cell machinery, viruses package their genomic material into protective proteinaceous capsids and exit the cell to infect another host cell. Nonenveloped viruses consist only of a protein capsid shell enclosing the viral genome and enzymes, while the capsid shell of enveloped viruses is enclosed in a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane. Regardless of whether the virus is enveloped, its surface must display (glyco)proteins suitable for specific interactions with host cell receptors. In contrast to the surface proteins of nonenveloped viruses, those of enveloped viruses usually serve another function in addition to host cell recognition and attachment. For example, they may enable fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, usually through an interaction with a secondary receptor(s) or co-receptor(s). The fusion domains of viral surface glycoproteins thus can lower the kinetic barrier for the energetically demanding membrane fusion.</p><p id="p0050">The viral particle must be sufficiently stable to protect the genome until its delivery into the host cell. Simultaneously, it must be metastable, to allow its disassembly and release of the genome for replication in the infected cell at the appropriate time. The energetic barrier that prevents viral disassembly outside the cell is lowered upon infection by structural changes in the viral components. These changes may be induced by binding of a cellular ligand or by changes in the environment, such as pH change upon entering a specific cellular compartment. Numerous viruses preassemble immature particles that undergo irreversible (usually proteolytic) transitions into mature structures of fully infectious virions. Mutual interactions of viral capsid proteins are typically different from those of cellular proteins, which predominantly create binary interactions. Viral structural proteins interact with multiple neighboring partners to form multicomponent macromolecular structures [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Cheng and Brooks, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0835" ref-type="bibr">Jayaraman et al., 2016</xref>)]. The economy of the packaged viral genomes due to the limited capsid size implies formation of only a few types of structural proteins, which are usually symmetrically organized [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb1410" ref-type="bibr">Prasad and Schmid, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb1430" ref-type="bibr">Raguram et al., 2017</xref>)].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2</label><title>Common stages in the viral life cycle</title><p id="p0055">In the initial stage of infection, viruses must overcome several obstacles. The first is the cellular plasma membrane with an actin cortex. Then, they must traffic through dense cytoplasm to reach their final destination for replication and assembly. These pathways are specific for different viruses and often are dictated by the size of the particle and its structure.</p><p id="p0060">The viral life cycle can be divided into several common stages, including entry, uncoating, genome replication, genome packaging and assembly, release, and maturation (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>

This process is common to both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. In enveloped viruses, the binding is mediated by viral surface components, typically oligomers of integral glycoproteins. Nonenveloped viruses bind receptors through sites or projections on the capsid surface. Viruses can use either a single receptor (e.g. TIM-1 for hepatitis A virus, GM1 for SV40, CD155 for poliovirus, low-density lipoprotein receptor for human rhinovirus) or multiple receptors with equivalent roles (e.g., Nectin-1/2 or HVEM for herpes simplex virus 1/2, ACE or L-SIGN for SARS coronavirus). For other viruses (e.g. HIV, HCV, adenoviruses, rotaviruses, picornaviruses, and some herpesviruses), the presence of at least two cytoplasmic membrane components is required. For example, HIV-1 binds to the primary receptor CD4 and one of two co-receptors (CCR5 or CXCR4) [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Cossart and Helenius, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0640" ref-type="bibr">Grove and Marsh, 2011</xref>)].</p><p id="p0070">To infect a cell, viruses must overcome the plasma membrane to deliver their genetic material into the cytosol. Viruses enter cells by two main mechanisms. A majority of animal viruses, both enveloped and nonenveloped, enter cells by one or two types of endocytosis, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (e.g. VSV, influenza A virus, rhinovirus), caveolin-mediated uptake (echovirus, polyoma virus), clathrin/caveolin-independent endocytosis such as caveolar or lipid raft-mediated (e.g. SV40, polyomavirus mouse), or macropinocytosis (e.g. vaccinia virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus, HIV-1) (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Blaas, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Cossart and Helenius, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Fields et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0915" ref-type="bibr">Kirkham and Parton, 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb1160" ref-type="bibr">Marechal et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb1170" ref-type="bibr">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb1200" ref-type="bibr">Mercer and Helenius, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb1345" ref-type="bibr">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb1455" ref-type="bibr">Rasmussen and Vilhardt, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb1515" ref-type="bibr">Saeed et al., 2010</xref>). These endocytic mechanisms enable the virus to be transported by the cell&#x02019;s machinery through the plasma membrane and to pass through the dense actin cortex. Cellular entry of some viruses is coupled with receptor-mediated signaling, resulting in activation of molecules that facilitate virus entry by cytoskeleton reorganization, induction of long-distance transport of the virus-containing vesicles, or actin cortex disassembly. The second type of entry is used by some enveloped viruses (paramyxo-, herpes-, and retroviruses), which upon cell surface receptor binding, infect the cell by direct fusion of viral and plasma membranes at neutral pH.</p><p id="p0075">Upon internalization, most viruses become trapped and enclosed in vesicles that pinch off the inner side of the plasma membrane and transport their cargo into the cytoplasm. On their way through the cell, these transport vesicles undergo maturation by fusing with other vesicles. To fulfill their task of genome replication, viruses have to escape from these endosomes. The &#x0201c;great escape&#x0201d; is triggered by activation of a fusion or penetration mechanism, such as changes in conditions in the endosomal interior [e.g. pH, ionic environment (e.g. calcium ion concentration), oxido-reducing conditions], changes in membrane composition, and other physico-chemical cues (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Blaas, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Cossart and Helenius, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0795" ref-type="bibr">Inoue and Tsai, 2013</xref>). Depending on the requirements for a particular virus, these events can occur in early endosomes (pH 6.5&#x02013;6.0; e.g. hepatitis C virus, vesicular stomatitis virus), late endosomes (pH 6.0&#x02013;5.0; e.g. influenza A virus, dengue virus, SARS coronavirus), recycling endosomes, macropinosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes (pH 5.0&#x02013;4.5) (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Blaas, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Cossart and Helenius, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0640" ref-type="bibr">Grove and Marsh, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0795" ref-type="bibr">Inoue and Tsai, 2013</xref>). For the majority of animal viruses, the activation of these fusion or penetration mechanisms occurs through conformational changes and structural rearrangements in viral surface proteins and/or the whole virion shell that may destabilize the capsid core. Structural rearrangements in enveloped viruses usually mediate fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. In nonenveloped viruses, the structural changes uncover amphipathic or hydrophobic domains that may induce pore formation or disruption of endosomal membranes. To deliver genetic material to the replication site, these mechanisms ultimately release viral capsid structures from endosomal vesicles into the cytosol either by fusing with the endosomal membrane (enveloped viruses) or by penetrating the endosomal membrane (nonenveloped viruses).</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.2</label><title>Uncoating</title><p id="p0080">Uncoating is the partial or complete disassembly of the protective capsid shell and/or lipid envelope to liberate the viral genome. For many viruses, this process is closely connected with conformational changes induced by the virus binding to the cell surface receptor; a low pH environment; or changes in oxido-reducing conditions, ion concentrations, or other factors. For enveloped viruses, uncoating involves a loss of the viral membrane by fusion either with the plasma membrane or with intracellular vesicles, followed by stepwise uncoating of the protective capsid shell. In nonenveloped viruses, the uncoating process typically involves conformational changes that result in the weakening of intermolecular interactions, loss of structural proteins, proteolytic cleavage, and so on (<xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Fields and Knipe, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0085">Depending on the virus, uncoating can take place at the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm, during endocytosis in early or late endosomes, in lysosomes, in the nucleus, or at the nuclear pore complex (NPC).</p><p id="p0090">The ssRNA genome of retroviruses, which is fully enclosed inside a protective capsid shell, must be reverse transcribed into dsDNA and released from the capsid. Although it is accepted that HIV-1 uncoating is linked to reverse transcription and nuclear import (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Ambrose and Aiken, 2014</xref>) and is controlled by host factors (e.g. cyclophilin A, TRIM5&#x003b1;), the precise molecular mechanisms that trigger the uncoating remain unknown. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including breakage of the capsid shell due to increased inner pressure caused by accumulation of the reverse transcription product (<xref rid="bb1450" ref-type="bibr">Rankovic et al., 2017</xref>), the requirement of intact microtubules and dynein and kinesin motors (<xref rid="bb1110" ref-type="bibr">Lukic et al., 2014</xref>), and phosphorylation of capsid shell protein by the host cell kinase MELK (<xref rid="bb1650" ref-type="bibr">Takeuchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.3</label><title>Entry into the nucleus</title><p id="p0095">In contrast to the majority of RNA viruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm, most DNA viruses (with the exception of large DNA viruses including <italic>Poxviridae</italic>, <italic>Asfarviridae</italic>, and <italic>Mimiviridae</italic>) and several negative stranded RNA viruses enter the nucleus to replicate their genomes (<xref rid="bb0925" ref-type="bibr">Kobiler et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0940" ref-type="bibr">Koonin and Yutin, 2010</xref>). Passive diffusion into the nucleus is suitable for molecules smaller than 9&#x000a0;nm in diameter, but larger structures must enter through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which can accommodate molecules of up to 39&#x000a0;nm (<xref rid="bb1330" ref-type="bibr">Pante and Kann, 2002</xref>). Translocation through the NPC is tightly regulated and requires the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) on the passing molecule and nuclear import receptors (importins or karyopherins) (<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Cautain et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0100">Due to the diversity of viral particle sizes (from 25&#x000a0;nm to over 300&#x000a0;nm) and structures, viruses have evolved several strategies to export their DNA or RNA genome into the nucleoplasm. With regard to the NPC, these pathways can be divided into NPC-dependent and NPC-independent mechanisms. Due to size limitations, only a few, very small viral capsid particles, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV; 32&#x02013;36&#x000a0;nm diameter), can pass through the NPC (<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb1425" ref-type="bibr">Rabe et al., 2003</xref>) in an importin-dependent manner. HBV then disassembles at the nuclear side of the NPC (the nuclear basket), releasing its genome into the nucleoplasm (<xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">Fay and Pant&#x000e9;, 2015</xref>). The capsid shells or ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) of some larger viruses, such as influenza A virus and HIV-1, disassemble within the cytoplasm. The viral genome, released from the shell and complexed with NLS-containing components, is then translocated through the NPC (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Ambrose and Aiken, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Hope, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">Fay and Pant&#x000e9;, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0785" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson and Fodor, 2013</xref>). Another mechanism, used by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and adenoviruses, involves cellular (importins, Nup) or viral protein-mediated attachment (docking) of the capsid shell at the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. This facilitates the passage of genomic DNA into the NPC either by ejection from an almost intact particle (through the capsid portal in HSV-1) or upon complete disassembly of the capsid shell (in adenoviruses) (<xref rid="bb0945" ref-type="bibr">Kremer and Nemerow, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb1295" ref-type="bibr">Ojala et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bb1350" ref-type="bibr">Pasdeloup et al., 2009</xref>). NPC-independent mechanisms are used by some retroviruses (e.g. MLV) that enter the nucleus during the mitotic phase of the cell division cycle when the nuclear envelope is dissolved (<xref rid="bb1165" ref-type="bibr">Matreyek and Engelman, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb1485" ref-type="bibr">Roe et al., 1993</xref>).

Among them, there are proteins of RNA-replication machinery that recruit (+)RNA into a membrane-associated replication complex. The genomic RNA is replicated by using (&#x02013;)RNA template, which is transcribed in a low copy number Amplified (+)RNA is then packaged into newly assembled virions that exit the host cell either through secretion or cell lysis.</p><p>B: Upon the virus attachment, a core containing both gRNA and virus encoded RNA polymerase is delivered into the cytoplasm by endocytosis. Cytoplasmic transcription of the (&#x02013;)RNA template provides (+)RNA that serves as mRNA for translation of viral proteins. In dsRNA viruses, the (+)RNA is packaged into new cores which undergo maturation by synthesizing (&#x02013;)RNA (dotted strand) and acquiring surface proteins. In the (&#x02013;)RNA viruses, the (+)RNA strand is transcribed into genomic (&#x02013;)RNA in the cytoplasm and then packaged. The new virions egress the cell either through secretion or cell lysis.</p><p>C: Following fusion of viral and cell plasma membrane, the retroviral core is released into cytosol, RNA genome is transcribed into dsDNA by viral reverse transcriptase concomitantly with uncoating of the viral core, ds DNA is transferred into nucleus where it is integrated into host cell genome by viral integrase, following translation of retroviral structural and enzymatic polyproteins, the unspliced gRNA is packaged into the immature particles that usually assemble at the plasma membrane and the viral particles bud from the cell.</p><p>D: Three mechanisms (I.-III.) of DNA viruses replication are shown: (I): Following entry and uncoating, the DNA genome is transported to the nucleus; products of early genes (regulatory proteins, transcription factors) regulate the synthesis of viral enzymes (e.g. DNA polymerase) required for genome replication; expression of late genes encoding structural capsid proteins in the cytosol, they are then transported into nucleus where packaging and pre-assembly take place; preassembled procapsids exit the nucleus and leave the cell (e.g. Herpesviruses). (II) unique replication cycle of Hepatitis B virus (HBV): following entry, the viral particle is internalized by endocytosis and the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm; the genome (relaxed circular rcDNA) is transported into the nucleus, where it is converted to a covalently closed circular form (cccDNA); which serves as a template for transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) for translation of the core protein and the viral polymerase and three subgenomic mRNAs used for translation of regulatory and envelope proteins; following viral transcription and translation, the HBV core proteins self-assemble in the cytoplasm into viral nucleocapsid with concurrent incorporation of pgRNA and HBV polymerase, pgRNA is reversely transcribed into a rcDNA within the nucleocapsid; nucleocapsid containing rcDNA can either re-enter the nucleus to amplify cccDNA, or can be enveloped by HBV envelope proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. The particles are then secreted from the infected hepatocyte by exocytosis.

The genome of (+)RNA viruses may serve directly as mRNA for production of viral proteins. Therefore, the mere introduction of genetic material (e.g. in exocytic vesicles) may result in productive infection. The RNA polymerases that copy the genetic material of RNA viruses are error-prone, which provides considerable genetic flexibility and the propensity to evolve drug-resistant mutants. These features are amplified in viruses with segmented genomes that undergo reassortment.</p><p id="p0120">In viruses with segmented genomes (<italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> and <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), each segment is transcribed in an autonomous transcription-replication unit by viral RNA polymerase that binds to the 5&#x02032; end cap structure. Of note, the genomic RNA (gRNA) is capped by a unique mechanism called cap-snatching (<xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2017</xref>), in which the cap is cleaved from cellular mRNA and transferred onto the viral gRNA by a subunit of viral RNA polymerase (<xref rid="bb1370" ref-type="bibr">Pflug et al., 2017</xref>). Some dsRNA viruses (<italic>Birnaviridae</italic> and <italic>Reoviridae</italic>) also contain segmented genomes. Upon replication, these viruses must ensure stoichiometric incorporation of single copies of each gRNA segment into new particles. This is guided by specific packaging signals on each segment of gRNA that interact with positively charged domains in the capsid proteins [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb0800" ref-type="bibr">Isel et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb1400" ref-type="bibr">Pohl et al., 2016</xref>)]. Although different models of packaging have been proposed for various segmented genome viruses, a common feature is co-assembly of the capsid proteins with the gRNA and RNA polymerase.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>2.4.2</label><title>Replication of DNA viruses</title><p id="p0125">The genomes of DNA viruses come in a considerable variety of sizes and shapes, from small ss to large ds molecules that may be linear or circular. The size range of these genomes (from 1.8&#x000a0;kb to 1200&#x000a0;kb) reflects the necessity for some viruses to encode specific proteins required for viral replication. Small-genome DNA viruses (polyoma-, papilloma-, and parvoviruses) use only host cell enzymes for replication and transcription. The only exceptions are some hepadnaviruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus) that despite having small genomes (approximately 3&#x000a0;kb), encode their own specific DNA polymerase/reverse transcriptase that reverse transcribes pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) into genomic viral DNA (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D, II) (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Beck and Nassal, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="p0130">Viruses with intermediate-size genomes (up to 35&#x000a0;kb) (e.g. adenoviruses) encode their own DNA polymerase for genome replication, but they usually utilize cellular RNA polymerases II and III for transcription (<xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Fields and Knipe, 2013</xref>). Viruses with large genomes (larger than 100&#x000a0;kb) (e.g. herpesviruses) encode proteins for replication, including DNA polymerase and DNA helicase-primase, as well as some enzymes necessary for biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and several transcription factors (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Boehmer and Nimonkar, 2003</xref>). Poxviruses (e.g. vaccinia virus), are another type of virus with large dsDNA genomes, and their replication, transcription, and translation take place entirely in the cytoplasm within discrete juxtanuclear sites called virus factories (<xref rid="bb1245" ref-type="bibr">Moss, 2013</xref>), (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D, III). These viruses encode all enzymes and specific factors necessary for genomic replication and transcription. With their own replicative machinery, large-genome DNA viruses can replicate in nondividing cells. In contrast, the replication of small-genome DNA viruses, which depends on cellular DNA polymerases, must occur simultaneously with the S-phase of the cell cycle (e.g. parvoviruses), or must express some viral protein/oncogene to re-program the host cell-cycle regulatory proteins p53 or retinoblastoma protein (pRb), triggering entry into the S-phase (e.g. polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses). By affecting the G1/S checkpoint (controlled by p53 and pRb), the viruses ensure the production of host enzymes required for viral replication (<xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Fields and Knipe, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0135">Production of viral proteins of DNA viruses with intermediate and large size genomes is divided into early and late phases. In the early (prereplicative) phase, nonstructural proteins required for DNA replication are translated. The late phase, during which the late structural proteins needed for assembly are translated, begins after viral DNA replication (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D, I).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>2.5</label><title>Assembly</title><p id="p0140">Depending on the species, viruses assemble either in contact with the cellular membrane or independent of the membrane in either the nucleus or cytoplasm. The membrane-independent route is used by nonenveloped viruses and a few enveloped viruses (e.g. orthomyxoviruses, herpesviruses, and some retroviruses) that acquire the membrane envelope after intracellular assembly during budding from the cell.</p><sec id="s0060"><label>2.5.1</label><title>Assembly in the nucleus</title><p id="p0145">The limiting step for nuclear assembly is the size of NPCs, which are large enough to transport RNA and import proteins required for assembly into the nucleus; however, NPC size limits the transport of larger assemblies. Therefore, some viruses form assembly intermediates in the nucleus. These structures are then exported to the cytoplasm, where they come together to form viral particles. Nuclear export is specific and depends on the presence of nuclear export signals (NES) in the transported proteins. One example of a nonenveloped icosahedral virus that assembles in the nucleus is adenovirus, the assembly of which has been studied intensely due to its potential use in gene therapies [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Ahi and Mittal, 2016</xref>)]. Recent data suggest that upon accumulation of multiple copies of adenoviral dsDNA genomes, coordinated assembly and packaging occur by two interlinked mechanisms that involve both capsid proteins and core components (<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Condezo and San Mart&#x000ed;n, 2017</xref>). The assembly occurs in the so-called peripheral replicative zone with the assistance of scaffolding proteins that facilitate formation of adenoviral particles but are excluded from mature viruses. Adenoviruses are finally released upon lysis of the infected host cell.</p><p id="p0150">Orthomyxoviruses and herpesviruses are enveloped viruses that assemble their nucleoproteins in the nucleus. Herpesviruses package their dsDNA genome as head-to-tail concatemers and assemble icosahedral procapsids on scaffold proteins in the nucleus [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb0720" ref-type="bibr">Heming et al., 2017</xref>)]. However, subsequent steps of herpesvirus assembly proceed in the cytoplasm. The preassembled procapsid is too large to pass through the NPC, but it exits the nucleus by viral protein-driven vesicular transport across the nuclear inner membrane leaflet. Thus, the herpesvirus acquires an initial envelope from the inner nuclear membrane [for review see (<xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Fields et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0715" ref-type="bibr">Hellberg et al., 2016</xref>)]. Next, the herpesviral membrane fuses with the outer nuclear membrane, and the naked particle is released from the nucleus into the cytosol. Here, the virus acquires tegument (a protein layer between the capsid and the envelope) and other proteins. Final herpesvirus envelopment occurs at the Golgi membrane containing the viral glycoproteins (<xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Fields and Knipe, 2013</xref>). Preassembled orthomyxoviral ribonucleoproteins, upon their export from the nucleus, are driven to the plasma membrane to which they attach through electrostatic interactions of the matrix protein M1 with membrane phosphatidylserine. The virions then assemble simultaneously with budding during which they also acquire HA, NA and M2 membrane proteins. Poxviruses undergo an even more complicated pathway. They are enveloped with multiple membranes acquired from ER/intermediate compartments and Golgi or early endosomes (<xref rid="bb1250" ref-type="bibr">Moss, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb1255" ref-type="bibr">Moss, 2016</xref>). These membranes also provide the poxviruses with their membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>2.5.2</label><title>Assembly in the cytoplasm</title><p id="p0155">Most viruses assemble upon interaction of their structural proteins with cellular membranes. The target membrane for assembly differs according to the virus type. Flaviviruses assemble at the surface of the ER and then upon their budding into the ER lumen, the immature particles are then transported into the TGN. Some viruses, such as coronaviruses, assemble at the ER&#x02013;Golgi intermediate compartment [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb1725" ref-type="bibr">Ujike and Taguchi, 2015</xref>)]. The assembly of bunyaviruses occurs concurrently with replication of gRNA segments in virus factories located along the Golgi (<xref rid="bb0655" ref-type="bibr">Guu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb1615" ref-type="bibr">Strandin et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of membrane glycoproteins at the Golgi membrane determines the sites where assembling bunyavirus particles bud into the Golgi lumen, similar to other enveloped viruses.</p><p id="p0160">Numerous viruses, including paramyxoviruses (<xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Plemper, 2017</xref>), orthomyxoviruses (<xref rid="bb1400" ref-type="bibr">Pohl et al., 2016</xref>), alphaviruses (<xref rid="bb0865" ref-type="bibr">Jose et al., 2009</xref>), rhabdoviruses (<xref rid="bb1305" ref-type="bibr">Okumura and Harty, 2011</xref>), and most retroviruses (<xref rid="bb0530" ref-type="bibr">Freed, 2015</xref>), assemble underneath the cytoplasmic membrane, which facilitates assembly by providing a scaffolding function. The virus then acquires a lipid envelope through budding across the plasma membrane. During this process, it also gains the envelope glycoproteins (Env) that are anchored in the plasma membrane by hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Env reaches the plasma membrane by a cellular secretory pathway upon synthesis in the ER and subsequent glycosylation in the Golgi. Usually, a specific interaction between viral structural proteins and glycoproteins is required. This may be either direct or mediated through the interaction with matrix protein (e.g. in (&#x02013;)RNA viruses such as ortho- and paramyxoviruses or rhabdoviruses). Most retroviruses, including HIV (so-called morphogenetic C-type), also assemble at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The interaction of the structural polyprotein precursor (Gag) with the plasma membrane is usually facilitated by a bipartite signal in the N-terminal domain of Gag (i.e. matrix protein) comprising both the basic patch and N-terminally linked myristoyl residue (added co-translationally to Gag). In contrast to C-type assembly at the membrane, morphogenetic B/D-type retroviruses assemble at pericentriolar sites where Gag polyproteins are transported along microtubules by dynein molecular motors (<xref rid="bb1560" ref-type="bibr">Sfakianos et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb1745" ref-type="bibr">Vlach et al., 2008</xref>).

This mechanism, which is an irreversible step in the virus life cycle, ensures equimolar packaging of structural proteins and proportional co-assembly of viral enzymes in the form of precursors. Upon proteolytic release, the liberated proteins may undergo different trafficking pathways or fulfill various functions in the virus. Maturation changes the energy of interaction forces among those interfaces required for intracellular assembly of immature particles to those suitable for viral stability in the environment and for disassembly and uncoating of genetic material for replication [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb1740" ref-type="bibr">Veesler and Johnson, 2012</xref>)].</p><p id="p0180">In poliovirus, the autocatalytic and subsequent viral protease-mediated cleavage of P1 precursor protein allows formation of pentamers that interact with gRNA.

This is a controlled process that involves both viral protein domains and cellular factors. During this process, viruses apparently use cellular machinery similar to that used during the last step of cell division (the release of the daughter cell) called endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Campsteijn et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0780" ref-type="bibr">Hurley, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb1310" ref-type="bibr">Olmos and Carlton, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb1545" ref-type="bibr">Scourfield and Martin-Serrano, 2017</xref>)].

In 1982, Burroughs-Wellcome introduced acyclovir as an inhibitor of herpesviruses. Its remarkable specificity is connected with its activation by viral thymidine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation. However, due to development of drug resistance in a number of viruses, especially RNA viruses, there is a continuous need to design and test new inhibitors, preferably targeting different steps of viral life cycles.

In enveloped viruses, entry is initiated by fusion of the viral envelope with the target cellular membrane. The entry mechanism has been well-described for HIV-1, in which it is mediated by Env glycoprotein, consisting of transmembrane gp41 and surface gp120 subunits. Binding of gp120 to its cellular receptor, CD4, and to one of two co-receptors, CXCR4 or CCR5, triggers a refolding of gp41 that promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The refolding involves oligomerization of the extracellular N- and C-terminal heptad repeat (HR) domains of gp41, which leads to the formation of a 6-helical bundle [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb1190" ref-type="bibr">Melikyan, 2008</xref>)].</p><p id="p0230">Jiang et al. established an <italic>in vitro</italic> system to quantify formation of the HIV-1 gp41 6-helical bundle (<xref rid="bb0850" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1999</xref>). In their system, the bundle is formed by mixing equimolar concentrations of peptides derived from the N- and C-HR regions of gp41. ELISA using the monoclonal antibody NC-1, which specifically recognizes and binds an epitope formed on the gp41 6-helix bundle but not the individual peptides, enables screening for compounds that prevent formation of fusion-active gp41. For HTS of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, this method was modified to use a fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA), in which the C-HR peptide was replaced with FITC-conjugated C-HR peptide (<xref rid="bb1085" ref-type="bibr">Boyer-Chatenet et al., 2003</xref>)<bold>.</bold>
</p><p id="p0235">Cell-based assays are routinely used to screen viral entry inhibitors. High throughput formats have been developed for screening of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. Cell-cell fusion assays involve two types of cells: effector cells that stably (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al., 2004</xref>) or inducibly (<xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">Herschhorn et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0845" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2006</xref>) express HIV-Env glycoprotein and target cells that express CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5. Co-cultivation of these cells leads to HIV-1 Env-mediated cell membrane fusion, resulting in formation of multinucleated syncytia. Membrane fusion induces expression of a reporter protein such as luciferase (<xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">Herschhorn et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0845" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2006</xref>) or &#x003b2;-galactosidase (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al., 2004</xref>). One such assay enables determination of both the efficiency and specificity of fusion inhibitors (<xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">Herschhorn et al., 2011</xref>). This approach uses effector cells that express both HIV-1 Env and the Renilla luciferase (R-Luc) reporter protein using inducible tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) and target cells that express the HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5) and contain the firefly luciferase (F-Luc) reporter gene under the control of a tTA-responsive promoter. Upon fusion of the effector and target cells, tTA enters the target cells and activates the expression of the F-Luc reporter. The inhibition of fusion of cellular membranes is determined as a decrease in F-Luc luminescence, and the inhibitor specificity is measured as the R-Luc activity (<xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">Herschhorn et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="p0240">Based on an HIV-1 cell-cell fusion method that uses a computer-controlled digital image analysis system for automatic quantitation (<xref rid="bb1100" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2003</xref>), a modified method was developed to screen inhibitors targeting MERS-CoV S protein (<xref rid="bb1105" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2014</xref>).

One such approach is based on production of chimeric HIV-1 virions carrying &#x003b2;-lactamase&#x02013;Vpr chimeric protein (BlaM-Vpr). Chimeric HIV released into the cell culture media is isolated by ultracentrifugation and used to infect target cells. Entry of the virions into the cytoplasm is detected by cleavage of a fluorescent substrate by &#x003b2;-lactamase. The fluorescence shift corresponds to the fusion efficacy and is measurable by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, or fluorometric plate reader (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Cavrois et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Cavrois et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Cavrois et al., 2014</xref>).

HTS assays for inhibitors of HIV-1 assembly include several methods using purified HIV-1 CA or CA-NC proteins. One of them, the turbidimetric assay, is based on the observation that direct dilution of the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) into a high-salt solution (1.6&#x02013;2.2&#x000a0;M NaCl) leads to the formation of tubular structures. As the tube formation is accompanied by an increase in light scattering, assembly can be detected as an increase in turbidity, and the rate of turbidity change is proportional to the rate of the assembly (<xref rid="bb0975" ref-type="bibr">Lanman et al., 2002</xref>). Other method published by Lemke et al., exploits the affinity of nucleocapsid (NC) to a short TG-rich deoxyribooligonucleotide, d(TG25), which is used as a scaffold (<xref rid="bb1010" ref-type="bibr">Lemke et al., 2012</xref>). This arrangement enables CA to assemble at much lower protein and salt concentrations than in the turbidimetric assay (<xref rid="bb0975" ref-type="bibr">Lanman et al., 2002</xref>). Biotin-labeled d(TG25) bound on the surface of neutravidin-coated microtiter well plates nucleates assembly of complexes of CA-NC and soluble fluorescein-labeled d(TG25). Fluorescence is measured after washing to remove the unbound and unassembled material from the captured assembly products (<xref rid="bb1010" ref-type="bibr">Lemke et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the FAITH assay uses a dually labeled oligonucleotide (tqON). However, in this case, the ssDNA oligonucleotide tqON is labeled with the reporter dye fluorescein (FAM) as well as Black Hole Quencher (BHQ); thus, it does not emit any fluorescence. The assembly reaction is triggered by mixing HIV-1 CA-NC or a Gag-truncated assembly-competent version with tqON. Following incubation, during which tqON is incorporated into the particles, exonuclease is added to degrade unbound tqON, while co-assembled tqON is protected from cleavage. Degradation of free unbound tqON with <italic>Exo</italic>I results in separation of FAM from its quencher, and the emitted fluorescence is measured (<xref rid="bb0665" ref-type="bibr">Hadravova et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0405">Phage display has been employed to screen peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 assembly (<xref rid="bb1610" ref-type="bibr">Sticht et al., 2005</xref>). A commercial library of M13-derived phages presenting random 12-amino-acid peptides was analyzed for specific binding to purified CA or CA-NC proteins.

The primary screen uses fluorescence polarization (FP), while the secondary one uses differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF).

The majority of viral proteases specifically cleave viral polyprotein precursors to liberate the functional proteins of the virion.

This triggers conformational changes required for interaction with cellular receptors and membrane fusion in enveloped viruses. Some viruses use proteases other than furin to modulate their infectivity, as shown for viruses entering airway epithelial cells [reviewed in (<xref rid="bb0980" ref-type="bibr">Laporte and Naesens, 2017</xref>)] such as influenza virus (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;ttcher-Friebertsh&#x000e4;user et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0950" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;hn et al., 2016</xref>), Newcastle disease virus (<xref rid="bb0600" ref-type="bibr">Gotoh et al., 1992</xref>), and respiratory syncytial virus (<xref rid="bb1630" ref-type="bibr">Sugrue et al., 2001</xref>).

Classical methods use synthetic peptides that mimic the target sites of the protease.

A general determination of infectivity, such as a plaque cytotoxicity assay in the presence of protease inhibitor, may be used for confirmation. One elegant example exploits the cytotoxicity of HIV protease. Cells are transfected with a protease precursor fused to GFP. In the absence of inhibitor, HIV-1 protease is autocatalytically activated and cleaves a broad variety of cellular proteins, resulting in activation of apoptosis and cell death (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Cummins and Badley, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb1500" ref-type="bibr">Rumlova et al., 2014</xref>). This toxic effect, when suppressed by active inhibitors, results in production of a GFP signal in surviving cells (<xref rid="bb1075" ref-type="bibr">Lindsten et al., 2001</xref>). Another elegant approach for HIV and coxsackievirus B3 proteases, which both undergo autocatalytic cleavage, employs constructs in which the protease gene is inserted between sequences encoding the DNA-binding domain and the domain that activates transcription of the GAL1-lacZ reporter gene (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Dasmahapatra et al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bb1270" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 1993</xref>). The protease-mediated cleavage separates the DNA-binding domain from the trans-activating domain and results in failure of reporter gene transcription. This approach has also been modified with GFP as a reporter gene (<xref rid="bb0735" ref-type="bibr">Hilton and Wolkowicz, 2010</xref>). Co-expression of cleavage-activated luciferase substrate and MERS-CoV protease permits both live-cell imaging and quantification of the enzyme activity (<xref rid="bb0910" ref-type="bibr">Kilianski et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0135"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0435">The need to develop new antiviral compounds will likely persist over the long term, although there has been enormous progress in molecular biology methods, especially RNA silencing, bioinformatics, imaging, and structural biology techniques.
