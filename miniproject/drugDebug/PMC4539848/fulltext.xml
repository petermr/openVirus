Context</title><p>At present, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is an important public health problem worldwide. Hepatitis B can lead to serious liver diseases, including cirrhosis, liver cancer. In China, approximately 120 million people are infected with the Hepatitis B Virus (<xref rid="A29052R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Alavian et al. reported that about 1 million people are infected with HBV in Iran, and 15% to 40% of the patients with hepatitis B may develop cirrhosis or liver cancer (<xref rid="A29052R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Liver fibrosis is a healing response, but the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the liver often leads to severe forms of liver fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis with liver dysfunction (<xref rid="A29052R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="A29052R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Early cirrhosis may be reversible. Therefore, prompt diagnosis and intervention are critical in limiting disease progression (<xref rid="A29052R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Clinically, the existing hepatoprotective agents include Ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA), silibinin, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC).</p><p>UDCA is a hydrophilic bile acid, which alters the ratio of hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic components in the bile acid pool. It promotes the secretion of endogenous bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic and lithocholic acid, and improves cholestasis. UDCA is mainly used to treat primary biliary cirrhosis, hepatitis B associated liver fibrosis, and cholestatic liver disease, the efficacy is certain. Some studies reported that UDCA protects liver cell membrane and enhances immune function. These mechanisms may be related to the ability of ursodeoxycholic acid to regulate cell cycle, apoptosis and protein biosynthesis of liver cells. Alternatively, the increased pool of hydrophilic bile acid and the stability of the cell membrane may play an important protective role (<xref rid="A29052R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="A29052R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). UDCA, which causes minimal damage and is non-toxic to liver cells, is an effective hepatoprotective agent and cholagogue (<xref rid="A29052R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Results of long-term observational studies showed that ursodeoxycholic acid can significantly reduce the development of hepatic fibrosis (<xref rid="A29052R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="A29052R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="A29052R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Silibinin is derived from milk thistle, an important medicinal plant that is roots, leaves and seeds exert a variety of therapeutic effects, including hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-lipogenic properties (<xref rid="A29052R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In the United States and Europe, about 65% of patients with liver disease use Chinese medical preparations which include milk thistle as their most common ingredient (<xref rid="A29052R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Silymarin, a mixture of flavonoids and wood ester pigment compounds, is extracted from milk thistle seeds. Silymarin contains silibinin, silychristin, and silymarin Ning with a large amount of silibinin. it is noteworthy that, silibinin is the main active ingredient of silymarin (<xref rid="A29052R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In recent years, silibinin has been used to treat liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, liver fibrosis and alcoholic liver disease (<xref rid="A29052R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an intracellular glutathione precursor, which can enhance the activity of glutathione transferase and promote the detoxification of free radicals. nitric oxide (NO) and its metabolite can improve microcirculation, increase tissue oxygen, and enhance the repair of damaged tissue (<xref rid="A29052R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="A29052R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In recent years, clinical studies have demonstrated that NAC is not only effective to treat liver failure caused by excessive acetaminophen (paracetamol), but is also useful for liver disease arising from other causes (<xref rid="A29052R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). NAC reduces serum Total Bilirubin (TBil) and aminotransferases, and increases Prothrombin activity (PTA) in patients with severe chronic hepatitis B (<xref rid="A29052R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec110784"><title>2.

Combination therapy was more effective than a single hepatoprotective agent to reduce liver cell damage, promote the liver cell membrane and promote the recovery of liver function, and it may delay the formation and development of hepatic fibrosis (<xref rid="A29052R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Some studies showed a synergistic effect between hepatoprotective agents and antiviral drugs. It may be related to the improvement in drug tolerance due to hepatoprotective agents in patients with hepatitis B (<xref rid="A29052R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="A29052R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In 2006, Qureshi et al reported that large doses of ursodeoxycholic acid reduces ALT levels in patients with hepatitis B (<xref rid="A29052R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The meta-analysis of the current study showed that acetylcysteine, ursodeoxycholic acid and silibinin significantly reduced ALT, and were a liver function marker in patients with hepatitis B. The reduction in ALT levels by acetylcysteine was better than ursodeoxycholic acid and silibinin. This may be related to the ability of acetylcysteine to inhibit the expression of serum II-18, IFN-&#x003b3; and NO in the patients with hepatitis B. Some studies stated that acetylcysteine should be used, and that it was more beneficial in early stages of liver disease (<xref rid="A29052R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>The limitations of the study included the retrospective nature, variability of the quantity, quality and sources of the hepatoprotective agents, and the variability, and effectiveness of the antiviral agents. High-quality multi-center, large sample, randomized, double-blind and controlled clinical trials are necessary to confirm the current observations.</p><p>In conclusion, hepatoprotective drugs can effectively improve serum liver markers in patients with liver fibrosis when combined with antiviral or other hepatoprotective agents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The current work was supported by
