<p id="Par3">Sporadic cases of Influenza occur throughout the year. Transmission of the virus depends on two important environmental factors – temperature and humidity. Epidemics in temperate zones generally occur in dry and cold winters as the influenza virus is known to be more stable in cold with greatest transmission at 5 °C and least above 30 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However these transmission dynamics cannot be applied to tropical countries where the average humidity and temperatures are higher and epidemics are observed during the monsoons. Diurnal variations in humidity and temperature and household exposures have been postulated as possible mechanisms in these regions though the exact reasons for monsoon peaks in tropics remain elusive [
