<p id="Par6">Influenza viruses A, B and C belong to Orthomyxoviridae family and are enveloped negative strand RNA viruses. Negative means they have opposite polarity of the RNA that forms template for protein synthesis required for their viral replication. Though the three viruses have a common genetic ancestry, genetic reassortment is limited to within each specific virus genus and not across the types.</p>
