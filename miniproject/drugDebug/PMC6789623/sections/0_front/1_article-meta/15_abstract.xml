 <p>Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging global swine virus that has a propensity for interspecies transmission. It was identified in Hong Kong in 2012. Given that neither specific antiviral drugs nor vaccines are available for newly emerging porcine deltacoronavirus, searching for effective antiviral drugs is a high priority. In this study, lithium chloride (LiCl) and diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), which are host-acting antivirals (HAAs), were tested against PDCoV. We found that LiCl and DG inhibited PDCoV replication in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral effects of LiCl and DG occurred at the early stage of PDCoV replication, and DG also inhibited virus attachment to the cells. Moreover, both drugs inhibited PDCoV-induced apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells. This study suggests LiCl and DG as new drugs for the treatment of PDCoV infection.</p>
