 </xref> found that human primary astrocytes are more susceptible to ZIKV infection than several other human cell types, including fetal microglia, fetal neuron, and neural progenitor cells. Using ZIKV infection of astrocytes as a screening assay, they identified rilpivirine as a ZIKV inhibitor from eight FDA-approved HIV nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase drugs. Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside inhibitor and suppressed ZIKV RNA replication by ∼70% at 5 μM concentration. The higher susceptibility of astrocytes than other cell types to ZIKV infection is intriguing because previous studies suggested that ZIKV preferentially infected human neural progenitor cells.

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> understanding the susceptible cell types in human brains is essential to gauge potential adverse effect caused by non-specific infection and killing of non-tumor cells. It remains to be tested if rilpivirine also inhibits closely related flaviviruses, such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Nevertheless, the authors have established the antiviral activity of rilpivirine against ZIKV in cell culture.
