Since the early 70s, viruses have played a pivotal role in the discovery and structural characterization of the RNA cap (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
), as well as in the mechanistic elucidation of the RNA capping pathway. Incidentally, virus families for which these discoveries were made (<italic>Reoviridae</italic> and <italic>Poxviridae</italic>) use an RNA capping pathway that turned out to be the same as that of their eukaryotic hosts. Soon after these discoveries, other virus families were found to deviate substantially from this &#x02018;conventional&#x02019; pathway (see below).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><italic>The RNA cap structure:</italic> the cap consists of a 7-methylguanosine (blue box) linked to the 5&#x02032; nucleoside of the messenger RNA chain through a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; triphosphate bridge (pink box). The methyl group of the guanosine at its N-7 position is surrounded in green, and the 2&#x02032;-O methyl group of the first and second nucleotide residue forming the cap-1 and the cap2 structures, respectively, are surrounded in light orange.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p><p id="p0010">In the conventional pathway, a cap structure is added to the nascent 5&#x02032;-triphosphate mRNA in a series of reactions (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
). The 5&#x02032;-triphosphate is first hydrolysed by an RNA 5&#x02032;-triphosphatase (RTPase). A guanylyltransferase (GTase), also called &#x0201c;capping enzyme&#x0201d;, adds the cap structure under the form of a guanosine 5&#x02032;-monophosphate in a 5&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; orientation. The cap is then methylated onto the N-7 position of its guanine by an RNA cap guanine N-7-methyltransferase (N-7 MTase). This generates the minimal cap-0 (m7GpppN&#x02026;), found in metazoan and lower eukaryotes. In higher eukaryotes, further methylation by ribose 2&#x02032;-O-methyltransferases (2&#x02032;-O MTases) occurs at the 2&#x02032;-position of the riboses of the original transcript to yield mainly cap-1 (m7GpppNmN&#x02026;) but also cap-2 (m7GpppNmNmN&#x02026;) structures.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><italic>Canonical RNA capping mechanisms.</italic> The cap-0 structure is formed on nascent RNA chains by the sequential action of three enzymes. (1) The RNA triphosphatase (RTPase, pink) hydrolyses the &#x003b3; phosphate of the nascent RNA (pppN-RNA, where N denotes the first transcribed nucleotide) to yield a diphosphate RNA (ppN-RNA) and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>). (2) RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase, light blue) reacts with the &#x003b1; phosphate of GTP releasing pyrophosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) and forms a covalent enzyme&#x02013;guanylate intermediate (Gp-GTase). The GTase then transfers the GMP molecule (Gp) to the 5&#x02032; diphosphate RNA to create GpppN-RNA. (3) RNA (guanine-N-7)-methyltransferase (N-7 MTase, green), recruited by the GTase, transfers the methyl group from <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine (AdoMet) to the cap guanine to form the cap-0 structure (<sup>m7</sup>GpppN) and releases <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-homocysteine (AdoHcy) as a by-product. The capping reaction is then completed by the methylation of the ribose-2&#x02032;-O position of the first nucleotide by the AdoMet-dependant (nucleoside-2&#x02032;-O)-methyltransferase (2&#x02032;-O MTase, orange), generating cap-1 structure (<sup>m7</sup>GpppN<sub>m2&#x02032;O</sub>). Below the schematic are listed examples of viruses that acquire their cap structures using the cellular capping machinery (first four examples) or encode their own viral capping machinery that adopt the canonic pathway. Question marks indicate viruses likely to follow this conventional pathway.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0015">The presence of the cap ensures stability of the transcript against a variety of cellular 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonucleases and recognition of the mRNA by the ribosomal protein eIF4E for efficient translation. The capping was also shown to be involved in other cellular processes such as RNA splicing and export (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Darnell, 1979</xref>, <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Filipowicz et al., 1976</xref>, <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">Schibler and Perry, 1977</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Because of its coupling to RNA transcription, RNA capping is mainly a nuclear process, although some RNA re-capping events are suspected to occur in the cytoplasm (reviewed in <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">Schoenberg and Maquat (2009)</xref>). Viruses generally replicate in the cytoplasm, causing there to be a time-window during which viral RNAs are synthesized but not yet capped. Virus and cell co-evolution has generated a number of cellular pathways and proteins involved in sensing the presence of viral RNAs. The absence of RNA cap as well as the presence of double stranded RNA are strong tokens for a viral infection. These RNA species, alone or together, are detected as &#x0201c;non-self&#x0201d; RNA by cellular sensors triggering an innate cellular immunity response (<xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Koyama et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr">Takeuchi and Akira, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">Wilkins and Gale, 2010</xref>). Viruses have evolved numerous strategies to escape detection, including rapid and efficient viral RNA capping.</p><p id="p0025">Few virus families and genera do not rely on RNA capping. <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> use a protein as an RNA synthesis primer and this protein replaces the RNA cap in its role for transcription promotion and RNA protection. Viruses from <italic>Pestivirus</italic> and <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> genera use unprotected 5&#x02032;-triphosphate RNA ends and other strategies to defend their RNA from the cell immunity systems (<xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Garaigorta and Chisari, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Guidotti and Chisari, 2001</xref>, <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Malmgaard, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">However, the vast majority of viruses use RNA capping. With the ongoing deciphering of viral RNA capping machineries, a true diversity of mechanisms, partners, and pathway organizations which invariably leads to the same RNA structure are progressively being uncovered. This diversity and its differences from the cellular RNA capping machineries are drawing a lot of attention for antiviral drug design.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Is RNA capping an appropriate target for antiviral research?</title><p id="p0035">There are factors to bear in mind before considering RNA capping as an interesting drug design target:</p><p id="p0040">
<italic>Specificity:</italic> a most often put forward requirement is the uniqueness of the viral target, i.e., the non-existence of a similar cellular target that could also be hit by any antiviral drug and cause serious side-effects. Interestingly, even when viral enzymes remain close in structure and mechanism to their cellular counterpart, there remain structural and functional differences potentially useful to achieve differential inhibition, i.e., selectivity for the viral target. In most cases, viral enzymes are profoundly original in folding, organization, and mechanisms, providing a large chemical space for drug design and drug selectivity.</p><p id="p0045">
<italic>Potency:</italic> another important parameter is the expected outcome of viral target inhibition. The question of whether the <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition effectively leads to a significant block of viral growth must be answered. One has to consider the two major mechanisms of action of the viral target. It can be an enzyme, and inhibition of its enzyme activity may have exponential consequences. On the other hand, the virus may develop alternative pathways in order to resist antiviral molecules. For example, <italic>Flavivirus</italic> capping inhibitors had to be validated since dengue virus was also shown to perform cap-independent translation of its RNA genome (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Edgil et al., 2006</xref>). Another possibility is that the target protein can be a binding partner devoid of catalytic activity and part of a protein&#x02013;protein binding equilibrium. Its inhibition would shift the equilibrium according to the law of mass action. The protein dosage must be fine tuned to exert a powerful antiviral effect. In both cases, a significant effect on viral growth must be observed to validate the target as appropriate.</p><p id="p0050">
<italic>Amplifying mechanism:</italic> lastly, one has to consider the number of events that the protein or target is involved in during the virus life-cycle. For example, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) incorporate several thousand nucleotides to produce a single RNA genome. Inhibition of the viral RdRp at each nucleotide incorporation should exhibit a powerful antiviral effect. In contrast, RNA capping events can vary from a single capping event (e.g., the genome of ss(+)RNA viruses), to many RNA capping events (e.g., <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, etc.). Nevertheless, the connection between RNA capping and antiviral innate immunity pathways is expected to amplify any drug action on RNA capping. Immature or incomplete RNA caps may not only exhibit an altered expression profile, but may also be detected by a variety of innate immunity sensors that add another direct negative effect on viral growth. In this context, it is noteworthy that the efficacy of RNA capping inhibition has been demonstrated. The inhibition of <italic>Flavivirus</italic> MTase, which catalyzes two methylations per synthesis of an entire RNA genome, has been reported to be able to completely suppress viral replication (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2008a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>3</label><title>Conventional and unconventional viral RNA capping mechanisms</title><p id="p0055">Alongside the discovery of conventional cellular and viral RNA capping (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), few viruses provided remarkable exceptions to the seemingly ubiquitous presence of capped mRNAs in Eukarya (as mentioned above for picorna-<italic>,</italic> hepaci- and pestiviruses). It was soon discovered that other viruses also used &#x02018;unconventional&#x02019; RNA capping reactions deviating from the conventional RNA capping scheme (example in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>
and for complete review (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Decroly et al., 2012</xref>)). Nevertheless, it is truly remarkable that several of these widely different RNA capping reactions and pathways converge to the same RNA cap structure (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>
). This observation indicates that the evolutionary pressure to keep this structure protecting RNA must be significant. Viral RNA capping is thus an interesting target for drug design. In the following sections we summarize our current knowledge on viral enzymes involved in conventional and unconventional RNA capping (main reference structures in <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>
) and reported inhibitors (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>

The hydrolysis of the &#x003b2;&#x02013;&#x003b3; phosphate bond at the 5&#x02032; end is mediated by the nsp2 RTPase domain (<xref rid="b0480" ref-type="bibr">Vasiljeva et al., 2000</xref>).

Interestingly, Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus were reported more than 30&#x000a0;year ago to contain additional methyl groups attached to the exocyclic N2 of the cap structure (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">HsuChen and Dubin, 1976</xref>, <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">van Duijn et al., 1986</xref>). The role of this methylation in virus replication is still unknown, but it is reminiscent to 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap that is found on non-coding eukaryal RNAs such as small nuclear (sn), small nucleolar (sno) RNAs, and telomerase RNA (<xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Busch et al., 1982</xref>, <xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">Seto et al., 1999</xref>).</p><sec id="s0095"><label>5.2.1</label><title>Inhibitors</title><p id="p0180">Ribavirin shows broad spectrum <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activity against RNA viruses, through presumably different modes of action (<xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">Leyssen et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">Severson et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>).

Instead of making its own RNA cap, the virus has a machinery to remove and transfer (snatch) the cap from host mRNA onto its own pre-mRNA (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Three major human pathogen families, <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>, <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> and <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), all of them ss(&#x02212;)RNA viruses, have developed this strategy (<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Bouloy et al., 1978</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Caton and Robertson, 1980</xref>, <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">Plotch et al., 1979</xref>). The <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> serves as a paradigm for both mechanistic and structural studies. In the case of the influenza virus, the replication complex is made of three proteins forming the polymerase complex (PA, PB1, PB2). Host cell mRNAs present in the cytoplasm are targeted and recruited by PB2 that presents the cap from the mRNA to the endonuclease domain (PA) to snip the cap off. Then the short capped RNA is used as primer to polymerize the viral RNA. The first structural endonuclease domain potentially involved in cap snatching was recently identified in both <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>, and <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> L protein (<xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">Morin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">Reguera et al., 2010</xref>) (ENDOase, <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The endonuclease fold features four mixed &#x003b2;-strands forming a twisted sheet surrounded by seven &#x003b1;-helices (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The &#x003b2; sheet forms the bottom of a negatively charged cavity creating a binding site for divalent cations. Above it, a C-terminal helix with a positive patch creates another pocket to accommodate the RNA where the typical conserved PD...(D/E)XK nuclease motif defines the catalytic site.</p><p id="p0195">A fourth example of cap snatching has recently been described in <italic>Totiviridae</italic> for a fungal virus (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Fujimura and Esteban, 2011</xref>). However, in this case the Totivirus L-A transfers only m7GMP snatched from cellular mRNA. Hence, this mechanism lies somewhere between alphaviruses, which transfer m7GMP acquired from GTP, and &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; cap-snatching viruses described above, which transfer longer capped RNA oligonucleotides. As an additional similarity to alphaviruses, the Totivirus L-A cap-snatching enzyme makes a covalent m7GMP-enzyme intermediate through a histidine residue (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Fujimura and Esteban, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Ahola et al., 1997</xref>).</p><sec id="s0110"><label>6.1.1</label><title>Inhibitors</title><p id="p0200">Ribavirin again is an effective inhibitor of <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> (<xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">Olschlager et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> (<xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Livonesi et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">Severson et al., 2003</xref>), but it has ple&#x000ef;otropic effects as discussed above and thus there is no direct evidence that the RNA cap snatching process is an actual target.</p><p id="p0205">The first discovery of inhibitors of the cap snatching pathway was made in 1994, when Tomassini et al. reported that 2,4-dioxobutanoic acid compounds were able to inhibit Influenza A and B viruses in infected cell cultures (<xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">Tomassini et al., 1994</xref>). Remarkably, the compounds exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values in the micromolar range, comparable to IC<sub>50</sub> values observed when purified polymerase cores were used in an <italic>in vitro</italic> endonuclease assay. The following chemical diversification of the parent compound could achieve a high specificity for influenza. Indeed, the L-735,882 compound reached an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M for influenza in an <italic>in vitro</italic> endonuclease assay and an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M in a viral titer assay using influenza virus infected cells. The La Crosse virus, a <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> for which RNA capping and RNA polymerase priming rely also on cap snatching, remained unaffected both at the enzyme and virus level. Interestingly, the La Crosse virus replicates in the cytoplasm exclusively, unlike the influenza virus. Therefore, RNA caps are likely snatched in different cellular compartments or environments by these two viruses and this should be considerated at early steps of drug design for large spectrum inhibitors.</p><p id="p0210">In 2009 and 2010, a structural basis for the inhibition mechanisms was provided by the crystal structure of the La Crosse virus endonuclease domains in complex with DPBA (<xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">Reguera et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, ENDOase inhibitor I)). The structural homology between the three available crystal structures indicates that a common pharmacophore including Mn<sup>2+</sup> chelating functional groups might be active against all three viral families. Based on these crystal structures, several compound families have been described and their antiviral activities characterized using enzyme-based assays, viral growth assays and protein structure data. The first compounds benefiting from structure-based activity analysis are catechins isolated from green tea. Although they seem to target both neuraminidase (<xref rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2005</xref>) and endonuclease, one active pharmacophore was identified as 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl. The same group extended the family of interesting compounds with thalidomide derivatives, active through their 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl moieties, and later with marchantin-like phytochemicals produced in very high yield in liverworts (<xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Iwai et al., 2011</xref>). Together with enzyme and virus-infected cell assays, docking the latter compounds into the PA endonuclease active site gave very interesting perspectives for effective drugs targeting influenza RNA capping.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s0115"><label>7</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0215">The viral RNA capping machinery is remarkably diverse in organization, structure, and mechanisms used by its enzymes. All RNA viruses capping their own viral RNAs have evolved enzymes profoundly different from those of their host cell. As the power of antiviral compound screening and design increases, there are no doubts that viral RNA capping enzymes will be the target of novel highly efficient and selective drugs. Despite few exceptions, the identification and atomic resolution structure of target enzymes from major families has made significant progress in the last ten years. The recent connection of viral RNA capping to the host cell innate immunity mechanisms is more than ever a promising antiviral research field.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhodes</surname><given-names>D.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>A.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The 5&#x02032; terminal structure of the methylated mRNA synthesized in vitro by vesicular stomatitis virus</article-title><source>Cell</source><volume>5</volume><year>1975</year><fpage>51</fpage><lpage>58</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">165900</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhodes</surname><given-names>D.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>A.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Novel initiation of RNA synthesis in vitro by vesicular stomatitis virus</article-title><source>Nature</source><volume>255</volume><year>1975</year><fpage>37</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">165428</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0015"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahola</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahlquist</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Putative RNA capping activities encoded by brome mosaic virus: methylation and covalent binding of guanylate by replicase protein 1a</article-title><source>J.
