Experimentally infected cats have measurable immune suppression, which sometimes progresses to an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A transient initial state of infection is followed by a long latent stage with low virus replication and absence of clinical signs. In the terminal stage, both viruses can cause severe immunosuppression. Thus, FIV infection in cats has become an important natural model for studying HIV infection in humans, especially for evaluation of antiviral compounds. Of particular importance for chemotherapeutic studies is the close similarity between the reverse transcriptase (RT) of FIV and HIV, which results in high <italic>in vitro</italic> susceptibility of FIV to many RT-targeted antiviral compounds used in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date review of studies on antiviral treatment of FIV, focusing on commercially available compounds for human or animal use.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>FIV</kwd><kwd>antiviral compounds</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-vetsci-02-00456"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>FIV can induce immunosuppression, which predisposes cats to secondary infections, stomatitis, neuropathies, and tumors. FIV does not directly cause severe clinical disease in most infected cats. Thus, FIV-infected cats can live with a good quality of life for many years with preventive health measures, and overall survival time of infected cats is not necessarily shorter than in uninfected cats [<xref rid="B1-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The most important strategy for managing FIV-infected cats is treatment of secondary infections. In cats with recurrent infections despite aggressive management, additional treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g., plerixafor and/or zidovudine) can be considered. Cats with no identifiable secondary diseases or with secondary disease that has been treated successfully might still suffer from problems likely associated with FIV, such as neurologic abnormalities or stomatitis; in these cases, antiviral treatment (e.g., with zidovudine) is also an option.</p><p>Antiviral compounds interfere with certain steps in the viral replication cycle. Based upon steps targeted, the drugs can be assigned to different drug classes [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This review covers the most common drugs used for treatment of FIV infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="vetsci-02-00456-t001">Table A1</xref>): reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs), which inhibit the retroviral enzyme reverse transcriptase (RTIs); drugs that inhibit other viral enzymes, such as DNA or RNA polymerases, thereby interfering with virus genome replication or with proteinases necessary for splitting precursor proteins during viral assembly (nucleotide synthesis inhibitors); drugs that target viral entry by binding to specific receptors that the virus uses for adsorption to the target cell, by acting as fusion inhibitors preventing conformational changes of the virus necessary for the fusion process, or by interfering with viral uncoating (receptor homologues/antagonists) [<xref rid="B4-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; drugs that inhibit integration by inhibiting the retroviral enzyme integrase (integrase inhibitors); drugs that inhibit viral replication by inhibiting the retroviral enzyme protease (protease inhibitors); and interferons.</p><sec><title>Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</title><p>The most commonly used antiretroviral drugs in human and veterinary medicine are RTIs. There are three categories of RTIs: nucleoside analogue RTIs (NARTIs, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1-vetsci-02-00456">Section 1</xref>), nucleotide analogue RTIs, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-vetsci-02-00456">Section 2</xref>, and non-nucleoside RTIs (NNRTIs, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-vetsci-02-00456">Section 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A nucleoside consists of a nitrogenous base covalently attached to a sugar (ribose in RNA, 2-deoxyribose in DNA), and a nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and a phosphate group. Nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) contains a chain of nucleotides covalently linked to form a sugar-phosphate backbone with protruding nitrogenous bases. Prior to linkage of a new nucleotide (or monophosphate) to the nucleic acid, three phosphate groups must be bound to the nucleoside (triphosphate), two of which are removed, releasing energy during elongation of the nucleic acid chain [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-vetsci-02-00456"><title>2. Nucleoside Analogue Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</title><p>NARTIs are the most widely used antiviral compounds in both human and veterinary medicine. NARTIs are molecules that are similar to the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; nucleosides and require intracellular phosphorylation for activation. Due to their structural similarities, they can bind to the active center of enzymes (e.g., RT, other polymerases) and block enzyme activity. Many of these analogues are also integrated into growing DNA or RNA strands, but because of small differences in the molecular structure, chain termination results or nonfunctional nucleic acids are produced [<xref rid="B5-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

The first <italic>in vitro</italic> study was carried out in 1989, when North and coworkers showed that zidovudine inhibited FIV replication in Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells. The susceptibility of FIV to zidovudine was similar to that of HIV [<xref rid="B27-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There is evidence that FIV can become resistant to nucleoside analogues, as is the case in HIV. Zidovudine-resistant FIV mutants can arise after only six months of use, and a single-point mutation in the FIV gene is responsible for resistance [<xref rid="B10-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, zidovudine can reduce plasma viral load, improve the immunologic and clinical status of FIV-infected cats, increase quality of life, and prolong life expectancy [<xref rid="B16-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In placebo-controlled trials, zidovudine improved stomatitis and increased the CD4/CD8 ratio in naturally FIV-infected cats.

Regular blood cell counts are necessary during zidovudine treatment because non-regenerative anemia is a common side effect [<xref rid="B28-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Cats with bone marrow suppression should not be treated with zidovudine. Most FIV-infected cats treated with zidovudine for as long as two years tolerated the drug well. The hematocrit can decline within three weeks of initiating treatment to approximately 50% of baseline but increases afterwards in most cases, even without discontinuation of treatment. If the hematocrit drops below 20%, discontinuation of treatment is recommended, and anemia usually resolves within a few days.

In addition, there was no significant difference between the SC historical control group and the PO group, suggesting that oral administration of rFeIFN-&#x003c9; might be a viable and less expensive alternative [<xref rid="B109-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In a recently published study that assessed viremia, provirus load, and blood cytokine profile in naturally FIV-infected cats treated with oral rFeIFN-&#x003c9; (10<sup>5</sup> U/cat PO q 24 h for 90 days) or with subcutaneous rFeIFN-&#x003c9; (10<sup>6</sup> U/cat SC q 24 h for 5 consecutive days in three courses), no change in the level of viremia or in most cytokine levels was found; a placebo control group was not included [<xref rid="B109-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The fact that virus load remained unchanged but some clinical improvement was observed in earlier studies suggests that rFeIFN-&#x003c9; has an effect on secondary infections rather than on FIV itself [<xref rid="B94-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. As there are major differences in outcomes of the different studies on feline IFN-&#x003c9; in FIV-infected cats. Thus, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn without additional randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded studies that include a sufficiently high number of naturally FIV-infected cats.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec10-vetsci-02-00456"><title>10. Conclusions</title><p>Unfortunately, the efficacy of antiviral compounds for the treatment of FIV in cats has been generally poor. The duration of treatment in many clinical trials was relatively short and might have been inadequate for infections with a long clinical course. In addition, it is difficult to compare treatment results of cats infected experimentally and kept under laboratory conditions and pet cats infected with field strains of FIV. Therefore, further well-designed double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials using antiviral drugs in naturally FIV-infected cats are needed to determine the efficacy and side effects of different antiviral compounds.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors did not receive a grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or non-profit-sectors for the preparation of this review article.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Katrin Hartmann had the original idea for the review and draftet the manuscript together with Mich&#x000e8;le Bergmann and Anita Wooding.
