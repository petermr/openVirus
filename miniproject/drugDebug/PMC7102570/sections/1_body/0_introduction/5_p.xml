 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Ku &amp; Chan, 1999</xref>), concern regarding novel influenza pandemics, such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), has been noted because no one is immune to these viruses. Novel influenza strains cause more severe diseases, particularly pneumonia, than seasonal influenza, and the mortality rate is 53.5% (483/903) for influenza A(H5N1) (
