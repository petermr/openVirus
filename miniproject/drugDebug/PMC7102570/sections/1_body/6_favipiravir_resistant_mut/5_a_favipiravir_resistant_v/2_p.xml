<p id="p0320">Antiviral susceptibility was examined in 57 pairs of influenza viruses isolated from patients before and after the administration of favipiravir in phase 3 clinical trials. No viruses displayed reduced susceptibility to favipiravir, although two of 20 paired A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates, one of 17 paired A(H3N2) isolates and one of 20 paired B viruses possessed amino acid substitutions in the RdRp subunits PB1, PB2 and PA after favipiravir administration (
 <xref rid="bb0565" ref-type="bibr">Takashita et al., 2016</xref>). These amino acid substitutions in the RdRp had nothing to do with the susceptibility of favipiravir and seemed to have occurred regardless of favipiravir treatment. This trial was a limited clinical study to assess the emergence of favipiravir-resistant virus, but the appearance of oseltamivir or baloxavir resistance might be observed in clinical trials of influenza treatment with oseltamivir and baloxavir with a similar number of patients, as described in Section 4.3. The lack of the emergence and replacement of resistant viruses during favipiravir treatment in vitro and in humans indicates that the same effectiveness of favipiravir is expected to be maintained from the beginning to the end of the influenza pandemic and that all patients could be treated effectively.
