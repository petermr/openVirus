<p id="p0310">A common feature of less susceptible viruses is high fidelity of RdRp that may distinguish favipiravir-RTP and GTP and replicate in the presence of favipiravir by avoiding the incorporation of favipiravir-RTP. Since their proliferative ability is not high, clones that are less susceptible to favipiravir grow well alone or are not viable, but an additional alteration that modulates RdRp activity restores the replication capability and the susceptibility to favipiravir (

Favipiravir-resistant mutants of influenza virus have been created by reverse-engineering and replicate as a clone with a reduced growth property. Therefore, this virus is unlikely to replace the entire growing virus population when it is produced during favipiravir treatment, as has been observed in many laboratories.
