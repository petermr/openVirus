<p id="p0290">We tried to isolate favipiravir-resistant influenza virus and poliovirus from 28 and 10 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks, respectively, after independent cultures in the presence of increasing concentrations of favipiravir for a month, but no resistant virus was isolated (

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Daikoku et al., 2017</xref>). Then, we decided to deny the possibility of replacement with the resistant virus. Spontaneous mutation rates of the influenza virus RdRp complex and poliovirus 3D RdRp are both approximately 1 × 10

 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Gubareva &amp; Fry, 2019</xref>). Titers of influenza virus and poliovirus in the culture reach approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> infectious viral particles/mL in 5 mL of media in a 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask, and their genomes contain approximately 13,600 and 7500 base pairs, respectively, stochastically indicating 10
 <sup>4</sup> alterations per nucleotide in the genome. Therefore, every type of mutant should be generated during replication, and continuous cultivation for a month might increase the favipiravir-resistant virus population. If favipiravir induces mutations more frequently than natural processes, mutants resistant to favipiravir should be isolated easily, and the culture should be replaced by the favipiravir-resistant mutants. We isolated susceptibility variants of influenza virus and poliovirus in the cultures treated with favipiravir for a month and identified nucleotide substitutions (mutations) in their RdRp genes, but these mutations were not related to resistance or mutations common to favipiravir (

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Daikoku et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, theoretical resistant mutants should be generated but are unable to replicate or replicate with reduced fidelity to replace the entire virus population. The favipiravir-resistant mutant replicates as an artificially generated clone but does not become dominant among the entire virus population that grows in the presence of favipiravir (

 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Delang et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Goldhill et al., 2019</xref>). Our results are consistent with the absence of a resistant virus in the entire virus population treated with favipiravir.
