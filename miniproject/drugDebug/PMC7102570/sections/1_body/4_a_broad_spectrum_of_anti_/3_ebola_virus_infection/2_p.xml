<p id="p0195">Concerning Ebola virus infection, the efficacy of favipiravir in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was shown in a mouse model (
 <xref rid="bb0550" ref-type="bibr">Smither et al., 2014</xref>) and a therapeutic mouse model of Ebola virus disease (
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Oestereich, Ludtke, et al., 2014</xref>). Treatment with favipiravir from 6 to 13 days after lethal infection with Ebola virus cured all mice when the treatment was started at the initiation of liver damage (elevation of AST and ALT) and virus detection in blood. However, the administration of favipiravir from 8 to 14 days prolonged survival, but four of five mice died when the liver damage and viremia advanced. Early treatment with favipiravir was effective, but when the disease is advanced, including liver damage, the efficacy in prolonging survival is limited to one of five mice, indicating that treatment should be started before liver damage progresses to irreversible levels. Thus, favipiravir may be able to cure an Ebola virus infection in the early phase of infection, but the curative activity of favipiravir may be limited in patients with an advanced infection.
