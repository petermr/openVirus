<p id="p0205">An Ebola study conducted in Guinea included 126 patients, and 111 were analyzed and compared with 540 patients as a historical control group. Favipiravir treatment reduced the mortality rate in the low viral load group to 33% compared with the historical control group that was not treated with favipiravir, but this reduction in the mortality rate was not statistically significant (

The overall survival rate in the favipiravir treatment group was higher than the control group (56.4% [22/39] vs 35.3% [30/85];

During the 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus infection in West Africa, patients who were treated without favipiravir in the period before preparation for favipiravir treatment were classified as historical controls, and the therapeutic efficacy of favipiravir was compared between the patient group treated with favipiravir and the historical patient group in the two clinical trials described above. Randomized placebo-controlled trials are desirable for confirming therapeutic effects in clinical trials, but the placebo group has an ethical problem of not being able to receive an effective drug that can recover fatal infections in animal models. The studies were conducted to compare the effectiveness of favipiravir treatment between patients who were not treated in the period prior to the start of drug administration as the historical control patient group and those who were treated with favipiravir after the clinical study was ready.
