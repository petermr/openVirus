<p id="p0115">Favipiravir inhibits viral RNA synthesis as a chain terminator. This inhibition of genomic RNA synthesis is the most important difference from other anti-influenza drugs, which substantially forms the pool of genomic RNA containing drug-resistant mutants synthesized by viral RdRp with low fidelity from the RdRp-viral RNA complex. The anti-influenza drugs NAIs and baloxavir inhibit the spread of infection but allow the synthesis of genomic RNA, and the genomic RNA pool is important from the perspective of the generation of resistant viruses as a source of drug-resistant viruses.</p>
