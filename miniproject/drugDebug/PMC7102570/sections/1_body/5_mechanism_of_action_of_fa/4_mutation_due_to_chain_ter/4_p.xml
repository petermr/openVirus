<p id="p0255">If favipiravir induces mismatches as a mutagen, favipiravir should allow elongation after its incorporation into the elongating RNA strand and induce mismatches at the favipiravir-incorporated sites in the new complementary strand. This possibility is inconsistent with the mechanism of favipiravir as a chain terminator. Thus, the increased mutation rates observed in response to favipiravir treatment are unlikely to be due to the incorporation of favipiravir into viral RNA followed by elongation, similar to ribavirin or acyclovir (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Favipiravir is unlikely to induce mismatches upon its incorporation into the RNA strand and transitions in the influenza virus genome. The increased rate of transition mutations observed after favipiravir treatment is presumed to be due to the biased nucleotide pool induced by the increase in the level of favipiravir-RTP and the properties of viral RdRp.
