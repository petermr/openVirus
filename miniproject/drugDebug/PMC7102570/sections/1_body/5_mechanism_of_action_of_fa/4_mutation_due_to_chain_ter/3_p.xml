<p id="p0250">Acyclovir causes chain termination at the incorporated site during the elongation of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus DNA and prevents viral DNA synthesis. However, the incorporated acyclovir is removed by the proofreading activity of viral DNA polymerase, and viral DNA elongation continues. Therefore, the sequence containing the guanosine homopolymeric string (G-string) in the genome is the target of the incorporation and removal of acyclovir, and the incorporation of guanosine followed by repeated corrections by the proofreading machinery create a hot spot of mutations in G-strings of our laboratory and clinical acyclovir-resistant isolates (

 <xref rid="bb0575" ref-type="bibr">Talarico, Phelps, &amp; Biron, 1993</xref>). Penciclovir (famciclovir) and ganciclovir (valganciclovir), which are guanosine analogues, function as an anti-herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus agent and anti-cytomegalovirus agent, respectively, with mechanisms similar to acyclovir, but they do not induce mutations or have hot spots in the G-string. These compounds do not prevent elongation at the incorporation site but are incorporated, and elongation pauses at normal nucleotides after the incorporated site. Therefore, mutations associated with proofreading do not occur in the G-string, and this difference in the mode of chain termination and proofreading activity causes a lower mutation frequency in subjects treated with penciclovir and ganciclovir than in subjects treated with acyclovir.
