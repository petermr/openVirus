<p id="p0260">A biased nucleotide pool is a major factor that promotes polymerase-induced mutation synthesis (
 <xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler, Rajagopal, &amp; Mathews, 2005</xref>). Influenza RdRp complex is composed of PB1, PB2, and PA and requires four nucleotides, ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, as substrates for RNA synthesis. Influenza RdRp incorporates mismatched nucleotides in a primer-extension-based misincorporation assay in the presence of completely biased nucleotide pools consisting of only three nucleotides instead of all four nucleotides (
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Aggarwal, Bradel-Tretheway, Takimoto, Dewhurst, &amp; Kim, 2010</xref>). Even if one of the four nucleotides is missing, its absence is compensated by other nucleotides, and the RNA strand continues to elongate, causing mismatches. Therefore, even in the absence of a mutagen, mismatches should occur during RNA synthesis under biased nucleotide pool conditions as if the mutagen is present.
