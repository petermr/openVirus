<p id="p0240">Favipiravir-4-ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate (RTP) has a higher affinity for the RdRp of influenza virus than GTP and functions as a chain terminator (
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0495" ref-type="bibr">Sangawa et al., 2013</xref>). Favipiravir-RTP and ribavirin TP inhibit the RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>s) of 0.14 and 2.4 μM, respectively (
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2005</xref>). The RdRp activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of labeled GTP in the elongating RNA strand. Favipiravir-RTP has a higher affinity for RdRp than GTP, and when incorporated, favipiravir-RTP stops the elongation of the RNA strand in which it is incorporated. This termination prevents the incorporation of radioactivity, and thus favipiravir-RTP exhibits high inhibitory activity and a low IC
 <sub>50</sub> (0.14 μM). On the other hand, ribavirin induces competitive inhibition with GTP, and incorporation results in mismatch mutations; the strand continues to elongate and incorporate labeled GTP without stopping at the incorporation site. Thus, ribavirin has a high IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (2.4 μM) because its RNA strand is further elongated by incorporating radiolabeled GTP. Therefore, its ability to inhibit enzyme activity becomes weaker, and it displays a higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> value than favipiravir. Furthermore, a marked decrease in the amount of the viral genome has been observed in favipiravir-treated cultures compared with ribavirin-treated cultures (
 <xref rid="bb0600" ref-type="bibr">Vanderlinden et al., 2016</xref>). Favipiravir is incorporated into the viral genome and terminates elongation, resulting in shorter genome sizes and the marked loss of the viral genome in favipiravir-treated cultures (
 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">Rocha-Pereira et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0600" ref-type="bibr">Vanderlinden et al., 2016</xref>). These observations are consistently explained by the chain termination induced by favipiravir.
