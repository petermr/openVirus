<p id="p0225">Favipiravir inhibits viral RdRp by terminating elongation at the incorporation site as a chain terminator (
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Jin, Smith, Rajwanshi, Kim, &amp; Deval, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0495" ref-type="bibr">Sangawa et al., 2013</xref>). Favipiravir functions as a purine analogue, as expected from the chemical structure, and it is incorporated instead of guanosine and adenosine. Favipiravir terminates elongation after the incorporation of a single favipiravir molecule (
 <xref rid="bb0495" ref-type="bibr">Sangawa et al., 2013</xref>) and after the incorporation of two consecutive favipiravir molecules (
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2013</xref>), and the synthesis of this complementary viral RNA strand cannot be completed. In contrast, the anti-RNA virus drug ribavirin is incorporated into the replicating strand, which further elongates and accumulates mismatched nucleotides at the incorporated sites. Base pairing with ribavirin in the complementary strand during replication, transcription, and translation of the RNA strand causes mismatched base pairing, the production of nonfunctional proteins, and a loss of viral infectivity. Accumulated mutations (mismatched nucleotides) cause the replicated viruses to lose their replicative capability, which is known as “lethal mutagenesis” (
 <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">Vignuzzi, Stone, &amp; Andino, 2005</xref>), as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> . When the number of mutations is limited and infectious viruses with mutations in viral RdRp that affect ribavirin incorporation are produced, drug-resistant viruses can be selected in the presence of ribavirin.
