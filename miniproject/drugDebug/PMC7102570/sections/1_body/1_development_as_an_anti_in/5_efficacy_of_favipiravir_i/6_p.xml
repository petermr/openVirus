Influenza infection induces TNF-α production in mouse macrophage-derived P388D1 cells, and the suppressive effects of favipiravir and oseltamivir were compared in this P388D1 cell-based system. Favipiravir significantly suppresses the production of TNF-α in influenza virus-infected P388D1 cells compared with the active form of oseltamivir (
 <xref rid="bb0580" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2017</xref>). TNF-α appears first and disappears first in P338D1 cells among TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 (
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Kurokawa et al., 2003</xref>), and we observed a significant reduction in the levels of TNF-α in P388D1 cells and influenza-infected mice treated with favipiravir. The antiviral activity of favipiravir has been attributed to a decrease in the pulmonary viral load and TNF-α level in the airways of influenza virus-infected mice compared with oseltamivir, and the reduction in the viral RNA load induced by favipiravir might have resulted in a reduction in TNF-α production and alleviation of lung pathogenesis (

 <xref rid="bb0580" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these findings, the intracellular viral RNA is less recognized by intracellular Toll-like receptors and results in a decrease in the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. This mechanism may also contribute to the enhanced effects of favipiravir treatment on alleviating influenza infection compared with oseltamivir treatment.
