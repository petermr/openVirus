 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows one of the comparisons of efficacy between favipiravir and oseltamivir in the influenza virus infection model established with a high titer of virus in a series of experiments, and the better efficacy of favipiravir compared with oseltamivir was observed in an animal with a severe lethal influenza infection with a high viral load (
 <xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>). Favipiravir and oseltamivir show similar efficacy in low-dose infections, but the efficacy of favipiravir as an influenza drug is clearly increased compared with oseltamivir in high-titer virus infections (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Mice in the control group die on day 3 after a high-dose infection, and an oseltamivir treatment prolongs the survival period for three days but does not prevent death. The favipiravir treatment cures lethal infection, and all mice survive. Favipiravir exhibits better efficacy than oseltamivir after a delayed administration beginning 1, 24, 48, or 72 h after infection with seasonal influenza A(H1N1) (
