<p id="p0035">Clinical trials of treatments for seasonal influenza have been performed in Japan and the US, and favipiravir was approved as a treatment for novel or re-emerging influenza viruses in Japan in 2014. However, favipiravir (Avigan®) is only considered for administration to patients when the government judges that this drug will be used as a countermeasure for novel or re-emerging influenza viruses. In addition, favipiravir is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because it exerts teratogenic and embryotoxic effects on animals. The Taiwanese CDC decided to stockpile favipiravir for people who became infected with new strains of influenza, including avian and swine influenzas, in 2015. The Japanese government decided to stockpile favipiravir (Avigan®) as a novel influenza countermeasure for 2 million people in 2017. Recent clinical trials have been performed to assess its efficacy in treating SFTS in Japan (
