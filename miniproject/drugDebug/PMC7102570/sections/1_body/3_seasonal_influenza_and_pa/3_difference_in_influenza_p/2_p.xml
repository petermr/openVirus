<p id="p0135">Seasonal influenza strains that are adapted to humans include A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B influenza and cause seasonal epidemics of influenza among humans every year. Seasonal influenza viruses mainly infect the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract because their hemagglutinins bind to their receptor, sialic acid linked to galactose by an alpha-2,6 linkage that is distributed in the upper respiratory tract. Although these strains cause epidemics every year, the susceptibility and severity of illness are modified by the degree of immunity of the host as described above.</p>
