<p id="p0175">Favipiravir is significantly more effective in treating mice with severe influenza infections characterized by a high viral load than oseltamivir (
 <xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>), and a favipiravir-resistant virus does not emerge during treatment. This outstanding feature of favipiravir as an anti-influenza drug has been exploited in treating patients with severe influenza in combination with oseltamivir in China (
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Cao, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Favipiravir and oseltamivir combination therapy accelerated clinical recovery compared to oseltamivir monotherapy in severe influenza. The dose of favipiravir used in the study mentioned above was 1600 mg twice a day on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice a day for 9 days, and the approved favipiravir dose in Japan is 1600 mg twice a day on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice a day for 4 days. The viral replication period is 6 days or longer for seasonal influenza (

 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Memoli et al., 2014</xref>). When drug administration is stopped during the virus replication period or when resistant strains appear, virus replication and fever relapse. Thus, 10 days of administration may be required for severe influenza or novel influenza.
