<p id="p0165">Oseltamivir- and baloxavir-resistant mutants emerge and become dominant viruses during their treatment, and the resistant viruses are transmitted to other hosts. Thus, these resistant viruses may become dominant pandemic viruses. In contrast, favipiravir treatment does not change the susceptibility of 57 pairs of viruses to favipiravir before and after treatment (
 <xref rid="bb0565" ref-type="bibr">Takashita et al., 2016</xref>). Although the number of cases is limited, 57 pairs might be sufficient to detect a virus resistant to the current anti-influenza drug, suggesting that favipiravir-resistant mutants will not appear. Favipiravir alone may maintain its efficacy from the beginning to the end of an influenza pandemic without replacement by resistant strains for which the effectiveness of drugs is reduced during treatment or during the pandemic.
