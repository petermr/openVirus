<p id="p0250">Two pairs of enantiomers, namely epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, were prepared from 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> by chiral separation. First, CPE inhibition assays were designed in three different ways to examine their inhibitory effect against influenza virus strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and to determine at which stage they act in the viral replication cycle. The results indicated that the antiviral activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin was mainly attributed to their virucidal effect, but not action on host cell protection or post-virus-adsorption interruption. Virus, rather than cell, was more probably to be the action target of the components. Hence, further insight into the antiviral activity 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> was performed by hemagglutination test on the allantoic fluid of embryonated eggs. In agreement with previous observations, the four components were all found to significantly reduce viral titer in chicken embryos when mixed with virus before infection. Taken together, it was concluded that epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin showed obvious virucidal effect on influenza virus A (H1N1) 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in ovo.</italic>
