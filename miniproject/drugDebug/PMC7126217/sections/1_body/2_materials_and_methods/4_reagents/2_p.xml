<p id="p0165">Peramivir (Guangzhou Nanxin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) was used as the reference compound. The reagents used in the study were as follows: sodium chloride injection (Shijiazhuang Siyao Co., Ltd.), phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Hyclone), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma), Alsever's solution (pH 6.1) an isotonic solution of 2.05% glucose, 0.8% trisodium citrate, 0.42% sodium chloride and 0.055% citric acid in double-distilled water. 0.6% suspension of Leghorn chicken red blood cells (CRBCs) was prepared with equal volume of chicken (male) blood and Alsever's solution (pH 6.1). Then the mixture was washed with PBS for 3 times. The supernatant was discarded and an appropriate amount of blood erythrocytes was diluted with PBS to prepare 0.6% erythrocyte suspension. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) was from Dojindo. Neuraminidase Inhibitors Screen Kit was from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology Co., Ltd., which contains 1 mL of neuraminidase, 10 mL of buffer, 1 mL of fluorescent substrate and 1.2 mL of water. Ammonium acetate, granular activated carbon, acetonitrile, glucose, sodium chloride, trisodium citrate and citric acid were from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Carbon dioxide was from Chengweifeng Inc. De-ionized water was purified by a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).</p>
