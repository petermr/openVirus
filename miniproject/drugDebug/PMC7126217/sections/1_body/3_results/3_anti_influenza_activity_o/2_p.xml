<p id="p0225">Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were evaluated for their antiviral activity against the influenza virus strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) on MDCK cells via cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay. The mode of action of the components was studied. When the cells were pre-treated with epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin before viral adsorption or the cells were treated with the components after virus incubation, no obvious protective effect was observed. However, when the cells were treated with pre-reacted virus and component, a pronounced CPE inhibition effect was detected. Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin exhibited dose-dependent anti-influenza virus activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.44 ± 0.03, 0.19 ± 0.01, 0.36 ± 0.02 and 0.19 ± 0.02 μM, respectively (
