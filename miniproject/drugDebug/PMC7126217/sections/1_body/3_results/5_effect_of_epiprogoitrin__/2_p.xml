<p id="p0235">The inhibitory effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on hemagglutinin was examined to characterize the mode of their antiviral action. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> , hemagglutinin was not inhibited in the reaction solution used as positive control, nor in the presence of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin or goitrin, even at the highest concentration (5 mg/mL) which exhibited antiviral activity.
