<p id="p0265">In conclusion, experimental results indicated that epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> derived glucosinolates isomers and their breakdown products, could neutralize the influenza virus strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), thus exhibiting anti-viral efficacy 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in ovo</italic>. The finding enriched the pharmacology and the mechanism for research and development of 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic>, the most common traditional medicine used for treating influenza. Further mechanistic studies implied that the above components had no inhibitory effect on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Thus, the attachment to the viral envelope without disturbing viral adsorption or budding to host cells was suggested to contribute critically to the mode of antiviral action of the components. Potential activity on other influenza virus targets like endonuclease, viral polymerase, nucleoprotein or M2 protein needs future exploration. With accurate anti-viral efficacy and low toxicity, epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin from 
 <italic>Isatidis Radix</italic> are expected to be used as promising antiviral drug resources. Consequently, further validation including 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation and clinical trials are required before introducing them from the research into practical application. However, whether the glucosinolates and their enzymatic hydrolysates could inhibit other influenza viruses or not is unknown and the molecular mechanism still needs to be clarified by further investigation.
