Previously, there has been a focus on &#x0201c;one drug, one virus&#x0201d; dogma, which relied on targeting virus-specific factors. A counterpoint to this is the &#x0201c;one drug, multiple viruses&#x0201d; paradigm, which came with the discovery of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs), small-molecules that inhibit a wide range of human viruses (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Bekerman and Einav, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">de Clercq and Montgomery, 1983</xref>, <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Debing et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Ianevski et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">Rada and Dragun, 1977</xref>, <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr">Sidwell et al., 1972</xref>). This paradigm was based on the observation that different viruses utilize similar pathways and host factors to replicate inside a cell (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Bosl et al., 2019</xref>). Although the concept of BSAAs has been around for almost 50 years, the field received a new impetus with recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, Dengue, influenza and other viral infections, the discovery of novel host-directed agents, as well as development of drug repositioning methodology.</p><p id="par0025">Drug repurposing, also called repositioning, redirecting, reprofiling, is a strategy for generating additional value from an existing drug by targeting disease other than that for which it was originally intended (<xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">Nishimura and Hara, 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">Pushpakom et al., 2019</xref>). This has significant advantages over new drug discovery since chemical synthesis steps, manufacturing processes, reliable safety, and pharmacokinetic properties in pre-clinical (animal model) and early clinical developmental phases (phase 0, I and IIa) are already available (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>
). Therefore, repositioning of launched or even failed drugs to viral diseases provides unique translational opportunities, including a substantially higher probability of success to market as compared with developing new virus-specific drugs and vaccines, and a significantly reduced cost and timeline to clinical availability (<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Ianevski et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">Pizzorno et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="bib0570" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>).<fig id="fig0005"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Discovery of novel activities and follow-up development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs).

Immortalized cancerous cell cultures and co-cultures, which express appropriate viral receptors, are most commonly used in this first step. The half-maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC<sub>50</sub>) for a compound are calculated based on their dose-response curves obtained on mock-infected cells. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) are calculated based on the analysis of curves obtained on infected cells. Statistical analyses can help to determine if the differences between CC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>50</sub> are significant, given the inherent variability of the experiment (<xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Meneghini and Hamasaki, 1967</xref>). A relative effectiveness of a drug is defined as selectivity index (SI&#x02009;=&#x02009;CC<sub>50</sub>/EC<sub>50</sub>).</p><p id="par0040">Cell viability assays and cell death assays are commonly used to assess the cytotoxicity and efficacy of BSAAs (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>

Cell viability assays include MTT, MTS, resazurin or similar assays, mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dyes-based assays, esterase cleaved dye-based assays, ATP-ADP assays, and assays that measure glycolytic flux and oxygen consumption. Other cell death assays include LDH enzyme leakage assays, membrane impermeable dye-based assays, and apoptosis assays, such as Annexin V, TUNEL, and caspase assays (<xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the Cell Titer Glo (CTG) assay quantifies ATP, an indicator of metabolically active living cells, whereas Cell Tox Green assay uses fluorescent asymmetric cyanine dye that stains the DNA of dead cells (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Bosl et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Bulanova et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Ianevski et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig0010"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>ABC of BSAA development process.

Thereby, novel antiviral activities of BSAAs should be further validated in primary human cells using different viral strains (including wild-type viruses), different viral loads, different times of compound addition, different endpoint measurements and compound concentration range. Primary cell cultures give more accurate images of drug responses (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Alves et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Denisova et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">Koban et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">Postnikova et al., 2018</xref>).

The cells are characterized by their high degrees of specialization, are often fully differentiated and thus require defined culture conditions (serum-free media) in order to preserve their original phenotype. Peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC), placental, amniotic and fetal primary cultures as well as vaginal/cervical epithelial and male germ cells have been used intensively to validate BSAA activity (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Barrows et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Denisova et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Fink et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">Rausch et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2018</xref>). Although primary cell cultures are relevant systems for validation of BSAAs, there are technical difficulties limiting their use, such as ethical issues, purity of population of primary cells, and limited shelf life of the cells.

PK/PD studies determine drug absorption, dosage and half-life of BSAAs. Toxicological studies determine if the drugs have any adverse effects on the tissues and organs of the animals and define the dosage of adverse effects (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Alabaster and In Vivo Pharmacology Training Group, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">Parasuraman, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr">Rizk et al., 2017</xref>). Studying the efficacy of BSAAs is generally done by treating the animal with the drug or vehicle and infecting it with a virus of interest. Endpoints are usually body weight/ mortality (depending on the virus), histopathology, virus titers in organs, presence of clinical signs and development of immunity (<xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">Oh and Hurt, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr">Smee and Barnard, 2013</xref>). Although animal models can give the initial characterization of BSAA, it is important to keep in mind that they differ significantly from humans, with respect to symptoms, disease manifestation, susceptibility, immune responses, pathogenesis, and pharmacokinetics (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Barr&#x000e9;-Sinoussi and Montagutelli, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr">Shanks et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="par0085">Often animals require higher concentration of an experimental antiviral as compared to effective in vitro concentrations. Moreover, it is relatively difficult to achieve micromolar EC50 in vivo. For example, aminoglycoside antibiotics, kasugamycin and neomycin were successfully tested against ZIKV, FLUAV, and HSV-2 infections in mice (<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Gopinath et al., 2018</xref>). Polyether antibiotic salinomycin also showed anti-FLUAV effect in mice (<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, investigational anticancer agent, flavopiridol, was effective against FLUAV in mice (<xref rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr">Soderholm et al., 2016</xref>).

However, safe-in-man BSAAs make this journey relatively short, because they have been already at phase 0, I and, sometime, at IIa of clinical trials as antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anticancer, etc. agent; i.e. they have been administered at sub-therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers to ensure the drugs are not harmful to the participants. Thus, safe-in-man BSAAs enter phase II and III, which assess the efficacy, effectiveness, safety and side effects of the drugs in clinic. It is important, however, to differentiate acute and chronic viral infections when repurposing BSAAs, given that drug concentrations and duration of the treatment could be different, and therefore, drug safety issues should be considered.</p><p id="par0095">For phase II, patients with the viral disease in question are invited to join the study, where they are administered the BSAAs at the ideal therapeutic doses. Phase III is the longest of the phases, and includes multiple levels of securities to the studies, such as the use of placebos and double-blinded studies, to ensure the data is as unbiased as possible. Upon completing phase III, depending on its performance and efficacy, BSAAs may end either being approved or dropped. The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that only 25&#x02013;30% BSAA candidates that enter phase III are approved for use in the public (<xref rid="bib0475" ref-type="bibr">U.S Food and Drug Administration, 2018</xref>).

Imatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and dasatinib, which inhibit tyrosine kinases, are the most abundant host-directed BSAAs. Most of the host targets (except Bcl-xL protein) are essential for viral replication but redundant for the cell, which is critical for reducing putative toxicities associated with blocking cellular pathways.
