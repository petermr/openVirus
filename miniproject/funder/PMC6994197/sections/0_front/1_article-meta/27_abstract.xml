 <p>In the absence of reliable surveillance data on the burden of hepatitis E in endemic countries, we conducted a hospital-based acute jaundice surveillance study over a two and a half year period in six tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. The study confirms that HEV infections occur throughout the year, and is a major (34%) cause of acute jaundice in tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Three-quarters of the acute hepatitis E cases were male, and HEV infection was higher among patients residing in urban areas than patients in rural areas (41% vs 32%). The overall case fatality rate of acute HEV infections in hospitals was 5%, but was higher among pregnant women (12%). Hepatitis E patients who died were more likely to have co-infection with HAV or HBV than the HEV infected patients who did not die. Fifteen percent of HEV infected mothers had miscarriage/stillbirth. Of the children who were born alive, 19% died, all within one week of birth. Considering the high burden of hepatitis E among hospitalized acute jaundice patients, Bangladesh could take control measures to reduce this risk including improvements in water quality, sanitation and hygiene practices and the introduction of hepatitis E vaccine in high-risk areas.</p>
