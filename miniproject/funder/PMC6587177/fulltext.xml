yet prior trial results are inconsistent. We report results from HPTN 071 (PopART), the
largest HIV prevention trial to date.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>In this community-randomized trial (2013-18), 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa
were randomized to Arm A (PopART intervention, universal antiretroviral therapy [ART]),
Arm B (PopART intervention, ART per local guidelines), and Arm C (standard-of-care). The
PopART intervention included home-based HIV-testing delivered by community workers who
supported linkage-to-care, ART adherence, and other services. The primary outcome, HIV
incidence between months 12-36, was measured in a Population Cohort (PC) of ~2,000
randomly-sampled adults/community aged 18-44y. Viral suppression (VS, &#x0003c;400 copies
HIV RNA/ml) was measured in all HIV-positive PC participants at 24m.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>The PC included 48,301 participants. Baseline HIV prevalence was similar across study
arms (21%-22%). Between months 12-36, 553 incident HIV infections were observed over
39,702 person-years (py; 1.4/100py; women: 1.7/100py; men: 0.8/100py). Adjusted
rate-ratios were A vs. C: 0.93 (95%CI: 0.74-1.18, p=0.51); B vs. C: 0.70 (95%CI:
0.55-0.88, p=0.006). At 24m, VS was 71.9% in Arm A; 67.5% in Arm B; and 60.2% in Arm C.
ART coverage after 36m was 81% in Arm A and 80% in Arm B.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PopART intervention with ART per local guidelines reduced HIV incidence by 30%. The
lack of effect with universal ART was surprising and inconsistent with VS data. This
study provides evidence that UTT can reduce HIV incidence at population level.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01900977</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2017, ~37 million people were living with HIV worldwide, with 1.8 million new
infections.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> HIV incidence is
declining worldwide, but is unlikely to reach the UNAIDS target of &#x0003c;500,000 new
infections by 2020.<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Steep reductions
in incidence are needed to curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p><p>Universal testing and treatment (UTT) has been proposed as an important component of HIV
combination prevention programs.<sup><xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The HPTN 052 trial showed that early
antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation dramatically reduced HIV transmission among
couples<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, and the PARTNER study showed that viral suppression
(&#x0003c;200 copies/ml) prevented HIV sexual transmission.<sup><xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Mathematical
modeling predicted that HIV incidence would fall steeply if HIV testing were delivered
throughout a population and ART initiated immediately after diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Early ART also confers individual health benefits.<sup><xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In 2015, the World Health Organization updated its guidelines
recommending immediate ART for all HIV-positive individuals<sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and UNAIDS proposed 90-90-90 HIV testing and treatment
targets (by 2020: 90% of HIV-positive individuals should know their status; 90% of those
individuals should be on ART; and 90% of those on ART should be virally
suppressed).<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>While there is compelling evidence supporting UTT for HIV prevention, it was not clear
whether UTT could be implemented effectively at population level and impact HIV incidence.
Four community-randomized trials (CRTs) in sub-Saharan Africa addressed these questions; two
(TasP and SEARCH) reported no impact of UTT on HIV incidence; a third (Ya Tsie) reported a
30% reduction in incidence, of borderline statistical significance.<sup><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The fourth study, HPTN 071 (PopART), is the largest HIV prevention trial
ever conducted. Here, we present the primary results of HPTN 071 (PopART); we also describe
the uptake of the PopART intervention and its impact on viral suppression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was designed by members of the Study Team with input from the sponsor, funders

Zambia and Western Cape Province, South Africa (total population ~1 million; average
~50,000/community). Each community was the catchment population of a government clinic.
Communities were arranged in seven triplets matched on geographical location and estimated
HIV prevalence. Communities in each triplet were randomly allocated to three study arms in
simultaneous public ceremonies. Restricted randomization was used to ensure balance across
study arms on population size, baseline ART coverage and HIV prevalence.<sup><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>The three study arms are shown in Figure S1. Arm A communities received the PopART
intervention (see below) with universal ART. Arm B communities received the PopART
intervention with ART provided according to local guidelines. Arm C communities did not
receive the PopART intervention, but received standard-of-care at government clinics,
including HIV testing and ART offered according to local guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Intervention</title><p>The PopART intervention, delivered to Arm A and B communities only, was a combination
prevention package (Figure S2). Specially trained community health workers (Community
HIV-care Providers, CHiPs) delivered services at annual household visits (see
supplementary text). CHiPs worked in pairs, each pair responsible for ~500 households.
Data collected by CHiPs were used primarily to support service delivery but also to
evaluate intervention coverage.</p><p>At each visit, CHiPs offered HIV counseling and rapid testing, and provided support for
linkage to care and ART adherence for HIV-positive clients. They referred uncircumcised
HIV-negative men for voluntary medical male circumcision and HIV-positive pregnant women
for antenatal care including prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. CHiPs also
screened clients for symptoms of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, with
referral for diagnosis and treatment, and promoted and provided condoms.</p><p>In all 21 communities, HIV care and ART were provided at local government clinics. In Arm
A, these clinics offered ART irrespective of CD4 count throughout the trial, with written
consent for those initiating ART outside of local guidelines until universal ART became
standard. In Arms B and C, the clinics provided ART initially at a CD4 threshold of 350
cells/ml, which increased to 500 cells/ml in 2014. Universal ART was offered from April
2016 (Zambia) and October 2016 (S Africa) (Figure S3).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Outcome evaluation</title><p>The effect of the intervention on population-level HIV incidence was measured in a
Population Cohort (PC) (enrolled December 2013-March 2015) that included one
randomly-selected adult aged 18-44 years from a random sample of households in each
community (Figure S4). PC participants were surveyed at baseline (PC0) and after 12, 24
and 36 months (PC12/PC24/PC36).</p><p>Because the original enrollment target (2,500 adults/community) was not reached in PC0,
additional participants were enrolled at 12 months (PC12N) and in arms A and C only at 24
months (PC24N), excluding households sampled previously.</p><p>At each visit, PC participants were interviewed by a field research assistant (separate
from the CHiPs) using a structured questionnaire that included collection of demographic,
socio-economic and behavioral data, as well as data related to HIV prevention, diagnosis
and treatment; data were collected electronically. Following the interview, blood was
collected by a research nurse, who also offered HIV rapid testing to all PC
participants.</p><p>The pre-defined primary study outcome was HIV incidence between PC12 and PC36, comparing
Arm A and Arm B to Arm C. This approach provided one year to fully establish the study
intervention before measuring study outcomes. Other outcomes reported here include viral
suppression (VS, &#x0003c; 400 copies HIV RNA/ml) and the estimated coverage of HIV testing
and ART based on CHiPs data from Arms A and B.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>Laboratory-based HIV testing was performed for all PC participants at all visits. Central
laboratories in South Africa and Zambia performed a single 4<sup>th</sup> generation HIV
test. The HPTN Laboratory Center (LC, Baltimore, MD USA) performed additional testing to
determine HIV status (see supplementary text). If seroconversion was confirmed, testing
was performed to determine if the participant had acute infection at the prior visit. HIV
viral load testing was performed at the HPTN LC for selected samples: all HIV-positive
participants at PC24, and a random subset of ~75 HIV-positive participants per community
at PC0, PC12 and PC36. HIV Viral load testing was performed using the Abbott Realtime
HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, Il) utilizing a &#x0003c;400 HIV RNA/ml
threshold.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>Sample size calculations were informed by initial projections of intervention effect
based on mathematical modeling<sup><xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> which suggested that HIV incidence might
be reduced by up to 60% in Arm A and 25% in Arm B, compared with Arm C. Assuming HIV
incidence in Arm C of 1.0 to 1.5 per 100 person-years (py), a between-community
coefficient of variation (k) within matched triplets of 0.15-0.20, 2,500 PC
participants/community with 85% HIV-negative at baseline, and 25% loss to follow-up over
three years, study power would exceed 75% or 85% for effects of 35% or 40%,
respectively.</p><p>Analysis methods are described in detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan, completed
before data unblinding.<sup><xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Briefly,
HIV incidence was measured in PC participants who were HIV-negative at enrollment; HIV
infection was assumed to occur at the mid-point between the last HIV-negative and the
first HIV-positive sample, or at a visit where acute infection was identified. When timing
of infection was unclear because of missed visits, the time of infection was estimated by
imputation (see supplementary text and Table S1). For the primary outcome, statistical
inference used a two-stage approach recommended for CRTs with &#x0003c;15
clusters/arm.<sup><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> At the first stage, Poisson regression on data from all
three study arms was used to compute E, the expected number of events (incident HIV
infections) in each community, after adjusting for age, sex and baseline HIV prevalence,
assuming a null intervention effect. At the second stage, two-way analysis of variance was
carried out on log(O/E) (log ratio-residuals), where O was the observed number of events
in each community, with matched triplet and study arm as factors. The test statistic is
the estimated difference in means of log(O/E) between study arms, with two-sided p-values
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed using the t-distribution. The corresponding
rate ratios and 95%CI for the comparison of Arms A and C, and Arms B and C, were
calculated with exponentiation. Similar methods were used for the analysis of viral
suppression, except that logistic regression was used at the first stage without
adjustment for HIV prevalence. The robustness of the above analyses was assessed using a
permutation test based on the restricted randomization scheme.</p><p>Because the analysis plan did not include a method for controlling type I error when
conducting treatment comparisons for subgroup and <italic>post-hoc</italic> analyses,
treatment effects are reported with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (which
have not been adjusted for multiplicity and should not be used to infer treatment
effects).</p><p>In Arms A and B, CHiPs data were used to estimate the proportion of HIV-positive
community members who knew their HIV status and were on ART, using methods and assumptions
described in supplementary text.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>PC participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. Community members
visited by CHiPs provided verbal consent for participation in the intervention and data
collection. In Arm A, clinic patients provided written informed consent when ART was
initiated outside of prevailing local guidelines (2013-2016).</p><p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by ethics committees at the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of Zambia, and Stellenbosch University.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Enrollment and follow-up</title><p>The CONSORT diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>) shows the
enrollment and follow-up of PC participants; 38,474 adults were enrolled at baseline
(PC0), with 5,014 and 4,813 additional enrollments at PC12N and PC24N, respectively (total
enrolled: 48,301).</p><p>At PC12, and again at PC24, 13% of PC participants were terminated from the study, most
because of confirmed permanent relocation out of the study community (Table S2), and were
censored from further observation; ~75% of remaining participants completed each visit.
The final survey (PC36) reached 72% of eligible participants. Retention was similar across
study arms at PC36 (73%, 73% and 71% in Arms A, B and C, respectively).</p><fig id="f0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram showing enrollment and follow-up of the Population Cohort.</p><p>HPTN 071 (PopART) included 21 communities that were matched in seven sets of three

representative sample of residents to assess the impact of the PopART intervention on
HIV incidence and viral suppression. Participants in the PC were enrolled from
randomly selected households in the community; with one member aged 18-44 selected at

B, HIV incidence was reduced by 30% compared to the standard-of-care control arm;
surprisingly, there was no evidence of such an effect in Arm A.</p><p>The Arm B effect was consistent with pre-study model projections and was observed in both
countries.<sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Reduction in
incidence was seen in all seven matched triplets in Arm B; this effect was very unlikely to
have occurred by chance. UTT is hypothesized to reduce HIV transmission by increasing the
proportion of HIV-positive community members who know their HIV status, the proportion of
those individuals who are on ART, and the proportion of those on ART who are virally
suppressed. Data from this study indicate that the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets were achieved by
the end of the 3-year intervention in both Arm A and B communities. High levels of VS were
observed among HIV-positive PC participants after 24m (~72%, increased from the baseline
level of ~55%). This corresponds to a ~35% drop in the proportion of HIV-positive
participants not virally suppressed, from ~45% to ~28%, consistent with the observed 30%
reduction in HIV incidence in Arm B. The greater reduction in HIV incidence among men likely
reflects greater uptake of the intervention and higher VS in women (thus protecting their
male partners); a similar explanation applies for higher effectiveness in those aged over 25
years.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the lack of an effect on HIV incidence when the
PopART intervention was combined with universal ART (Arm A vs. Arm C). First, written
informed consent was required for initiation of ART outside local guidelines from the start
of the trial until 2016 (see supplementary text). This requirement for &#x0201c;research
consent&#x0201d; may inadvertently have discouraged ART initiation, although this is not
supported by data that show similar ART coverage and VS in Arms A and B. Second, wide-scale
ART delivery in Arm A may have led to sexual disinhibition or de-emphasis of primary
prevention messaging by CHiPs, offsetting the observed increase in VS. Data on self-reported
risk behaviors do not support this hypothesis; further analyses are planned once data on
HSV-2 seroconversion (a proxy for sexual risk behavior) become available. Third, while the
three study arms appeared well matched with respect to baseline data, there may have been
unrecognized differences across triplets in socio-demographic or other factors, such as
mobility and migration resulting in exposure to HIV-positive partners from other
communities.</p><p>While these urban communities had high mobility, analysis of available data do not suggest
any appreciable differences in migration across study arms. Further analyses of qualitative
and quantitative data from the study communities, and data from an ongoing phylogenetic
study, may shed light on the unexpected Arm A result.</p><p>Strengths of the study included the large sample size, enrollment of a randomly-sampled
cohort to measure HIV incidence and VS at community level, delivery of ART through routine
services at government clinics, the availability of extensive process data used to improve
and refine delivery of the intervention, and strong community engagement. While our study
communities were not chosen to be representative of Zambia or South Africa as a whole,
conduct of the study in large urban communities with high rates of mobility should increase
the generalizability of the findings to other urban areas of Southern Africa with
generalized HIV epidemics.</p><p>A limitation of the study was the relatively small number of randomized communities
(seven/arm). The difference in observed effects in Arm A vs C and B vs C may thus be a
chance finding, given the similar levels of ART coverage and VS in Arms A and B, and the
similar nature of the Arm A and B interventions during most of the primary analysis period.
To evaluate the overall effect of the PopART intervention vs standard of care, we therefore
conducted a <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis combining Arms A and B and found an estimated
rate ratio of 0.81 (95%CI:0.66-0.99) compared with Arm C, consistent with a 20% reduction in
incidence. Another limitation is that data on uptake of interventions among HIV-positive
participants in the PC may be subject to a Hawthorne effect, because participants had
regular contact with research staff offering HIV testing and providing referral to care. We
would expect the Hawthorne effect to be greatest in Arm C, where PC participants did not
have access to CHiP services for testing and referral. Thus, for uptake estimates we rely
mainly on intervention data, which were only available from Arm A and B communities. Lastly,
men were under-represented in the PC, and a substantial number of PC participants moved out
of the community during follow-up and were censored from further observation. Thus, we
cannot rule out selection bias although there was no evidence that these factors differed
between study arms. Since men were under-represented in the PC, and a greater effect of the
intervention was observed in men, the population-level effect may have been
underestimated.</p><p>The results of HPTN 071 (PopART) are consistent with programmatic and survey data<sup><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, and should be considered alongside those of the other three trials that
measured the effect of UTT on HIV incidence in Africa, all of which were smaller and
undertaken in largely rural communities. The TasP trial<sup><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> found no effect on HIV incidence, which may have reflected
the similar HIV testing services provided in the intervention and control arms, with low
levels of ART coverage in both arms. The SEARCH trial<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> also found no effect on HIV incidence, which may have
reflected intensive baseline community-based HIV testing in both intervention and control
arms. The Ya Tsie trial<sup><xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> observed a
30% reduction in incidence, which was of borderline statistical significance given the
relatively small numbers of HIV seroconversion events.</p><p>Our finding of a 20-30% reduction in HIV incidence at population level was measured against
a background of decreasing incidence in Arm C, possibly attributable to gradually increasing
coverage of ART in the general population. This indicates that combination prevention
including UTT can make a substantial contribution to HIV epidemic control. Importantly, the
effects seen in our study, Ya Tsie study and others<sup><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> were achieved by delivering intensive household-based HIV-testing
services; this may have played a more important role than changes in ART guidelines. The
universal &#x0201c;test&#x0201d; component of a &#x0201c;test-and-treat&#x0201d; strategy is
vital, as is continued attention to primary HIV prevention interventions.<sup><xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Results from planned cost-effectiveness and modeling studies will provide
information on the value-for-money and long-term impact of such strategies which will help
to inform policy and practice. ART coverage data from HPTN 071 (PopART), like data from
other studies, draws special attention to the challenges in achieving ART coverage targets
in young people, men, and communities with high mobility.<sup><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> If HIV
transmission is concentrated in these subgroups, impact of UTT on HIV transmission may be
compromised. Special efforts will be needed to address these coverage gaps to realize the
full impact of UTT on HIV epidemic control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><media xlink:href="NEJM-2019-1814556-s1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>HPTN 071 (PopART) is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
