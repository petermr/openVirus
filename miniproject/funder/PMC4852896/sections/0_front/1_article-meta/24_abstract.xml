 <p>Researchers have recently raised suspicion that the Ebola virus can be transmitted sexually from survivors after recovering from the life-threatening acute phase characteristic of Ebola virus disease (EVD). However, the nature of the impact sexual transmission from convalescent survivors may have on disease dynamics remains unknown. Mathematical models are useful for translating empirical uncertainty into a range of possible outcomes. We formalized an epidemiological model that accounts for a secondary route of transmission of EVD through sexual contact with otherwise healthy survivors. We found that while very few additional cases are expected, a 3-month period of convalescent infectivity could extend the 2014–2015 Sierra Leone epidemic by nearly 3 months, and a 6-month convalescent period could double the current length by extending it an additional 18 months. Our results reveal that measures to reduce sexual contact between survivors and susceptible individuals are not likely to have a major impact on the length of time affected public health communities must remain vigilant, and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance efforts.</p>
