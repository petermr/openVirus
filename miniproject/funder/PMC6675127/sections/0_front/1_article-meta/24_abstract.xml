 <p>Reliable mortality information is of paramount importance to establish sound public health policies. Autopsy is an important tool not only for determining the cause of death, but also for the detection of novel diseases. In the last decades, we have been globally identifying an unprecedented number of emerging infections. Therefore, there is great interest in the development of less invasive and low-cost tools for the accurate post-mortem diagnosis in fatal cases. Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA), conceived as targeting diagnostic biopsies of key organs by needle puncture, has been proposed as an alternative to conventional autopsy (CA) for the determination of cause of death in developing countries. In this research, we tested the efficacy of MIA in the post-mortem diagnosis of 20 patients with suspected or confirmed yellow fever who died during the recent epidemic of yellow fever that occurred in Brazil. There was a perfect agreement between MIA and CA in determining the cause of death (hepatic failure) and main disease (yellow fever) in all patients with confirmed yellow fever. This finding indicates that MIA can be used as an alternative to CA in regions at risk for infectious disease outbreaks with limited resources to perform conventional autopsies.</p>
