  <p>Transmission intensity and seasonal time window of dengue epidemic potential in 10 European cities for (A) 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (B) 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Intensity was defined as the averaged 
   <italic>VC</italic> over the highest consecutive 3-months for each decade. Transmission window was defined as the number of months when the decade averaged 
   <italic>VC</italic> was over the threshold value (0.2 day
   <sup>− 1</sup>). Historical temperatures (CRU-TS3.22 (
   <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., n.d.</xref>)) were used from 1901 to 2009. From 2011 to 2099, two emission pathways (CMIP5 (
   <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>, 
   <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Warszawski et al., 2014</xref>)) were evaluated: RCP2.6 (i &amp; ii) and RCP8.5 (iii &amp; iv).
