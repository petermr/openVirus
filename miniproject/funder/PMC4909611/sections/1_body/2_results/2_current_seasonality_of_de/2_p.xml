 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the season-stratified maps of Europe's DEP during the recent decade (2006–2015) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(i)) compared to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(ii)) and current distribution of 
 <italic>Ae.</italic> vectors either introduced or established (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(iii)) (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). Currently Europe is infested by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mainly in the Mediterranean area but expanding northward, while only three areas have recently reported 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, Georgia and southwestern portions of Russia, in addition to Madeira Island, Portugal (not shown on map) (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). The threshold value of 0.2 day
 <sup>− 1</sup> corresponds to yellow color (see color bar). In areas with 
 <italic>VC</italic> above this threshold (yellow-orange to dark red) during a given time period, dengue outbreaks may commence assuming prerequisite populations of vectors, susceptible human hosts, and virus introduction coincide. Areas during time periods displayed in blue to yellow green would not be expected to be suitable for dengue outbreaks to begin even if vectors were present and importations of dengue virus were persistent. Strong seasonality is apparent: 
 <italic>VC</italic> was not sufficiently high in Europe in the winter, spring, and autumn seasons to allow dengue epidemic transmission to commence using the threshold value of 0.2 day
 <sup>− 1</sup>, except for small areas in the very southern parts of Southern Europe during spring and autumn. In the summer season, the majority of continental Europe for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and southern and partially central parts of Europe for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have climate conditions and corresponding 
 <italic>VC</italic> that could sustain seasonal dengue epidemics. Therefore, if the primary vector, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, established in the other parts of Europe in the future, it could have greater DEP than the established and invasive secondary vector, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>.
