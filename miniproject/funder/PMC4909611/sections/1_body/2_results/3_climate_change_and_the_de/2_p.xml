 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows the season-stratified maps of Europe's DEP during the last decade of the 21st century under greenhouse gas emission pathways RCP2.6 (i &amp; iv) and RCP8.5 (ii &amp; iii) for two 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors. DTR was included and 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> = 1.5. Differences in 
 <italic>VC</italic> for the four seasons are clearly shown. DEP is almost zero during the winter, then growing from small regions in the Southern Europe during the Spring, increasing intensity and expanding geographically during Summer, before contracting again in Fall. The differences in 
 <italic>VC</italic> between the two climate scenarios and two 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors are apparent in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Under the most mitigation climate scenario (RCP2.6), during the Summer season, DEP is limited to the Southern and the Central Europe for both vectors. Under the business as usual climate scenario (RCP8.5), DEP extends into Northern Europe for both 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors. Under both climate scenarios, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> showed higher intensity in more areas than 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. By the end of this century, the highest DEP region during summer season would be in the Central Eastern parts of the Europe, in addition to parts of the coastal areas of Southern Europe already having high DEP in the recent decade as shown in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.
