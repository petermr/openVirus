<p>During the current decade (2011–2019) under both RCPs, for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> the intensity threshold (0.2 day
 <sup>− 1</sup>) will be surpassed in seven cities (n
 <sub>i</sub>
 <sup>a</sup> = 7) (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A (i) &amp; (iii)) and duration threshold (three months) in four cities (n

 <sup>a</sup> = 4) (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A (ii) &amp; (iv)). For 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, the intensity threshold will be surpassed for only four cities (n
 <sub>i</sub>
 <sup>b</sup> = 4) in (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B (i) &amp; (iii)) and the duration threshold for three cities (n
 <sub>d</sub>
 <sup>b</sup> = 3) (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B (ii) &amp; (iv)). From 2020 to 2099, under RCP2.6 for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, the same results were observed for the intensity of (n
 <sub>i</sub>
 <sup>a</sup> = 7) except two cities with short periods of over the threshold (London: 2050s–2070s and Amsterdam: 2060s–2070s); the number of cities with duration over the threshold will be increased from four to five at 2020s and to six starting 2040s to the end of this century (n
 <sub>d</sub>
 <sup>a</sup> = 6). For 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, the number of cities with intensity over the threshold will be increased from four to five continuously (n
 <sub>i</sub>
 <sup>b</sup> = 5) with one city (Berlin) over the threshold for only short time (2060s); the number of cities with duration over threshold remains the same (n
 <sub>d</sub>
 <sup>b</sup> = 3). However, under RCP8.5, for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> all the 10 cities are projected to be over the thresholds in both intensity and duration (n
 <sub>i</sub>
 <sup>a</sup> = 10 by 2050s, n
 <sub>d</sub>
 <sup>a</sup> = 10 by 2080s); for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, all 10 cities in intensity and seven cities in duration (n
 <sub>i</sub>
 <sup>b</sup> = 10 by 2080s, n
 <sub>d</sub>
 <sup>b</sup> = 7 by 2080s); this is a notable increase in DEP over the projections for RCP2.6 for both dengue vectors.
