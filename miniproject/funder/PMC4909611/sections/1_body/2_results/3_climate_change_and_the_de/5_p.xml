 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows the intensity and duration of dengue transmission over two centuries for 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic> (

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). ‘Intensity’ was defined as the averaged 
 <italic>VC</italic> over the highest three consecutive months for each decade, and ‘duration’ of transmission window was defined as the number of months when a decade's averaged 
 <italic>VC</italic> was over the transmission threshold value (0.2 day
 <sup>− 1</sup>). Three months was used as the threshold in duration, reasoning that importation-driven epidemics of dengue would take several transmission generations to propagate in human and vector populations before the first reported cases of dengue are identified as was observed with Madeira in 2012 (
