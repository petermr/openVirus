 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows the trend in seasonality over two centuries (1901–2099) for the 10 European cities for

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). For each city, 30-year averaged 
 <italic>VC</italic> was estimated for three periods: Past (1901–1930) (i), Current (1984–2013) (ii), and Future (2070–2099) (iii–vi). We used historical temperature data from 1901 to 2013 and projected temperatures from 2011 to 2099 under five climate scenarios (CMIP5 (

Strong seasonality was observed in all cities over all periods and scenarios. Compared to the past, the current period shows an increase in the magnitude and the width of the peak in 
 <italic>VC</italic> in central to Northern European cities (n = 7 including Madeira) while the Southern cities (n = 3) remained about the same (the magnitude of the peak was slightly reduced in Athens and increased in Rome).
