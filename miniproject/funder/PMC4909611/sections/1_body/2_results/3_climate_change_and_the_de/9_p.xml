<p>For 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, under RCP2.6 there is no difference between the future and past – only the Southern three cities, Málaga, Athens and Rome, had the potential for dengue outbreaks. Under RCP8.5, Nice will have sufficient DEP (2030s), followed by Paris (2060s), Berlin (2070s) and Madeira (2080s). Therefore, the gap in dengue epidemic duration between the two RCPs widens toward the end of this century - an 
 <italic>increase</italic> of four cities between the two RCPs.
