<p>Increasing globalization in travel and trade will intensify the importation of dengue viruses and the potential for further introduction of

 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Gubler and Clark, 1995</xref>). If such introductions coincide with suitable vectorial capacity, those cities at the time intervals identified in this study have potential for local dengue transmission. Dengue epidemic outbreak is a complex process involving many factors, with mean temperature and diurnal temperature range just being two of many. This study based on vectorial capacity helps to identify cities and areas with high DEP and the seasonal time windows when such cities are at the highest risk currently and in the future under climate change. Our findings illustrate that besides vector control, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is very important in reducing DEP for Europe especially toward the latter half of this century.
