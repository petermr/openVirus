<p>Of major concern is the geographic expansion of dengue viruses and vectors to new areas (

 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2009</xref>). Reasons for the expansion are complex; however, main contributing factors include the introduction of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes by shipping (
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Reiter, 1998</xref>) and increasingly importation of the dengue virus via viremic travelers (

 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Wilder-Smith and Gubler, 2008</xref>). Subsequent establishment of vectors after introduction can only be possible if suitable climate and ecological conditions exist. Having established populations of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors and the conducive climatic conditions, in early autumn 2014, Tokyo, Japan recorded the first epidemic of dengue since the Second World War (
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Quam et al., 2016</xref>). Europe is also suitable for the establishment and re-establishment of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes as evidenced by the following: 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was historically present in many European countries including UK and France (1919), Spain (up to 1953), Portugal (up to 1956), and recently the Netherlands, Russia and Georgia (

 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). In Madeira, Portugal, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was documented until 1977–79 and then was re-established in 2004 and 2005. Madeira experienced its first major dengue outbreak in 2012/2013, with more than 2000 cases (

 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Wilder-Smith et al., 2014a</xref>). The rapidly expanding range of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Europe (

 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2013</xref>) resulted in the first known autochthonous dengue cases in southern France and Croatia in 2010 (
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">La Ruche et al., 2010</xref>) in addition to an importation 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> driven outbreak of chikungunya in 2007 in Italy (
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Rezza et al., 2007</xref>). There are concerns that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> could be introduced from Russia and Georgia (Abkhazia) to Western Europe via air or sea traffic, and to Eastern Europe via road and sea traffic, in addition to the vectors' projected establishment in Southern Europe (
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Rogers, 2015</xref>). Current surveillance indicates that 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors have been introduced or established in much of the Mediterranean coast and as far north as the Netherlands (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is important to assess the dengue epidemic potential (DEP) in Europe.
