<p>A few studies have projected dengue risk and epidemic potential for Europe. They have used either statistical models (

 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>) or vectorial capacity (

 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>), a Mathematical model, however, with limited range either geographically, temporally or in terms of climate scenarios. In this study, we intend to estimate DEP for Europe using vectorial capacity with increased range of climate scenarios and temporal resolution. Although DEP depends on many factors, this study focuses on the effect of temperature – past, present, and future – on vectorial capacity of
