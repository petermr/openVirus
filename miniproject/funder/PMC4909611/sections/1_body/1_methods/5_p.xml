<p>To generate recent European season-stratified maps of 
 <italic>VC</italic> (Jan. 1, 2006–Dec. 31, 2015), daily temperature observations (minimum, maximum, and mean) from the E-OBS 12.0 dataset were used for each location gridded at 0.25 × 0.25° (about 25 × 25 km at the equator) latitude and longitude (

 <italic>VC</italic> calculation included interpolating DTR based on daily observations, then aggregated over the decade by season (Winter: December–February; Spring: March–May; Summer: June–August; Autumn: September–November). The seasonal averaged 
 <italic>VC</italic> for the recent decade were displayed as maps for Europe for each season for both vectors and compared to a recent survey of vector distribution (
