<p>To show the seasonal window and its change over time, a 30-year average was used for each monthly averaged 
 <italic>VC</italic> at three periods – the beginning of the 20th century (1901–1930), at the turn from 20th to 21st century (1984–2013), and the end of the 21st century (2070–2099). Future 
 <italic>VC</italic> was calculated using projected climate under four greenhouse gas emission pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) (
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Weyant et al., 2009</xref>) based on CMIP5 (
 <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Warszawski et al., 2014</xref>) atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. For each emission pathway, CMIP5 temperature datasets (min, max, mean resolution 0.5 × 0.5°) were used (

 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Warszawski et al., 2014</xref>). The 
 <italic>VC</italic> was calculated for each of the five global models (NorESM1-M, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, IPSL-CM5A-LR, HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M) and then averaged over the five models (

 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Warszawski et al., 2014</xref>). We used these models as an ensemble to form a multi-model mean, with the intention of providing results that are based on greater consensus. The four RCP scenarios describe the possible range of radiative forcing of greenhouse gases in the year 2100 (+ 2.6, + 4.5, + 6.0, and + 8.5 W m

 <italic>VC</italic> calculations were aggregated by decade to show the trends in DEP over two centuries. A selection of the outputs of these projection-based 
 <italic>VC</italic> calculations was also mapped for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for both species to show the changes in DEP across Europe under scenarios of greater or lesser emission mitigation.
