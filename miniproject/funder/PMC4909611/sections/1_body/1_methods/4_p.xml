<p>The threshold cut-off for DEP was defined as 
 <italic>VC</italic>* = 0.2 (day
 <sup>− 1</sup>). Here we assume that an epidemic potential is realized when 
 <italic>VC</italic> reaches a level such that one infected person will infect at least one more person after dengue is introduced into a naïve population during his/her five-day infectious period (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and Fig. S5B for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>). This corresponds to a range of thresholds for DEP from 0.1 to 0.25 (day
 <sup>− 1</sup>). We have chosen the threshold value of 0.2 (day
 <sup>− 1</sup>), which is closer to the higher end of this range, to be conservative in our results presented.
