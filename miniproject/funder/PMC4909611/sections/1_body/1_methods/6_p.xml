<p>To show seasonality of 
 <italic>VC</italic> over a year, decade averages of 
 <italic>VC</italic> for each month was displayed as a function of the month in a year. For the recent decade, 13 cities were chosen to compare seasonality of DEP. Ten European cities were selected to represent most of the European continent with different temperature zones from the north — Stockholm (latitude = 59.3) to the south — Málaga (latitude = 36.7) within the continent and Madeira (latitude = 32.7) outside the continent. Madeira is an autonomous region of Portugal having a dengue outbreak in 2012, and for convenience in this paper, we will use the name of 
 <italic>city</italic> for all the nine cities and Madeira region. Three reference cities from tropical and sub-tropical regions outside Europe were chosen for comparison. Colombo and Singapore are located in Asia close to the equator and display high dengue endemicity (

By contrast Miami, located in North America with a sub-tropical climate with more similarity in environmental and social economic conditions to some of Southern Europe, has reported autochthonous dengue transmission occasionally, which typically does not develop into large scale epidemics (
