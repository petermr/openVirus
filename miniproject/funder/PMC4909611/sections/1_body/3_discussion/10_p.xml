<p>The time variable in this study was longitudinal – from 1901 to 2099 divided in 20 decades, in which for each decade monthly 
 <italic>VC</italic> was estimated. All the existing models on dengue risk mapping regardless the model types – mathematical or statistical, give one or a few cross-sectional estimations, such as, one year (

 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>) were used to estimated climate change impacts on dengue fever risk in Europe (more discussion in Supplementary information, Section S7.1), very limited information (
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Patz et al., 1998</xref>) can be found on seasonality in the current literature for European DEP or dengue risk over an extended time period under all climate change scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the only study on the European DEP communicating findings at the monthly time scale over two centuries including historical observations and four climate projections into the future. This information is important for dengue control planning and may in turn underscore the need for emissions reductions, echoing and supporting ratification of the Paris Agreement, a treaty on greenhouse gas emission reductions formed at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (
