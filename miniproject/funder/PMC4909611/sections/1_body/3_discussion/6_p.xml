<p>Since 1928, there has only been one dengue epidemic in Europe–Madeira 2012 with over 2000 cases transmitted through 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (

 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Wilder-Smith et al., 2014b</xref>). Using local weather station temperature data for the current decade, 
 <italic>VC</italic> for Madeira was well over the threshold from June to October (Fig. S1 in Supplementary information). Therefore, our findings are consistent with the large dengue outbreak that occurred in 2012 (
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2012</xref>). The decline of new incident cases after November 9, 2012 was most likely due to declining 
 <italic>VC</italic> because of cooler temperatures combined with enhanced vector control measures and public awareness. While our findings contribute valuable insight into the timing of the outbreak potential in Madeira, the introduction of vector predated the outbreak by years, and the climate based DEP predated both for a number of months each year. This illustrates that commencement of an actual dengue outbreak involves complex processes and more factors than what we have addressed here. Of note is that 
 <italic>VC</italic> for Athens, Rome and Málaga is higher than that for Madeira even using local weather station data (
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">UK Meteorological Office, n.d.</xref>), yet no dengue outbreaks recently occurred in those cities likely in part due to the absence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. However, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> may be introduced or re-introduced at any time. Our findings underpin the suitability of temperature dependent 
 <italic>VC</italic> in countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece that could result in autochthonous dengue transmission should 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> be imported and establish. Indeed, when 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was present in Greece in the early 20th century, a major dengue outbreak occurred in and around Athens in 1927–28 (
 <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Theiler et al., 1960</xref>). Furthermore, over 20 epidemics of yellow fever, another flavivirus (like dengue) transmitted via 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries around British, Portuguese, and Spanish harbors, with the last outbreak being in Barcelona, Spain in 1821 (
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Morillon et al., 2002</xref>). With climate change, recent studies projected the re-establishment of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the coastal zones of Europe in 2080 (
