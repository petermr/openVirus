<p>Over time, the intensity and seasonal windows for DEP has increased and is projected to continue increasing. As a result, more cities will be over the 
 <italic>VC</italic> threshold starting from the South and progressing to the North during this century. However, the rate of the increase depends on the emission pathway for both vectors, especially toward the middle of the century. The same trend is observed even when using the lower bound of 
 <italic>VC</italic> (95% CI) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (see Supplementary information, Section S6.2). This implies a significant potential benefit, if policies for climate change mitigation are implemented such that future emissions more closely reflect RCP2.6.
