<p>Second, the uncertainty in the vector and human parameters affect the value of DEP through 
 <italic>VC</italic> and the threshold value for intensity. All six vector parameters depend on temperature. The female vector-to-human population ratio depends on temperature the same way as longevity (

These relationships may vary depending on the environmental conditions of the study location/laboratory/design, vector and virus types. The uncertainty of each parameter and its temperature dependent relation were not available. Thus, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the uncertainty for each parameter and their effect on 
 <italic>VC</italic>, from which the seasonality for the 10 European cities - see Supplementary information (Section S6.1–S6.2) for details. In addition, although we chose the threshold value more conservatively (0.2 day
 <sup>− 1</sup> within the range of 0.1–0.25 day
 <sup>− 1</sup> corresponding to infectious period of 4 to 10 days), the estimated intensity and duration for DEP should be viewed with caution. If different threshold values were used, the general trend and order of cities that would go over the threshold will hold, but the exact decade when the DEP goes over the threshold could change. However, using the threshold of 0.2 day
 <sup>− 1</sup> in the analysis of both the outbreak in Madeira in 2012 and the 2014 dengue outbreak in Japan, we found that this threshold corresponded spatially and temporally with the novel transmission events (
