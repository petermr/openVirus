predominant causative pathogen of HFMD. Since 2015, two inactivated EV71 vaccines have been approved in mainland China, and because their use could change the HFMD pathogen spectrum, this should now be monitored. However, the epidemiological and genetic trends of EV71 with respect to HFMD in Guangxi, southern China, are still not clear. In this study, we describe the epidemiological and genetic characterization of this virus in clinically-diagnosed HFMD reported from 2010 to 2015 in Guangxi. Data showed that a two-year epidemic cycle, with a predominance of EV71 infections, contributed to HFMD outbreaks in Guangxi. Furthermore, this virus is a major causative agent of severe and fatal HFMD. Interestingly, in Guangxi, EV71-positive rates tended to decrease over time. In particular, EV71-positive rates were found in Fangchenggang city, which reported very few severe and fatal cases over the six-year period. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene revealed that the major circulating strains belonged exclusively to genotype C, subtype 4a (C4a), and most clustered with strains circulating in southern China. The most interesting finding was that a strain isolated in 2012 clustered with Vietnamese strains isolated from 2011&#x02013;2012. The data highlight the importance of pathogen surveillance for HFMD in China, especially Guangxi, which is located on the border of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Key research projects of medical and health care of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Center</institution></funding-source><award-id>2012051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5898-7771</contrib-id><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Minmei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Key research projects of medical and health care of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Center (2012051).The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Health and Familiy Planning Commision.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gxhfpc.gov.cn/">http://www.gxhfpc.gov.cn/</ext-link>.The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All VP1 sequence files are available from the Genebank database (GenBank accession numbers MF185255-185311).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All VP1 sequence files are available from the Genebank database (GenBank accession numbers MF185255-185311).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood infectious disease that is normally self-limiting; however, in few cases, there can be serious complications with the nervous and respiratory systems, which can lead to death. HFMD is a considerable global public health challenge, especially in the Asia-Pacific region [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since 2008, the numbers of HFMD cases that have been reported by national disease control and prevention agencies have increased significantly in China, with a total of 344,688 cases, and 25 deaths, recorded from January 1 to May 10 of 2017.</p><p>HFMD is caused by members of the enterovirus family, among which <italic>human enterovirus 71</italic> (EV71) and <italic>coxsackievirus A16</italic> are the main pathogens responsible for global outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EV71 infection has been reported to be responsible for both severe and fatal HFMD [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On December 3, 2015, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) approved two inactivated EV71 whole-virus vaccines for preventing severe HFMD [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, EV71 vaccination began in Guangxi from 2016 and continues to date. Because this might change the HFMD pathogen spectrum, monitoring EV71 epidemics at different times and geographical locations remains a high priority.</p><p>The Guangxi autonomous region is located in the south of China, and is divided into fourteen cities; it is one of the Chinese provinces that is most affected by HFMD [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Guangxi, the number of reported cases has increased from 2008 to 2015, and since 2008, the incidence and rate of severe and fatal cases has consistently been the highest in China. In addition, from January 1 to May 10 of 2017, the number of reported cases (46,674) and incidence (97/10,000) were highest in Guangxi, among 31 Chinese provinces. Elucidating the epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of E71 is critical for guiding the development of HFMD prevention and control strategies. This study focused on characterizing the epidemiological profiles and molecular evolution of EV71 in HFMD in the Guangxi autonomous region from January 2010 to December 2015. The results therefore provide information describing the baseline HFMD pathogen profile before vaccination was implemented.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Disease Control and Prevention of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Specimens were obtained from sentinel hospitals associated with the Center of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangxi CDC) for EV surveillance. It was determined by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China that data collection for HFMD cases was part of continuous public health surveillance for a notifiable infectious disease and was thus exempt from institutional review board assessment.

The diagnosis criteria for HFMD, severe cases, and laboratory test procedures followed the HFMD Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2010). Mild cases were defined as the absence or presence of fever accompanied by a rash (maculopapule or vesicular rash) appearing on either the hand, foot, mouth, or buttock. Severe cases were defined the presence of at least one of the following complications: acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, pulmonary edema, encephalitis, hemorrhage, or cardiopulmonary collapse. Clinically diagnosed cases, along with laboratory evidence of enteroviruses infection (including EV71, CA16, or other enteroviruses), were detected using real-time RT-PCR, and these were considered &#x02018;laboratory-confirmed&#x02019; cases.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Sample collection</title><p>There are 14 cities in Guangxi, and every city has set up sentinel sites responsible for the national surveillance program for HFMD. The diagnostic criteria for HFMD were defined by the Ministry of Health.

In years with large epidemics, such as 2014, the EV71-positive rate in clinically-diagnosed HFMD was found to decrease, compared to the rates in 2010 and 2012. There was also a similar trend for years with small epidemics; specifically, the EV71-positive rate was also found to be diminished in 2015, compared to that in 2011 and 2013. The fact that the EV71-positive rate tended to diminish was observed not only in Guangxi, but also in other provinces in China, according to the report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Overall, the EV71-positive rate was reduced from 2010 to 2015, which mainly resulted from the decrease in mild cases associated with EV71 infection.</p><p>In December 2015, two inactivated EV71 vaccines, which were the first HFMD vaccines, were approved in mainland China for preventing severe HFMD [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. EV71 consists of one serotype with multiple sub-genotypes, and consequently expresses a variety of different antigens. Antibodies produced in response to an EV71 vaccine (EV71-H07, C4a strain) have been shown to cross-react with different EV71 genotypes including the B and C1&#x02013;C4 sub-genotypes [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; this should provide effective protection against HFMD caused by EV71. The epidemiological and genetic characterization of EV71 might now be affect by EV71 vaccination; therefore, there is still a need to monitor EV71 sequence variations to evaluate the genetic effects that occur after EV71 vaccination. The EV71 vaccine has been available in Guangxi since 2016. However, its relatively high cost, incurred by the recipients, has contributed to a low vaccine coverage level in Guangxi. EV71 was always the predominant pathogen for severe and fatal cases from 2010 to 2015. Thus, the EV71 vaccine is necessary across the province to abate disease burden. We suggest that EV71 vaccination should be prioritized in four cities with relatively high incidences of EV71 infection (Nanning, Qinzhou, Hechi, and Hezhou).</p><p>We predict that positive rates of non-EV71 and CA16 enterovirus such as CA6 and CA10 would be increased in mild cases in Guangxi from 2010 to 2015. For this, the results will be analyzed in a further study. It is now important to extend this pathogen detection to several other enteroviruses such as CA6 and CA10. Thus, these data suggest that HFMD pathogens other than EV71 are becoming more prevalent, and this fact should receive more attention.</p><p>In this study, we found that the EV71-positive rates for HFMD among 14 cities in Guangxi differed among cities each year. Regardless of large epidemic (2010, 2012, and 2014) or small epidemic (2011, 2013, and 2015) years, cities with the highest EV71-positive rates were not the same from year-to-year. One possible reason for this is that antibodies produced after EV71 infection might protect people from re-infection.</p><p>From 2010 to 2015, EV71 was one of the most important pathogens that caused HFMD in 14 Guangxi cities, with the exception of Fangchenggang city. Interestingly, we found that Fangchenggang always had the lowest EV71-positive rate from 2010 to 2015. Although it had a high incidence of HFMD, there was a low number of severe and fatal cases during this 6-year period. The EV71-positive rate was highest for fatal cases, which was followed by severe cases, and this was lowest in mild cases, which is consistent with previous results found in Henan and Hunan provinces [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The EV71-positive rate for mild cases in Fangchenggang was similar to that for mild cases in 13 cities. Thus, it appears that the few severe and fatal cases might be associated with a low EV71-positive rate in Fangchenggang; however, the reasons for this phenomenon require further exploration.</p><p>In China, the nationwide transmission of HFMD was reported to be associated with the relative humidity, birth rate, and population density. With respect to the latter, an interaction between the log of the population density and the Health System Performance has been observed using a multiple linear regression model [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although it has a lower population density, Guangxi has relatively higher humidity and lower Health System Performance, which might facilitate the transmission of HFMD. However, we found four cities (Fangchenggang, Baise, Chongzuoin, and Gulin) that had a relatively low EV71 rate in HFMD from 2010 to 2015. The possible reasons for this might be related to the fact that that they had low levels of rainfall, a lower population density, and a lower temperature, compared to those in other cities in Guangxi.</p><p>In recent years, the EV71-C4 sub-genotype has been the major type of EV71 found in epidemics in mainland China. This subtype can be further divided into the C4b and C4a evolutionary branches, which correspond to two time periods [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The C4b evolutionary branch contains strains from Shenzhen and Shanghai, 1998&#x02013;2004, and C4a has been identified in mainland China since 2003 [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene showed that the EV71 strains sequenced in this study all belong to C4a, with most of them exhibiting higher identity to strains circulating in southern China (especially in Fujian and Guangdong provinces) than to strains in northern China. Moreover, the predominant circulating EV71 strains in Guangxi collected from 2012 to 2015 were phylogenetically distinct from the strains collected from China before 2008.</p><p>Interestingly, one strain, 207&#x02013;3, which was isolated in 2012, was similar to Vietnamese strains isolated in 2011&#x02013;2012. There is also a reference strain, HCM120/VNM/2011, isolated in Vietnam, which forms a closely-related cluster with mainland China strains. There is strong phylogenetic support suggesting that this lineage was likely derived from strains circulating in China in 2010, as has previously been described [<xref rid="pone.0188640.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, these data suggest that a close interaction occurs between China and neighboring Vietnam.</p><p>Only a small number of EV71-positive HFMD specimens collected from Nanning city were used for cell culture and genetic analysis, but an EV71 stain was found to cluster with Vietnamese strains, suggesting that there is high risk of EV71 introduction from neighboring counties. Thus, surveillance of HFMD pathogens and the genetic analysis of the EV71 stain should be expanded in the three border cities (Chongzuo, Baise and Fangchenggang) of Guangxi, even though these were all associated with low EV71 infection rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188640.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>GenBank accession numbers for the <italic>human enterovirus 71</italic> (EV71) sequences obtained in this study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188640.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Zhigang Zheng and Hong Wang for their assistance in the statistical analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0188640.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Solomon</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lewthwaite</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Perera</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cardosa</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>McMinn</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ooi</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name>. <article-title>Virology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and control of enterovirus 71</article-title>. <source>Lancet Infect Dis</source>
