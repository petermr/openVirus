Detailed patterns of spread remain elusive, however, due to lack of granular disease data. Here we model high-volume city-level medical claims data and human mobility proxies to explore the drivers of influenza spread in the US during 2002&#x02013;2010. Although the speed and pathways of spread varied across seasons, seven of eight epidemics likely originated in the Southern US. Each epidemic was associated with 1&#x02013;5 early long-range transmission events, half of which sparked onward transmission. Gravity model estimates indicate a sharp decay in influenza transmission with the distance between infectious and susceptible cities, consistent with spread dominated by work commutes rather than air traffic. Two early-onset seasons associated with antigenic novelty had particularly localized modes of spread, suggesting that novel strains may spread in a more localized fashion than previously anticipated.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The underlying mechanisms dictating the spatial spread of seasonal influenza remain poorly understood, in part because of the lack of spatially resolved disease data to quantify patterns of spread. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing fine-grain insurance claims data on influenza-like-illnesses over eight seasons in ~300 locations throughout the United States. Using statistical methods, we found that seven of eight epidemics likely originated in the Southern US, that influenza spatial transmission is dominated by local traffic between cities, and that seasons marked by novel influenza virus circulation had a particularly radial, localized spatial structure. These findings are in stark contrast to prevailing theories of influenza spatial transmission that suggest that transmission is favored in low humidity environments and that spread is a dominated by air traffic between populous hubs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>We acknowledge financial support from the in-house research program of the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, The Fogarty International Center, US National Institutes of Health, funded in part by the Office of Pandemics and Emerging Threats at the United States Department of Health and Human Services (CV, VC, LS, BTG).

Seasonal influenza offers a unique opportunity to study the spatial diffusion of a directly transmitted pathogen in partially immune populations due the yearly invasion, extinction and subsequent re-invasion of viral strains in the northern and southern hemispheres [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Detailed characterization of the underlying mechanisms of spread has, however, been hindered by lack of spatially resolved incidence data spanning multiple seasons [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>A number of studies have explored the roles of human mobility, demography, and environmental factors in the spread of seasonal influenza on global and regional scales. These studies have suggested the following &#x0201c;principles&#x0201d;: (i) at a global scale, the worldwide air transportation network serves as the predominant channel for the dissemination of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses, A/H3N2 viruses in particular [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; (ii) at the regional scale of the US, short-distance work commutes are a major driver of the spread of seasonal outbreaks, though longer-range air traffic has been implicated as well [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; (iii) influenza is marked by rapid, hierarchical spread between populous centers followed by subsequent spread to less populated areas [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; (iv) low-humidity environments favor viral stability and thus transmission of influenza [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These sometimes-conflicting findings highlight the complexity of influenza spatial transmission across geographic scales [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and indicate that more detailed analyses are necessary to deepen our understanding of the drivers of spread.</p><p>Though rare, influenza pandemics offer valuable opportunities to study the dissemination of an invasion wave in a susceptible population, with higher than usual attack rates and intensified data collection efforts. Previous work has indicated that gravity models [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] can provide parsimonious descriptions of the spatial diffusion process of pandemic waves, particularly for the 1918 pandemic in England and Wales [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the 2009 A/H1N1pdm pandemic in the US [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These models describe the pairwise spatial interaction between communities as a function of population size and distance, each tuned by power-law parameters. A previous analysis of the 2009 pandemic across the continental US revealed a surprisingly local and radially diffusive wave of spread originating in the Southeastern US [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The observed pandemic trajectory ran contrary to the prediction of fast hierarchal invasion among populous and interconnected locales followed by slower &#x0201c;in-filling&#x0201d; of the interspersed smaller communities. We currently have no guiding principles for when or whether we should expect such a localized mode of spread for seasonal epidemics since there are substantial differences in both the age-groups infected and in population-level immunity during epidemic v. pandemic seasons [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Further, prior work has indicated that global and regional patterns of influenza spread and viral persistence differ by subtype, perhaps mediated by differenced in immunity [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Within a subtype, prior exposure history and antigenic changes may render specific age-strata differentially immune to the particular viral strain in circulation, in turn affecting patterns of spread. In the absence of a full understanding of the interplay between prior immunity and disease dissemination, mobility studies and simulation models must be validated with real-world incidence data.</p><p>Here, we present a detailed analysis of influenza spread between US cities by modeling a unique set of geo-referenced time series of influenza-like illnesses generated from a large-volume compilation of outpatient medical insurance claims across the US, spanning 8 influenza seasons. Our analysis provides the first detailed characterization of seasonal influenza spread across the continental US and its relation to subtype-differences in susceptibility/contagiousness, human mobility and environmental factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>Our analysis builds on earlier work indicating that city-level medical insurance claims of influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) are useful and specific indicators of influenza virus activity across the US [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We extend previous analyses of the autumn wave of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to study spatial spread among 310 distinct geo-referenced locations across continental US during the 2002/03 through 2009/10 influenza seasons, covering both mild and severe epidemics as well as the 2009 pandemic (<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A1). Our spatial analysis relies on estimates of local influenza onsets, defined as the date associated with the winter breakpoint in ILI incidence for each location in each season (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g001">Fig 1</xref> and supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Fig A1). Depending on the strength of the influenza signal, we were able to accurately estimate the onset times in 135&#x02013;306 locations in each season (<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). First, we characterize the timing, origin, trajectory, spatial synchrony and long-range transmission events of each of the 8 epidemics.

Parameter estimates for external seeding, <italic>&#x003c1;</italic>, varied several orders of magnitude between seasons, from ~0 in the 2005/2006 season to 0.98 in the 2004/2005 season.

The large heterogeneity in estimates of <italic>&#x003c1;</italic> across seasons highlights the variable nature of long-distance transmission events in seeding epidemics during the seasons studied.</p><p>Spatial models based on geographic-distance outperformed those integrating mobility-indices in all seasons except for 2006/2007, where the work commutes-based model fit marginally better (<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Models incorporating work commutes systematically outperformed those using air traffic (<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, see also supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A5 for a comparison of connectivity between the two mobility proxies). Model estimates suggest that the risk of influenza transmission scales with work commutes according to a power law exponent between 0.6&#x02013;0.8 (median = 0.67, <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To better understand the differences between the models considered here, we explored the relationships between work commutes, air traffic and geographic distance (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A6). We found that work commutes tend to be more localized than influenza transmission (distance power-laws of ~3.3 for work commutes and ~2.2 for influenza transmission, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g006">Fig 6</xref>), while air traffic did not scale with geographic distance (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A6). Models relying on mobility proxies did not indicate a strong role for population size (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>) (<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the importance of the normalization parameter (<italic>&#x003f5;</italic>) is seen across all models, as estimates were generally close to 1 and always excluded 0 (<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This provides support for a density-independent infectious process, at least at the level of sampling in this dataset. For illustration, a map of the normalization effect indicates that a density-dependent transmission model (<italic>&#x003b5;</italic> = 0) would tend to under-estimate influenza risk in cities with few close neighbors (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A7). In other words, under the current sampling scheme, the least connected cities, generally located in the central part of the US, have a stronger risk of infection than their neighborhood alone would predict in the absence of normalization.</p><p>Finally, we also considered more complex models incorporating other demographic variables (population size of the infectious locations) and climatic information (absolute humidity in susceptible locations), but none of these factors provided substantial improvements to the model fit (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A3). Sensitivity analyses revealed that parameter estimates were robust to the inclusion of measurements errors in onset times (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A13), and were comparable to those estimated under a fully-specified likelihood (instead of the partial likelihood used here) (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A4). These analyses also revealed that the risk of influenza infection can vary substantially over the time-course of an epidemic (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A5, Figures A8 and A9). In further sensitivity analyses, we refit the semi-parametric models constraining the highly-variable external seeding term <italic>&#x003c1;</italic> to 0. Under this nested model, estimates of the distance exponent <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> were largest in the 2003/2004, 2005/2006 seasons and the 2009 pandemic, aligning with patterns of localized spread observed in maps of epidemic onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and synchrony analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g004">Fig 4</xref>; supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A8).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Discussion</title><p>Informed disease control and pandemic planning rely on understanding the mechanisms of and variability in the spatial transmission of influenza.

The estimated risk of transmission decays sharply with geographic distance from an infected location according to a power-law of ~2.2 (Range: 2.1&#x02013;2.7). A particularly localized, radial spatial structure was observed in the 2003/2004 and 2005/2006 epidemics dominated by A/H3N2 viruses and, as reported previously [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic dominated by A/H1N1pdm. We extended previous models of influenza transmission by explicitly connecting disease data with human mobility proxies and found that models driven by geographic distance or work commutes systematically outperformed those driven by air traffic. Taken together, these results do not support domestic air traffic as the dominant mode of spatial dissemination of influenza in the US.</p><p>We identified between one and five long-range transmission events per season, most occurring in the first third of each epidemic and half contributing successfully to the observed dynamics via secondary onward transmission. In model-based analyses, the estimated effect of external seeding varied more than 10-fold across seasons. Whether domestic or international air traffic is responsible for these long-range events and the initial seeding of the epidemic is an important area for future research, which would benefit from complementary analysis of phylogenetic data [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Previous work has indicated that work commutes are an important driver of the inter-state spread of influenza in the US [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; here we show that at the scale of cities, models utilizing geographic distance outperformed those using work commutes. The range of connectivity implied by the work commute data may be too narrow to accurately capture influenza transmission, which occurs on a broader spatial scale, likely contributing to the better fit of distance-based spatial models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Further differences in model fit may stem from the substantially higher degree distribution of the geographic distance network compared to the between-city work-commute network, thereby allowing many more possible pathways for epidemic spread in distance-based models (see supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A5). Reassuringly, however, there was excellent internal consistency between parameter estimates for the work commute and distance-based models (see supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Demography and the spatial spread of influenza</title><p>Prior work has indicated that influenza spread at the state-level in the US is dominated by hierarchical spread between populous states (perhaps driven by inter-state work commutes) [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but this work was limited by low-resolution (state-level) mortality data and patterns were averaged across several decades. Our model-based analysis of higher resolution outpatient ILI visits indicates that while more populated locations are at relatively higher risk for influenza transmission compared to less populous locations, this effect is not strong enough for hierarchical spread to predominate over local spread. Indeed, a susceptible city&#x02019;s population size contributed only marginally to its risk of obtaining influenza early in an epidemic. It is important to note that this estimated relationship may be confounded by differences in the age-structures of large and small populations, which are not accounted for in our model. In a supplementary analysis (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A14) we demonstrate that more populous counties are enriched with persons between 20 and 50 years of age, a segment of the population with presumably higher rates of travel (both local and long-distance). Enrichment for this segment of the population in larger counties may confound the relationship between the risk of influenza infection and population size.</p><p>In complementary analyses, we estimated spatial synchrony in ILI data using the approach proposed in Viboud et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], both at the original resolution of cities and with data aggregated at the state-level. This sensitivity analysis suggests that the effects of workflows and demography are more pronounced at the state-level than at the city-level, validating earlier results [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A6, Figures A10, A11). In contrast, the relationship between synchrony and geographic distance predominates at the scale of cities, indicating that spatial data aggregation likely biases the precise characterization of disease spread. The availability of finely spatially-resolved disease data is therefore essential to accurately capture the mechanisms of disease dissemination [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Absolute humidity and the spatial spread of influenza</title><p>In contrast to previous work [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], our analysis did not find that absolute humidity was an important driver of the spatial spread of influenza. Absolute humidity did not affect the susceptibility of individual cities to influenza infection (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A3), though our models did not allow for spatial variation in the effect of absolute humidity. This finding is consistent with prior studies of the 2009 pandemic in the US [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Europe [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, our analysis suggests seven of the eight epidemics studied likely originated in the Southern US, several in humid areas of Texas and Louisiana, a pattern that does not fit with the concept that low humidity favors influenza transmission [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Analyses of longer epidemiological records should shed light on whether the preferred Southern origin of epidemics is due to frequent seeding of influenza in the Southern US (potentially from Central and South America), or if demographic or geographic conditions favor early influenza activity in the South. Importantly, our study did not address the potential role of environmental factors on the local dynamics of influenza, particularly in the weeks immediately following the estimated onset times in each city.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Schools and the spatial spread of influenza</title><p>Prior work on the 2009 pandemic has indicated a role for school openings in modulating the spatial structure of influenza spread during that season [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This was especially important in 2009 because (1) influenza transmission in the US occurred much earlier in the year (August-October) than for seasonal outbreaks, coinciding with the start of the fall school term, and (2) there is substantial geographic variation across start dates for US school fall terms, with earliest school openings in the Southeastern US. In contrast, seasonal influenza outbreaks tend to occur later in the year (onset dates Oct-Jan), typically well into the school fall term. While it is possible that the Christmas holiday break may modulate spatiotemporal patterns in seasonal influenza spread, the timing of this break is more uniform across the US and is not as likely to contribute to spatial variation in spread.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Effect of antigenic novelty on spatial spread of influenza</title><p>Given the great interest in predicting how a novel influenza virus will spread through a largely susceptible population, two high transmission seasons merit special attention: the 2003/2004 drift-variant A/H3N2 epidemic and the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic (previously studied in [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Yang et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed that the pre-season population-level susceptibility (~70%), effective reproductive number (1.4&#x02013;1.6), and overall attack rates (24&#x02013;33%) were similar for these two major influenza seasons, and in the higher range of seasonal influenza epidemics. We found that in both seasons, influenza virus circulation originated in the Southern US and began earlier in the year than is typical. The relatively slow spread (9&#x02013;12 weeks) and strong spatial signature of these two seasons is surprising because theory suggests that more transmissible influenza viruses, associated with higher effective reproduction numbers, should spread faster and less radially (because long-distance introductions are more likely) than less transmissible viruses [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The net spatial effect of increased transmissibility is likely modulated by the mobility patterns of the most susceptible hosts, which may vary substantially with age and across seasons.</p><p>Though a satisfying explanation for these findings remains elusive, the spatial diffusion of novel influenza viruses appears more localized than previously speculated and multiple introductions of influenza may be required to seed an epidemic in any given city, as the probability that a single introduction sparks an epidemic is low. Because commuting flows are on average one order of magnitude larger than air traffic volume [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], predominantly localized transmission is consistent with the idea that local connectivity (which includes work commutes) is the main driver of epidemic spread [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Finally, this finding may also highlight the importance of children in spreading influenza over short distances, an age group that also tends to be disproportionately impacted during times of novel influenza virus circulation [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>We have not considered the role of human behavior change in shaping the spatiotemporal dynamics of epidemics [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but we anticipate that the perception of risk during seasonal influenza epidemics is relatively consistent across seasons, and suspect this may play only a minor role in modulating spatial spread. During the 2009 pandemic, the US experienced a widely publicized &#x0201c;herald wave&#x0201d; of H1N1pdm transmission during the spring. By the fall, the US population was broadly aware that H1N1pdm infection was generally mild, likely reducing reactive behavior change during the fall wave of the pandemic. In our study, we model influenza epidemic onset times, rather than the full epidemic dynamics in each location, and is thus our approach is less sensitive to reactive behavior changes in response to growing case counts near the peak of the outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Modeling strategies and future developments</title><p>Numerous strategies exist for modeling epidemic spread. Inspired by previous work on the foot-and mouth-disease epidemic in the UK [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we employed semi-parametric transmission models to quantify the risk of infection as a function of demographic factors and different distance metrics across several seasons. Previous studies have used fully parametric models and have focused on a single epidemic with the goal of capturing the entire epidemic process [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We found that fully parametric models often require time-varying baseline hazards to capture the temporal dynamics of influenza epidemics (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A5, Figures A8 and A9). Accordingly, a constant baseline hazard was unable to fully capture the temporal dynamics of the 1918 epidemic, with model-predicted onsets times occurring earlier on average than observations [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For the 2009 pandemic, information on school openings was necessary to allow the baseline hazard for transmission to change over time (and space) [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this context, the partial likelihood method [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] provides clear advantages in obtaining robust estimates for key spatial covariates while obviating the need to specify the form of the time-varying baseline hazard. In sensitivity analyses, we found that parameter estimates for the spatial component of the model were robust to the choice of baseline hazard in fully-parametric model formulations (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A4). One disadvantage of the semi-parametric method, however, is that it does not allow simulations of epidemic trajectories over time and cannot be applied for real-time predictions, as the baseline hazard is not fully specified.</p><p>Our study is subject to several limitations. First, and most importantly, our study was limited to eight seasons, making our conclusions difficult to generalize broadly given year-to-year variability in circulating influenza strains. Second, although ~80% of the US population was eventually captured in this dataset, this percentage was lower in earlier years of data collection, and the Midwestern US was geographically under-sampled. Third, our analysis relies critically on the accurate estimation of epidemic onsets in each location, which is particularly challenging during mild epidemics because the influenza signal is weaker. To address this issue, we (1) analyzed data only from locations with sufficiently robust influenza signals, (2) quantified the uncertainty in epidemic onset estimates, and (3) computed onset times using more &#x0201c;traditional&#x0201d; methods (sinusoidal regression models), which showed excellent agreement with our estimates (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A12). Further, we have shown that the main results of our study are robust to moderate uncertainties in the epidemic onset times (supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A13). Fourth, our dataset is based on ILI records rather than laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. Though outpatient ILI captures the aggregate effects of a number of respiratory pathogens, previous work has shown strong agreement with laboratory-based indicators of influenza virus activity at the regional and city level [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, our analysis is focused on influenza epidemic onset times, which are identified using a linear-spline method separating background ILI rates from rapid case growth due to influenza activity. This approach controls for the effect of other respiratory pathogens in the peri-epidemic period.</p><p>Another caveat relates to the co-circulation of several influenza virus subtypes or strains in some winters. Syndromic (ILI) time series capture the aggregate effects of these viruses, making it challenging to disentangle the transmission dynamics of one virus from another. We speculate, however, that co-circulation would superpose multiple spatial patterns thereby biasing analyses towards spatial randomness; reassuringly, we observed a spatial signature during epidemics in which multiple subtypes co-circulated (2002/2003, 2004/2005, and 2005/2006). Importantly, this caveat does not apply to the severe and radially diffusive influenza seasons in 2003/2004 and 2009, which were marked by overwhelming predominance of a single antigenically-novel strain.</p><p>We relied on gravity-type power-law models of influenza transmission and incorporated empirical data on human mobility; these models have been validated as parsimonious approximations of both human movement [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and influenza spread [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A major limitation of these models, however, is that they consider the pairwise interaction between infectious/susceptible cities, but ignore higher order interactions, which may prove to be essential in capturing realistic patterns of human movement. In reality, some combination of work commutes, air travel and other local movements likely drive disease dissemination, and ideally these different connectivity metrics should be integrated in a single model rather than analyzed separately. Because the observed mobility networks are captured on different scales both geographically and temporally, it is not clear how best to combine information across such different networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Finally, the observed data represent a sample of locations within the network of interacting cities; the effects of geographic sampling on parameter estimation is poorly understood. Further work is needed to develop realistic model formulations that connect multiple mobility indices and disease datasets at appropriate temporal and spatial scales.</p><p>In line with previous work on the spatial spread of influenza [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] our analysis focuses on epidemic establishment in each location under study, rather than the time of influenza introduction. Epidemic establishment is more complex than the mere importation of influenza cases, as it requires sustained chains of local transmission, which may depend on climatic or virus-specific factors, among others. In our study, the unit of analysis is the city, and only after establishment of sustained local transmission in each city are there sufficient numbers of cases to allow for influenza spread to other cities, as built into the model framework utilized here. The frequency of viral introductions and specific viral migration pathways would be interesting to study but are best addressed by phylogeographic analyses, assuming appropriate sampling of viral sequences early in the epidemic [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza across eight seasons using granular surveillance data provides several new insights into how geography, human mobility and immunity intermesh to shape the dissemination of influenza in the US. Spatial dissemination is radial and localized, with domestic air traffic playing little role. Intriguingly, epidemics have a propensity to begin in the Southern US, a finding contradictory to existing concepts of environmental forcing on influenza transmission [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Two seasons marked by the circulation of novel viruses (2003/2004 epidemic and the 2009 pandemic) were unique in that influenza arrived earlier in the year than is typical and patterns of spread were particularly localized and radial. Novel influenza viruses appear to spread more locally than previously speculated, perhaps driven by a younger mean age at infection and in turn a decrease in the range of mobility of susceptible hosts. Most importantly perhaps, our work points to a need for highly granular epidemiological datasets to deepen our understanding of influenza transmission, beyond the data resolution available from traditional surveillance schemes. Moving forward, validation of our findings using longer epidemiological records and pathogen genetic information at the same spatial scale will be essential [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Further work should also concentrate on the importance of data resolution, antigenic novelty, and age-specific differences in prior immunity on spatial transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Epidemiological data</title><p>We compiled weekly time series of influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) from 2002&#x02013;2010 under a collaborative research agreement with IMS Health, a private data and analytics company that collects de-identified CMS-1500 electronic medical claims from outpatient physician visits throughout the US. The system covered 61.5% of US physicians in 2009 [<xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Specifically, for each location and season, we computed the difference between the maximum ILI incidence and the maximum ILI incidence in the first 10 weeks of the season (before influenza circulation). We generated an empirical distribution of this statistic across seasons and locations, and excluded locations if their observed statistic fell in the bottom 20<sup>th</sup> percentile of this distribution.

In this case, we obtained a single epidemic onset for the six counties by taking the inverse-variance weighted average of epidemic onsets in the cities matched to those counties.
