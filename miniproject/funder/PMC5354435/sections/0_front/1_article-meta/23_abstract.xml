 <p>Dengue fever is an important public health problem in China, and its importance was highlighted by an unprecedented outbreak in Guangdong province in 2014. Several previous studies have found that prediction models based on internet-based data have advantages in the timely detection of dengue epidemics. In this study, we employed the Dengue Baidu Search Index (DBSI) to explore whether internet-based query data can help improve disease prediction. We found that the dengue early warning system combining DBSI with traditional surveillance and meteorological data improved the prediction capability in Guangzhou, which suggests that utilizing big data from internet search engines can provide valuable supplementary data to traditional surveillance systems particularly for developing dengue early warning systems.</p>
