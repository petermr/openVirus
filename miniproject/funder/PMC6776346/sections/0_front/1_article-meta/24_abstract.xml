 <p>Zika can be characterized as one of the most significant emerging arboviruses. The Zika epidemic in Brazil and the subsequent increase in the number of serious brain anomalies, such as microcephaly, has demonstrated the importance of analysing the impact of Zika infection on the rate of congenital anomalies in an affected population. From the analysis of the monthly data on the Live Birth Information System, the authors found that immediately after the Zika event there was a large increase in the notification rate of congenital anomalies reported as a complication of which infection (malformations of brain and eye) and also an increase in the rate of congenital malformations not related with Zika. This growth was seen throughout the country as a whole and in all regions (except in the South), especially in the Northeast where the infection rates were the highest. In the period post-Zika event, the group not related with brain or eye malformation there was an increase in the monthly notification rate while in the brain and eye group there was a decrease in the monthly notification rate. These findings suggest an overall growing awareness of health professionals to improve the registration of birth malformations trigged by the Zika epidemic.</p>
