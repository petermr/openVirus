 <p>Larvicides are a key tool to prevent the growth of mosquito populations and decrease both the risks of outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases and the nuisance deriving from bites. In order to assist municipalities from temperate areas in Europe in effectively planning vector control programs, we modelled the effect of larviciding in public areas on populations of 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> using mosquito collection data from 10 municipalities in Northern Italy, over two years with very different temperature conditions. We then evaluated the resulting probabilities of potential outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue and their expected final sizes, and we compared the intervention costs to the economic and health benefits due to the avoidance of clinical cases. By assessing several different intervention strategies, we found that the optimal timing should be centred on the month of July, corresponding to the period of maximal growth of the mosquito population. Municipality-wide interventions are likely to be cost-effective in small-to-medium towns (below 35,000 inhabitants) even where mosquito infestation is moderate, whereas for larger cities a neighbourhood-based intervention should be considered. The involvement of citizens to apply larvicides within private premises resulted effective but generally too costly.
