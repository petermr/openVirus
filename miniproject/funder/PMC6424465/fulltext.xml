We propose a method for generating spatial fields with controllable levels of clustering of the population. We build a synthetic country, and use this method to generate versions of the country with different clustering levels. Combined with a metapopulation model for infectious disease spread, this allows us to in silico explore how urbanisation affects infectious disease spread. In a baseline scenario with no interventions, the underlying population clustering seems to have little effect on the final size and timing of the epidemic. Under within-country restrictions on non-commuting travel, the final size decreases with increased population clustering. The effect of travel restrictions on reducing the final size is larger with higher clustering. The reduction is larger in the more rural areas. Within-country travel restrictions delay the epidemic, and the delay is largest for lower clustering levels. We implemented three different vaccination strategies&#x02014;uniform vaccination (in space), preferentially vaccinating urban locations and preferentially vaccinating rural locations. The urban and uniform vaccination strategies were most effective in reducing the final size, while the rural vaccination strategy was clearly inferior. Visual inspection of some European countries shows that many countries already have high population clustering. In the future, they will likely become even more clustered. Hence, according to our model, within-country travel restrictions are likely to be less and less effective in delaying epidemics, while they will be more effective in decreasing final sizes. In addition, to minimise final sizes, it is important not to neglect urban locations when distributing vaccines. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the effect of urbanisation on infectious disease spread and in particular, to examine effectiveness of prevention measures as a function of urbanisation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>We study the interplay between urbanisation and infectious disease spread. As part of the worldwide urbanisation process, people are continuously moving to urban areas, and the cities are growing in size. This causes clusters of areas with high population density and clusters of areas with low population density, which is what we call population clustering. By simulating infectious disease spread in a synthetic country where we vary this population clustering, we explore the consequences of urbanisation on infectious disease spread. Our qualitative results have direct implications for infectious disease control guidelines and policies. We find that implementing internal travel restrictions have greater impact on the final number ill in the most urbanised countries than in the less urbanised countries. The effect is largest in the more rural parts of the country. According to our model, travel restrictions are more effective in delaying the epidemic in the less urbanised countries than in the more urbanised countries. We investigate vaccination strategies, where locations are targeted depending on how urban or rural they are. We find that it is important to vaccinate the urban locations&#x02014;if the most urban locations are not covered by the vaccine, the final number ill will be a lot larger.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>SE and AF acknowledge partial funding from the Norwegian Research Council centre BigInsight project 237718.

From a United Nations report [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], we know that in 2014, 54% of the population was living in urban areas. By 2050, they estimate that 66% of the population will be living in urban areas. The number of &#x0201c;megacities&#x0201d; is also increasing [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Urbanisation involves clustering of people within a geographical area [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Migration from rural to urban areas is one of the key drivers of urbanisation, and results in spatial expansion of urban centers [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Though there are also other characteristics of urbanisation, like urban sprawl [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and population growth, we here focus on this population clustering. By population clustering, we mean that large cities are often surrounded by other cities or suburbs with large population sizes. Rural areas also tend to appear in clusters (i.e. positioned closely together). This has for instance been found to be the case for the Turku region in Finland, where regions of both high and low population densities are clustered [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Another example is Australia, where the majority of the population is clustered around the coastal belt [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. From here on, the term urbanisation will be used to refer to the population clustering.</p><p>We aim at studying the urbanisation phenomenon and its effect on infectious disease spread in a general setting. Our purpose is not to describe single outbreaks in specific populations, or finding the &#x0201c;best model&#x0201d; or strategy for a specific country, but rather study the phenomenon from a more generic and principled point of view.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the effect of internal travel restrictions and vaccination on infectious disease spread, when the clustering of population is continuously varied. By internal travel restrictions, we will refer to restrictions on non-commuting travel within the country. If the disease dynamics is different for different levels of population clustering, this can have important implications for the effectiveness and design of interventions. In order to study this, we need a continuous series of countries where everything is fixed, apart from the urbanisation, which changes between the countries in a controllable and continuous manner. This is difficult in practice, and we therefore construct a fictional country for this purpose, however trying to maintain some realism. Our aim is not to develop a precise model for urbanisation in a country. We aim for a simple model, where urbanisation is controlled by one single tuning parameter, which captures key features of urbanisation. We use this model to generate a fictional country with a plausible population distributed in urban and rural areas. More specifically, we use a plausible population size distribution, plausible commuting patterns modelled by a gravity law and a plausible infectious disease model. We use a metapopulation infectious disease model, where an SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) process [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] governs the disease dynamics in each location, and the different locations are coupled through individuals travelling between them. This framework allows us to investigate in silico how urbanisation affects various aspects of infectious disease spread. As a motivating example, we will study an influenza-like illness spreading in a single country, where we assume that the pathogen has already been imported to the country. We investigate how the infectious disease dynamics depends on the underlying population clustering in the country and focus on the effect of internal travel restrictions and three different vaccination strategies.</p><p>The plausibility of the synthetic country is obtained by conserving the population size distribution of Norway and a gravity law fitted to data on commuting between Norwegian municipalities. We use Norwegian data to ensure reasonable population sizes, and plausible commuting for those population sizes, and because we have commuting data available on a relatively fine spatial scale. We are studying the urbanisation phenomenon generically, and we do not claim, nor is it our aim, that these results are directly applicable to Norway. This framework is a simulator, and it is not our purpose to model and provide results for a specific country. Our results allow a theoretical description of how urbanisation affects interventions to control epidemics.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first modelling and simulation study which systematically investigates the effect of population clustering on the spread of infectious diseases. In particular, it is the first study to consider the effect of internal travel restrictions and vaccination in relation to urbanisation. This is a study of the urbanisation phenomenon represented in a very simplified and theoretical way, yet with important elements of realism. We focus on these two control strategies, because they are clearly affected by urbanisation. We do not consider international air travel restrictions, school closure or other sanitary measures, which were used for instance during the 2009 pandemic [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Travel restrictions have a long history, and date back at least to the 14th century, where people were prevented from leaving or entering specific communities during the plague epidemics [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Travel bans were also used in many cities and countries during the 1918-1919 influenza epidemic [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More recently, internal travel restrictions were used as a mitigation measure against influenza virus transmission during the 2009 pandemic in Mongolia, through interruption of provincial rail and road travel [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and during the recent Ebola outbreaks [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There has been some work on infectious disease spread and urbanisation focussing on the improved health conditions in urban areas compared to rural areas. For the developed countries, health has overall improved with increased urbanisation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In low-income settings, health conditions are on average better in urban areas than in rural areas, but there are also significant challenges relating to inequities and heterogeneity in health among the urban population (favelas, slums, etc.). High population density increases exposure to infectious diseases [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Africa, the urban population has better nutritional status, fewer morbid events, increased vaccine coverage and better access to healthcare services compared to the rural population, and have reduced levels of malaria transmission and other severe diseases [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There is also one study, [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which develops a model for the effect of urbanisation on the transmission of infectious diseases, focussing on population growth and land use development. However, the infectious disease spread model is very simple. In addition, they do not consider the effect of interventions.</p><p>The effectiveness of both vaccination and internal travel restrictions on mitigating an infectious disease have been studied in various settings, e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Germann et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] study the spread of a hypothetical pandemic influenza, with a basic reproductive number in the range 1.6-2.4, in the United States, and find that (domestic) travel restrictions do not have an effect on the final size of the epidemic, but might be able to slightly delay the time course. They also find that vaccination drastically reduces the final number of cases and delays the spread. Ferguson et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] find that reducing long distance travel within the United States (domestic air travel) only slightly delays the influenza epidemic, for a hypothetical pandemic influenza strain with varying transmissibility. They consider vaccination in both the United Kingdom and the United States, and find that vaccination significantly reduces the final size of the epidemic. In accordance with these studies, the US Department of Health and Human Services also claims that vaccination is the most effective way of preventing the public health impact of (pandemic) influenza [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In a review study, Mateus et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] find that domestic travel restrictions can delay the influenza epidemics by one week, and that extensive travel restrictions can reduce the final size of the epidemic. Both seasonal and pandemic influenza strains are considered. They also find that travel restrictions have minimal impact in urban centers with dense population and high mobility. Brownstein et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] consider the influenza epidemic following the travel ban after 9/11. They claim that the decrease in air traffic in the United States caused a delayed and prolonged influenza season (however, note also the rebuttal in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). For a hypothetical influenza strain in Korea, it was found that 50% internal travel restrictions delayed the peak timing and had a slight reduction effect on the peak [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Some work has also been done on mathematical explanations and expressions for delay in epidemic spreading due to travel restrictions, for border control on international travel [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and for more general mobility networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>During the 2009 influenza pandemic, uniform vaccination guidelines were given (i.e. pro rata), for instance in Norway [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Ireland [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the United States [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the default vaccination strategies are usually uniform [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of the different vaccination strategies and which strategy is best in terms of minimising attack rate, possibly depend on the population clustering of the underlying country. We thus simulate the epidemic with three different vaccination strategies&#x02014;uniform vaccination, prioritising urban locations and prioritising rural locations. This allows us to compare the three vaccination strategies as a function of population clustering and provides us with a better understanding and possibilities for refined vaccination strategies. There are numerous examples of spatially targeted vaccination and antiviral strategies in the literature [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Some of these are based on dynamic optimisation strategies [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], while others are based on prioritising locations with high prevalence (i.e. geographically targeting hotspots) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], pro rata vaccination strategies are compared to vaccination strategies prioritising locations sequentially by population size (among other vaccination strategies). This is similar to the vaccination strategy we investigate, targeting urban and/or rural locations.</p><p>We investigate how domestic travel restrictions and vaccination affects the epidemic timing, spread and final size for the various levels of population clustering. For policy planners, the timing of peak dates and initial dates are important because they indicate how much time there is to implement interventions and preventive measures. If peak dates for spatially proximate regions are close in time, the efficiency of the health care organisation is challenged. This is extra problematic if there is in addition clustering of high peak incidences, since that would imply that spatially proximate locations have high disease activity at the same time. We further disentangle the effect of travel restrictions on final size of the epidemic by examining how the effect depends on how urban or rural the location is.</p><p>We first describe the simulation set-up with details on the properties of the fictional country, the clustering algorithm, the disease dynamics model, the travel restrictions and vaccination strategies. We then use this tool to simulate the infectious disease spread for the various levels of clustering, investigate the effect of various amounts of internal travel restrictions, simulate and investigate the effect of the three vaccination strategies and finally a combination of travel restrictions and vaccination. We end with discussion and concluding remarks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Models</title><p>In order to investigate how population clustering affects infectious disease dynamics, we build a series of countries with varying population clustering, where everything else is fixed. Imagine something like taking one country and reshuffling its population, so to increase monotonically its level of urbanisation. We construct a fictional country, where the spatial clustering of population sizes is controlled by a design parameter. However, we try to conserve some realism in the different ingredients of the framework. The realism is obtained by using a population size distribution and commuting law fitted to data from Norwegian municipalities.</p><p>In this section, the different parts of the simulation framework will be described. We first describe how to generate the geographical areas, with a plausible population distribution. We then introduce the clustering algorithm that is used to generate different versions of the geographical area, with different levels of clustering. Then we describe the models for the two (coupled) dynamical processes for the geographical areas&#x02014;the infectious disease process and the mobility process. Finally, we describe the interventions&#x02014;the internal travel restrictions and the vaccination strategies.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Generating the geographical areas</title><p>We construct a country, where the spatial clustering of population sizes is controlled by a design parameter. The country is a square, consisting of many small block units.</p><p>The construction process consists of two steps. First, we generate the population sizes in the block units of the country by drawing a random sample from a reasonable population distribution. In the second step, we apply a clustering algorithm, generating different versions of the country with various levels of clustering. The clustering is done by rearranging the block units according to a mapping rule.</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Population sizes</title><p>The block units are assigned populations which are drawn from a gamma distribution. We use 6561 block units with unit area 81 km<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a total area of approximately 530 000 km<sup>2</sup>. We rescale our resulting population sizes to sum up to 6 000 000 (slightly larger than Norway). The data are from Statistics Norway for 2016, and we use the 428 municipalities, excluding Svalbard. We use the municipality scale, because this is the finest spatial scale for which we have both population size data and commuting data. The block units can be interpreted as a discretisation of administrative units, so that multiple block units can make up one administrative unit. We do not use the population sizes in the administrative units directly, because a finer scale is necessary for the clustering algorithm to generate smooth distributions. The number of block units is chosen as a trade off between a high resolution, and computational feasibility.</p><p>We fit a gamma distribution to the logarithm of the population sizes, since the distribution is clearly very skewed. We draw random realisations from this distribution, providing reasonable population sizes in the block units. The histogram of the population size for the municipalities of Norway and the fitted distribution are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s002">S1 Fig</xref>.</p><p>We fit distributions to normalised population data from various other countries, to assess similarity across countries.

The population sizes in the Norwegian municipalities seem to be more heterogeneous than for the other countries, with a higher occurrence of smaller population sizes. The UK distribution seems most homogeneous. Noticeably, all the population distributions are skewed. Note that these administrative levels are not standardised across the different countries. Therefore comparison between countries must be treated with caution.</p><fig id="pcbi.1006879.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006879.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Population sizes.</title><p>Population size distribution for Norway, France, Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Iceland and United Kingdom, in different administrative units: 428 municipalities for Norway, 334 arrondissements for France, 107 provinces for Italy, 388 municipalities for the Netherlands, 98 municipalities for Denmark, 129 post codes for Iceland and 424 local authorities for the UK.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1006879.g001"/></fig><p>In some of the results, the locations are grouped according to population size.

The transformation that we use from the random spatial field to the resulting versions of the countries with different clustering levels is not linear, and it is thus not possible to formally estimate <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>. However, we are not aiming at providing quantitative results for specific countries, nor is our framework the best choice for that purpose. We are interested in general trends when <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> is varied, both qualitative and quantitative, in order to be able to make comparisons between different cases. However, the absolute measures (the peak dates, final sizes etc.) are not translatable to specific real settings. When a quantity like the non-infected area during an epidemic changes monotonically when the (synthetic) level of urbanisation increases, then we will hypothesise that urbanisation affects the quantity. When we do not discover a monotone effect, we will conclude that a dependency is less likely.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>The disease dynamics model</title><p>The disease dynamics model is a metapopulation model which can be described as a network where every node represents a location, and every edge between locations represents people who travel between the locations and thus can spread the disease further.

The approximation is due to the integer approximations, so we vaccinate to the nearest integer.

The remaining vaccination doses are then uniformly distributed in the other locations. In the urban vaccination strategy, we vaccinate preferentially in urban locations, by only vaccinating the 50% largest locations, using the same total number of vaccines as in the uniform vaccination setting.

The peak dates occurred earlier for increased levels of clustering, for all the travel ratios. In addition, the curves were very similar for the three travel restriction scenarios, while the peak dates occurred earlier for the baseline scenario. Hence, implementing travel restrictions delayed the epidemic peak. For the peak prevalence, we note that the higher levels of travel restrictions, the lower the peak. The decrease in peak prevalence was larger for the lower clustering levels. The decrease in peak prevalence for 99% travel restrictions compared to the baseline scenario was 38% for the highest clustering level and 48% for the lowest clustering level.

It might therefore be a more effective use of vaccines to allocate all the resources to the most urban locations, since the more rural locations are more protected from the epidemic.

The gravity law is a popular choice for modelling influenza/infectious disease spread [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and has been found to capture well spatio-temporal influenza [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and measles [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] dynamics. An alternative to the gravity law is the radiation law [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which is parameter free, and therefore claimed to be more universal. Some analytical inconsistencies of the gravity law are also pointed out in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The radiation law does not directly depend on distance, but rather on the population density between locations. The fact that the radiation law is parameter free is attractive in this setting, since we are modelling commuting in a fictional country and thus obviously do not have commuting data available for that country. However, the gravity law has been shown to have a better fit [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], especially for finer scales, which is the case in our setting. For further information on the gravity law, the radiation law, extensions of these and other mobility models, we refer to the thorough review in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We have chosen to use the gravity law in our main analysis since it had a better fit to our commuting data (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.82 versus <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.67 for the radiation law), and because it is commonly used in spatial models of infectious disease transmission. Regarding the shape of the gravity law, we have chosen to use a power function of distance, as in for instance [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Some commuting features that are not well captured by the gravity model are pointed out in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and they suggest some extensions to the gravity law for solving these issues. However, for reasons of simplicity, we have chosen to work with the more standard model. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s001">S1 Text</xref>, we perform sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the gravity law, the shape of the distance function, and we redo the analysis using a radiation law. The qualitative patterns are robust to the choice of commuting model. However, the different effect sizes varied with the shape of the commuting law. Comments on discrepancies in the effect sizes under the different scenarios are provided below.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Findings&#x02014;Discussion, robustness, implications and relation to previous literature</title><sec id="sec025"><title>Baseline scenario</title><p>In a baseline scenario (no travel restrictions, no prior immunity and no vaccination), we found that the population clustering did not play an important role in outcome measures. This finding was robust across a range of different parameter values and choices&#x02014;for a different set of disease parameters, for a fictional country based on a UK gravity law and population distribution, when varying the length of stay for the long distance travellers, when varying the shape and parameters of the gravity law and when modelling the commuting with a radiation law.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Travel restrictions</title><p><italic><bold>Final size</bold></italic>. In contrast with the baseline scenario, population clustering had an effect on the outcome measures under travel restrictions. Most importantly, the final size decreased with increased clustering. The effect of travel restrictions on decreasing the final size was stronger for higher clustering levels. This finding was quite robust to the various parameters and choices, but we note some discrepancies. When halving the distance parameter of the gravity law, travel restrictions effectively reduced the final size for both high and low clustering levels, and hence clustering mattered less in this setting. The decrease in final size under travel restrictions was larger in this setting than for the main analysis. When the distance parameter is decreased, the destination and origin population increase in importance relative to the distance, and hence the commuting patterns become more similar for the different clustering levels. In the limit of lim<sub><italic>x</italic> &#x02192; 0</sub>
<italic>d</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>, the commuting networks are equal, and so we expect clustering to be less important for a lower distance parameter. For the UK based country, the reduction in final size with travel restrictions was larger than for the main analysis for higher clustering levels, and smaller for the lower clustering levels. The effect of travel restrictions on reducing final size was smaller for an exponential distance function in the gravity law, and there was no effect for the lowest clustering levels. Doubling the distance parameter in the gravity law, there was also no effect of travel restrictions on reducing final size for the lowest clustering levels. In these two commuting models, the distance is punished more, hence, there is more commuting to proximate locations compared to the gravity law used in the main analysis. Therefore, the country is more well-connected through the commuting network, especially for the lower clustering levels, and travel restrictions on non-commuting travel are most likely therefore less effective.</p><p>When commuting was modelled by a radiation law, there was little effect of travel restrictions on reducing final size, and no effect for the lowest clustering levels. This is likely due to the construction of the radiation law, which does not directly depend on distance, but rather on the population density between the locations, suppressing some of the clustering effects that are found with the gravity law. Less area is protected for the radiation law, especially for the lowest clustering levels, indicating that the countries are more well-connected through the commuting network, decreasing the effect of travel restrictions.</p><p>We investigated further how the reduction of final size varied by the type of location, that is, how rural or urban the location is. For all but the most urban locations, the final size clearly increased more with increased amount of travel for the higher clustering levels. The effect of travel restrictions on epidemic final size was thus larger for the higher clustering levels, but the effect was most prominent in the less urban areas. This was also the case when varying the length of stay for the long distance travellers, for the different set of disease parameters and for the country based on UK commuting and population size distributions. This is in accordance with [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], where they find no effect of travel restrictions in urban areas. The fact that the effect of travel restrictions was most prominent in the rural areas, might make them less attractive to implement. On the other hand, health care services are more scarce in rural areas than in urban areas, so it might also be attractive that the travel restrictions are most effective in the rural areas. This should be taken into account by policy planners and decision makers.</p><p>We note that a 99% travel restriction is a quite strong restriction, and the effect size on the final size is surprisingly low. In addition, there is a problem with compliance, economic costs and how this would work in practice, and such extreme travel restrictions are not very realistic. The vaccination intervention was much more effective in reducing the final size than internal travel restrictions, in agreement with [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

We found that internal travel restrictions had some effect on final size, as in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p><italic><bold>Peak prevalence and timing</bold></italic>. Internal travel restrictions delayed and reduced the peak. The reduction in peak prevalence was robust to all the settings considered. Under travel restrictions, we found that the higher the clustering, the higher the peak. This finding held for a range of parameter choices and assumptions, but the peak prevalence did not increase with clustering when commuting was modelled by a radiation law. For the exponential distance function in the gravity law, this was only the case for the full travel ban setting.</p><p>The peak occurred earlier for higher clustering levels for all the settings, except when the distance parameter was doubled. Travel restrictions were found to delay the peak for most settings. However, for the UK based country, with doubled destination population parameter and the radiation law settings, this was only the case for the lower clustering levels, while there was no delay effect for the higher clustering levels. Overall, the delay effects were smaller for the UK based country, the radiation law setting and when doubling the destination population parameter. Travel restrictions were more effective in delaying the peak for the lower clustering levels. This was true for all the settings considered, but the effect sizes depended on the various parameter choices and settings.</p><p>Our results are in agreement with [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], where travel restrictions were found to delay the epidemic. In [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it was found that a 50% travel restriction delayed the epidemic by 1.5 weeks, and we find a delay of 3-10 days, depending on the clustering level. With 90% travel restrictions, [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found a delay in the epidemic by a few days and [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found a one week delay in the spread. In our simulations, we found a delay of 4-27 days with 90% travel restrictions, depending on the clustering level. Our results are thus similar to the results in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] for the higher clustering levels (more specifically, <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 3.0, <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 2.0 and <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 1.5), while we find larger delay effects for the lower clustering levels.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Vaccination</title><p>Preferentially vaccinating urban locations was the single most effective strategy in reducing final size, though only slightly better than vaccinating uniformly. This is in accordance with the result in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], indicating little difference in the final size with a pro rata (uniform) vaccination strategy, and a sequential vaccination by population size-strategy. Preferentially vaccinating the more rural locations was clearly the most inferior strategy. The vaccination was slightly more effective for the lower clustering levels, but the epidemic progression was robust to the population clustering under all three vaccination strategies (in line with the baseline scenario), as opposed to under the travel restriction settings. This may be due to the travel restrictions breaking down specific infection routes, as opposed to the vaccination.</p><p><italic><bold>Combination strategy</bold></italic>. We implemented a combination strategy, combining 99% travel restrictions with the three different vaccination strategies. We found that the most effective strategy for reducing the final size of the epidemic was a combination of travel restrictions with urban vaccination, for all the clustering levels. The difference between the final size for the urban vaccination strategy and the uniform vaccination strategy was (slightly) larger for the higher clustering levels. This is likely because when extensive travel restrictions were imposed, the most rural areas were protected, as we have seen in the analyses. The combination strategy was very efficient in reducing the final size. Travel restrictions further reduced the final size with almost 20 percentage points for the lowest clustering level and 15 percentage points for the highest clustering level. For lower <italic>&#x003ba;</italic>, the travel restrictions were much more efficient in reducing final size when combined with vaccination, than in isolation.</p><p><italic><bold>Ethical issues</bold></italic>. There are of course ethical issues with spatially targeted vaccination strategies. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) ethical guidelines state that allocation of limited resources should be guided by equity [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. There are often inconsistencies between the optimal vaccination strategy and the most equitable vaccination strategy [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], focus is given to the trade off between equity, simplicity and robustness for efficient spatial allocation policies. Hence, the policy makers have to balance the effectiveness of the vaccine strategy and equity. In our setting, the urban vaccination strategy performed only slightly better than the uniform (fair) vaccination strategy, and hence the uniform vaccination strategy would be recommendable, taking equity into account.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study is subject to limitations. The scaling from Norwegian municipalities to block units should be handled with care. The data that we used to fit the population size distribution and gravity law were on a different scale than the block units used in the fictional country, and we can not assess how well these models generalise to the finer block unit scale. In addition, different ways of dividing the population into administrative units could yield different population distributions, which could affect the results. We believe that it is of key importance to model the commuting and the population sizes for the same scale and population, and since commuting data are not available on a finer scale (due to for instance privacy regulations), we have chosen to use the finest scale available for the commuting data. The block units can then be interpreted as a discretisation of administrative units. Census data are often collected for administrative units, but mobile phone data could be used as an information source for commuting on a square gridded fine scale resolution, and would have been an interesting alternative. The fine scale resolution of the fictional country is necessary for the clustering algorithm to provide smooth transitions between the different clustering levels. The fact that we consider the country in isolation and ignore bordering countries can result in edge effects, since the locations on the border might in reality have a connection to the neighbouring countries.</p><p>We address some of these limitations in our sensitivity analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s001">S1 Text</xref>. To handle the fact that different ways of defining administrative regions could affect the population distribution and in turn the results, we also perform the analysis on a country based on population data from the United Kingdom. The population size distribution for Norway was quite heterogeneous compared to other European countries examined, while United Kingdom had a more homogeneous population size distribution. Here, a gravity law fitted to commuting data for the United Kingdom is also used. We also perform sensitivity analysis on the parameters and shape of the gravity law. Though the qualitative patterns were not so sensitive to the choice of commuting model, the effect sizes were not robust to the shape of the commuting law.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Practical implications</title><p>According to the general model developed here, population clustering is an important determinant for the effect of travel restrictions. For high levels of clustering, internal travel restrictions decrease the final size of the epidemic, and this is most prominent in the rural areas. There is no large effect on the peak date for the high clustering levels. For the lower clustering levels, there is less of a benefit in terms of final size reduction. However, for lower clustering levels, the peak date is delayed when implementing internal travel restrictions. That means more time to plan and implement interventions and preventive measures. Internal travel restrictions reduce the peak prevalence for all the clustering levels, reducing the stress on the health care systems. In addition, we found that the higher clustering levels have larger spatial clustering in peak dates. The more spatial clustering in peak dates, the more stress on the health care systems. Whether it is more attractive to delay an epidemic or decrease the final size, depends on the specific influenza strain. If there is high morbidity, such that the patients require more and/or longer health care, it might be of importance to delay the epidemic, to prepare the health care system for the peak period. In addition, if there exists vaccines or other interventions, a delay in the epidemic can be of key importance for the effectiveness of the vaccination programme, since there is more time to distribute (and develop/improve) the vaccine or implement other interventions. The impact of vaccines depends on how early they are introduced (see for instance [<xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]). For the European countries we considered (by visual inspection), the minimum clustering level was around <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 0.5, and the highest around <italic>&#x003ba;</italic> = 3.0, and they will likely become even more clustered in the future. This means that according to our model, internal travel restrictions are likely to be less and less effective in delaying epidemics, while they will be more effective in decreasing final sizes (especially in rural areas). In addition, proximate regions will, to an even higher extent than today, experience their peak simultaneously. Hence, it will be even more important to be able to predict the peak timing, in order to prepare the health care system for the peak period. In addition, in order to minimise the final sizes of the epidemic, it is important not to neglect the urban locations for vaccination, and thus specific vaccination sentiment campaigns might target urban locations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006879.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Additional remarks and sensitivity analysis.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006879.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006879.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Population size distribution for the municipalities of Norway.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006879.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006879.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Population densities.</title><p>Population density in administrative units in Norway, Iceland, Germany, France, Netherlands and United Kingdom.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006879.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006879.s004"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title><italic>&#x003c4;</italic> = 0: Initial dates.</title><p>Initial dates for infection when <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> = 0.
