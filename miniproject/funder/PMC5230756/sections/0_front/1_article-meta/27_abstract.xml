 <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne arbovirus responsible of a large outbreak since December 2013 in the Americas from French islands in the Caribbean. Documentation of the epidemic was based on the survey of clinically suspected cases, providing limited information on the incidence of the disease overtime and the herd immunity of the general population at the end of the outbreak. Our study improved blood donors specimen collection and data obtained from the Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) screening implemented during the outbreak in order to prevent CHIKV transmission by blood products. After an 11 month follow up, we determine for Martinique and Guadeloupe islands the CHIKV-RNA positive rate: 0.42% and 0.36% respectively and the final IgG seroprevalence: 41.2% and 48.1%. Using a simulation model, we estimate the CHIKV duration of asymptomatic viremia to be between 2.3 and 2.5 days. Our findings will help in the comprehension of the natural history of infection and provide helpful data for prevention of Transfusion transmitted infections. Our study provides evidence that monitoring of Chikungunya infection based on NAT screening of voluntary blood donors can be implemented rapidly and provides real-time epidemiological information. This should be of specific relevance to the case of epidemics caused by viral infections with high numbers of asymptomatic forms such as observed with the currently emerging Zika virus.</p>
