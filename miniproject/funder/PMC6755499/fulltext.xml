Actual outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis are comparatively rare and occur when susceptible populations are exposed to hypervirulent clones, genetically distinct from the main carriage isolates. However, carriage isolates can evolve into pathogens through a limited number of recombination events. The present study examines the potential for the sequence type (ST)-192, by far the dominant clone recovered in recent meningococcal carriage studies in sub-Saharan Africa, to evolve into a pathogen. We used whole-genome sequencing on a collection of 478 meningococcal isolates sampled from 1- to 29-&#x02009;year-old healthy individuals in Arba Minch, southern Ethiopia in 2014. The ST-192 clone was identified in nearly 60&#x0200a;% of the carriers. Using complementary short- and long-read techniques for whole-genome sequencing, we were able to completely resolve genomes and thereby identify genomic differences between the ST-192 carriage strain and known pathogenic clones with the highest possible resolution. We conclude that it is possible, but unlikely, that ST-192 could evolve into a significant pathogen, thus, becoming the major invasive meningococcus clone in the meningitis belt of Africa following upcoming mass vaccination with a polyvalent conjugate vaccine that targets the A, C, W, Y and X capsules.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>whole-genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>ST-192 meningococci</kwd><kwd>capsule null</kwd><kwd>pathogen evolution</kwd><kwd>carriage</kwd><kwd>invasiveness</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OpenAccessEmbargo</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Data Summary</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing data are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena</ext-link>), under accession number PRJEB29233.

However, the majority of those infected carry the bacterium in the nasopharynx without ever developing symptoms. Transmission occurs largely through these asymptomatic carriers. Whether an infection leads to clinical meningitis is thought to be determined almost exclusively by specific genetic properties harboured by certain lineages of meningococci. With a massive vaccination campaign targeting the major capsulated forms of the bacterium about to be rolled out, concern has been raised as to whether currently non-pathogenic strains can develop epidemic potential through genetic recombination. The current study evaluates the epidemic potential of sequence type (ST)-192, the most common non-pathogenic lineage in the meningitis belt of Africa. We conclude that it is unlikely that ST-192 will evolve into an epidemic clone. Our findings are of particular importance for surveillance and preparedness against meningitis, vaccine development and eradication campaigns.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>
<italic>Neisseria meningitidis,</italic> the meningococcus, is a human commensal colonizing the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract that can be isolated from around 5&#x02013;10&#x0200a;% of the healthy population. The bacterium is transmitted among close-contacts through airborne droplets and the prevalence of carriage tends to be higher among children and adolescents, who serve as the main reservoirs [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Occasionally, <italic><named-content content-type="species">

Meningococcal disease occurs endemically throughout the world, but in a region designated as the meningitis belt in sub-Saharan Africa, outbreaks and epidemics occur every year in the dry season. During these epidemics, carriage prevalence of the outbreak strain can increase by a factor of 10 or more [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Except for very rare cases [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>], disease-causing meningococci are encapsulated and 12 known serogroups are defined based on the structure of the capsular polysaccharide [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Six of these serogroups, A, B, C, W, X and Y, are responsible for nearly all cases of disease worldwide [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, meningococci isolated from the oropharynx of healthy individuals are often unencapsulated [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Either down-regulation of capsule gene expression, phase variation in the capsule synthesis genes or inactivation of genes in the capsule gene cluster (<italic>cps</italic>) [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] might cause this. Finally, in some instances, the genetic inability of strains to produce a capsule is a consequence of a lack of regions of the capsule gene cluster. In these &#x02018;capsule null&#x02019; strains, the <italic>cps</italic> operon is replaced by a noncoding region (<italic>cnl</italic> region), resembling genetic regions seen in other neisserial species, such as <italic><named-content content-type="species">

The ST-192 cc is commonly identified in meningococcal carriage studies in Africa [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16</xref>], but rarely elsewhere in the world. In a carriage study performed in Ethiopia in 2014, we identified ST-192 isolates in nearly 60&#x0200a;% of the healthy carriers [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Factors that could explain the success of ST-192 include more efficient adhesion and consequently entry, due to no masking of adhesins by a bacterial capsule [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the deletion of the <italic>fetA</italic> gene, which encodes an immunogenic surface protein that is a potential target for the host complement system [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown how a benign meningococcal strain could evolve into a hypervirulent lineage through the acquisition of a few virulence genes, illustrating that minor genetic changes in a microbe can have major public-health consequences [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With the ongoing development of multivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccines to be implemented through large-scale campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it is essential to estimate the potential of <italic>cnl</italic> isolates to evolve into virulent and epidemic clones. To that purpose, we performed comparative genomic analyses on the isolates collected in the Ethiopian carriage study. We show that ST-192 isolates from healthy individuals lack several well-known virulence factors, including the full capsule operon, iron-acquisition machinery (including the deletion of <italic>fetA</italic>, encoding an enterobactin receptor) and the meningococcal disease-associated phage &#x003a6; (MDA&#x003a6;). These operons are only functional if acquired through homologous recombination of a complete and intact operon, rather than piecemeal horizontal transfer of smaller units. Based on the size of the capsule gene cluster missing from the Ethiopian ST-192 genomes, which exceeds the size of fragments typically acquired by this group, it seems unlikely that ST-192 could quickly evolve into an epidemic clone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sample collection and bacterial identification</title><p>Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 7479 healthy volunteers (1&#x02013;29-years-old), as described by B&#x000e5;rnes <italic>et al</italic>.

The eight non-groupable capsule genotypes (missing or truncated in one or several genes of the operon) were ST-175 (4; 1.1&#x0200a;%), ST-35 (3; 0.8&#x0200a;%) and ST-178 (1; 0.3&#x0200a;%).</p><p>ST-192 formed a very distinct clone within the full phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), with an intra-ST average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 99.9&#x0200a;%, versus a 97.3&#x0200a;% ANI of ST-192 to other STs. The ST-192 cc clustered first with the six closely related genotypes of the 13 <italic>cnl</italic> isolates not assigned to a cc described above. We could only find evidence of 23 recombination events within ST-192, with a median size of 2803 nucleotides (range: 17&#x02013;10&#x0200a;213), versus a median fragment size of 834 nucleotides (range: 4&#x02013;37&#x0200a;541) in the full dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) (Table S2). At least three of these recombination events were found in all Ethiopian ST-192 and involved known virulence factor systems. (Lipopolysaccharide synthesis through <italic>lptA</italic>, iron uptake through <italic>tbpA</italic> and type IV pili through <italic>pilDFG</italic>.) The phylogenetic tree topology makes it clear that the capsule locus must have been independently acquired (and lost) through horizontal transfer multiple times throughout the history of these meningococci, since both capsule X, C and non-capsule-expressing strains form polyphyletic groups in the tree.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of all isolates sequenced in this study, with cc, capsule type and <italic><named-content content-type="species">

For example, ST-11372 (49 isolates in total) was less frequent in Genta Mechie than expected (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1.0&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, chi-square test) and ST-192 less frequent in Kolla Shelle than would be expected from the overall distribution pattern (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;1.0&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>, chi-square test). However, after correcting for testing of multiple hypotheses, all significant patterns disappear. Thus, we assign no importance to this village-to-village difference in ST distribution, and consider all demographic variables to be uncorrelated to the genetic variation in our study population.</p><p>Next, we profiled the samples by means of rMLST, which assays 53 genes encoding ribosomal protein subunits [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This method has been shown to robustly characterize deeper evolutionary relationships as ribosomal genes are essential and under stabilizing selection. The rMLST score denotes the percentage of loci that were identical to that of the type strain. For example, an rMLST score of 98&#x0200a;% would mean that 52/53 loci from the <italic>rps</italic> gene cluster were identical to that of the type strain.

The STs with capsule X and capsule Y had the highest identity, with 46/49 of ST-11372 (X) and 6/6 of ST-11591 (also X) having 100&#x0200a;% identity. A total of 8/8 ST-207 had 98&#x0200a;% identity, and the final capsule X ST, ST-181, was the most variable with 95&#x02013;97&#x0200a;%&#x02009;identity across the 7 isolates. As for capsule Y, 16/18 had 100&#x0200a;% identity, with the remaining 2 having a single ribosomal mutation, bringing them down to 98&#x0200a;%.</p><p>Most ST-192 (251/278) had a 98&#x0200a;% rMLST score, dispelling the notion that they differ wildly from more typical meningococci. We found the lowest ribosomal score within ST-53 (94&#x02013;98&#x0200a;%), as well as in the closely related atypical capsule null STs that cluster with ST-192 cc isolates (ST-11587, ST-11593, ST-11595, ST-11597, ST-11617 and ST-11638.) These were clearly atypical in that their ribosomal score varied between 90&#x02013;96&#x0200a;%&#x02009;and they differed a lot in MLST types despite relatively low genomic differences. In contrast to ST-192 cc isolates, all the above mentioned harboured both <italic>porA</italic> and <italic>fetA</italic> genes. Finally, capsule C and W strains exhibited highly variable rMLST scores ranging from 94&#x02013;100&#x0200a;%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Genome comparison</title><p>With the advent of hybrid Illumina/nanopore sequencing, completely resolving genome assembly graphs (i.e. &#x02018;closing&#x02019; genomes) has become much easier. Comparing closed genomes allows us to inspect the entire set of genetic elements shared and unique between invasive and non-invasive isolates. Armed with this technology, we set out to determine exactly how far off the carriage clone ST-192 is from evolving into a pathogen. Two previously closed genomes can contribute key information to this puzzle: Nig8/13 (invasive, serogroup C) (BIGS ID no. 56&#x0200a;602) and BL16188 (non-invasive and capsule null) (BIGS ID no. 56&#x0200a;603) [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. BL16188 represents the closest known non-pathogenic relative to the Niger/Nigeria ST-10217 epidemic strain (represented by Nig8/13) and is, therefore, of great interest with respect to the minimum evolution needed to go from a carriage strain to invasiveness. It was previously demonstrated that conversion from a carriage to an epidemic phenotype was brought about in these two strains simply by the horizontal transfer of an intact capsule locus and the MDA&#x003a6; phage [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In this analysis, we also included the genomes of two South African ST-192 isolates [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that were highly unusual in that they caused invasive disease. These two genomes have not been closed, but they have been whole-genome sequenced with Illumina technology, which is indicative of resolution of the most important parts of the genome but incomplete contig ordering and with contig breaks in highly repetitive regions or at copy number variations.</p><p>In order to identify gene elements potentially important for invasiveness, we performed a pan-genome allelic all-versus-all comparison between the two invasive South African ST-192 isolates mentioned above [36718 (BIGS ID no. 41&#x0200a;869) and 34526 (BIGS ID no. 41&#x0200a;961)], the ST-10217 carrier BL16188 and its closely related hyperinvasive strain Nig8/13, as well as two non-invasive, capsule null (<italic>cnl</italic>) closed ST-192 genomes (AR00441 and AR06000). We binned the genome contents into seven groups based on presence/absence patterns. (A) Genes found in all invasive isolates, but not in any non-invasive isolates. (B) Genes that are exclusively found in the hyperinvasive/epidemic isolate Nig8/13. (C) Genes that are found in all ST-10217, but not in any ST-192 isolates. Although BL16188 displayed a carrier phenotype, it is possible that it was &#x02018;primed&#x02019; with genetic elements that could more quickly turn it into a hyperinvasive pathogen. (D) Genes that are found in all ST-192 isolates, but not in any ST-10217 isolates. (E) Genes that are found in both the carrier ST-192 isolates, and not in any other isolates. (F) Genes that are found in all isolates except for the two South African ST-192. Finally, (G) core genes; genes present in all six isolates and, therefore, irrelevant to the virulence differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Visualization of the pan-genomic gene-by-gene approach to analyse virulence factors across invasive and carrier ST-192 and ST-10217.

Rather strikingly, the most obvious difference between the invasive and carrier isolates was that all the invasive isolates in this study had an intact MDA&#x003a6; phage, whereas the carrier isolates did not. Although the importance of this phage in ST-10217 has been previously described, it is noteworthy that the same change appears to play a major role in ST-192. In this case, the MDA&#x003a6; phage is the only relevant component that is present in the invasive and lacking in non-invasive strains. All other differences between invasive and carriage ST-192 isolates are either minor allelic changes in presumably unimportant genes, largely in genes encoding hypothetical proteins. It appears as if infection with the MDA&#x003a6; phage alone was sufficient to induce invasiveness in the South African ST-192. Notably, the presence of a capsule is not necessary for non-epidemic infections. However, the two ST-192 from South Africa were recovered 8&#x02009;months apart from a single patient with a C6 complement deficiency. It is possible that a capsule just is not necessary for invasiveness in such patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Group B &#x02013; epidemic versus non-epidemic</title><p>Two virulence factors were uniquely found in the hyperinvasive/epidemic ST-10217 (the group B comparison): an intact capsule (genes <italic>ctrABCDG</italic> and <italic>csc</italic>) and the NEIS0527 (<italic>frpC</italic>) gene. The <italic>frpC</italic> gene encodes an RTX family cytotoxin involved in adhesion, and is secreted by bacteria under iron-deprived conditions through a type I secretion system [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The capsule is involved in anti-phagocytosis and intracellular survival, but actually impedes colonization and mucosal adherence [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18, 36</xref>]. Although not necessary for standalone invasive infections [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4, 13</xref>], it is possible that the capsule is a necessary factor for a strain to become epidemic. The presence of a capsule seems to be uniformly present in all strains causing outbreaks and epidemics, whereas the opposite is not true; many strains have intact capsule operons without leading to outbreaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Groups C and D &#x02013; ST-192 versus ST-10217</title><p>Some further differences between ST-192 and ST-10217 (comparisons C and D) were that ST-192 contains <italic>pglB</italic> and ST-10217 <italic>pglB2</italic>, which means that their O-linked glycosylation pathways differ and that the two STs produce functionally different lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, ST10217 has the ferric enterobactin receptor <italic>fetA</italic>, whereas it is lacking in ST-192. ST-192 does, however, have NEIS2529/NMB1449, which encodes a TonB-dependent receptor. It is not known whether <italic>fetA</italic> and NEIS2529 perform equivalent functions, although both are involved in iron acquisition. Also unique in ST-10217 was the capsule translocation system encoded by the genes <italic>ctrEF</italic>. Note that these genes were also found in the apathogenic BL16188, despite this isolate lacking a capsule. The <italic>ctrEF</italic> genes were located next to where the horizontally acquired capsule would be inserted, just upstream and on the opposite strand to <italic>ctrG</italic>. The fact that the apathogenic BL16188 had this system in place probably helped make the transformation to the capsule-expressing phenotype possible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Group E &#x02013; the ST-192 carrier phenotype</title><p>The carrier ST-192 (AR00441 and AR06000) did not contain any virulence factors that were absent in other groups.

Until now, only capsulated strains of serogroup A, B, C, W, X or Y have been capable of producing epidemics. This is likely due to the increased survivability of capsulated strains, mainly manifested through capsular protection against phagocytosis and antimicrobial peptides from the host immune system [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18, 41</xref>]. Traditionally, serogroup A meningococci have dominated the meningitis belt. However, the prevalence of serogroup A disease has been drastically reduced following large-scale vaccination with the conjugate serogroup A vaccine MenAfriVac since 2010. New cc types with non-A capsule types have since emerged, notably serogroup C, which had only rarely been seen in Africa in past decades, but which has recently re-emerged and caused massive yearly outbreaks since 2013. Now, as mass vaccination with a pentavalent ACWXY conjugate vaccine is being considered [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the major question is whether non-targeted capsule types are set to take the stage. Assuming that the ACWXY vaccine is efficient against all incorporated capsule types, the only major capsule type left to acquire is B, which is commonly found in Europe and North America, but comparatively rare in Africa. Capsule homologues have also recently been identified in several species of non-pathogenic <italic><named-content content-type="genus">

The ST-10217 carrier strain represented by BL16188 is thought to have become hypervirulent after acquiring a type C capsule and the MDA&#x003a6; phage. We know from the present work and that of Ganesh <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that ST-192 can become invasive through the acquisition of this phage, so the major unknowns are if such a strain could also (1) acquire an intact type B capsule operon, and (2) that this would increase the survivability of the strain enough to induce hypervirulence. Horizontal transfer of intact whole capsule operons is rare. ST-10217 did not completely lack capsule genes: it harboured intact alleles of the <italic>ctrEF</italic> genes, which are responsible for capsule translocation. Comparatively, ST-192 completely lacks all capsule genes and would have to acquire a fragment of around 20&#x02009;kb to be able to synthetize a capsule on its surface (region A, <italic>cssABC</italic>, <italic>csb</italic>, <italic>ctrG</italic>; region B, <italic>ctrEF</italic>; region C, <italic>ctrABCD</italic>). Furthermore, a capsule operon would have the highest probability of being functional if acquired through a single recombination event (as opposed to multiple, partly overlapping events). We have analysed the length of fragments acquired through homologous recombination within carrier strains in our collection from Ethiopia, as well as specifically within the ST-192 carrier strains. From these analyses, we conclude that the acquisition of a type B capsule operon by an ST-192 member is unlikely, as this will require the incorporation of a sequence tract exceeding the size of fragments typically horizontally acquired by this group (shown in this paper), or in <italic><named-content content-type="species">

We, therefore, propose that despite its ubiquity, ST-192 is not particularly poised to take over as a dominant invasive clone in the wake of mass vaccination with a polyvalent ACWXY vaccine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Data bibliography" id="s6"><title>Data bibliography</title><p>1.
