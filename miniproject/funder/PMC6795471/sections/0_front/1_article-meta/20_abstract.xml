 <p>Arboviral diseases are a growing public health concern in the world, especially in tropical areas known to be favorable for the proliferation and dispersion of the 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito, the main vector of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya. Recurrent epidemics highlight the need for effective endemic disease control and prevention, as well as health education. Therefore, our study analyzed the perception of Endemic Disease Control Agents (ACE) about their professional performance and presented a deepened discussion about the factors that enhance and impair their work in the field. Our investigation identified four categories of factors that influence the performance of ACE: work practice and routines, challenges in the practice of the profession, work assessment, and job satisfaction. These findings reinforce ACE and professional qualification as fundamental for the prevention and control of arboviruses. Thus, measures must be put in place to promote the recognition and appreciation of these professionals. Also, the implementation of actions and allocation of resources to this sector may improve the quality of service provided, which would consequently reduce the impact of these still neglected diseases on the health and living conditions of the population.
