We study the effectiveness of Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) insecticide spraying in public spaces for preventing secondary dengue virus (DENV) cases in Porto Alegre, a non-endemic metropolitan area in Brazil. We developed a stochastic transmission model based on detailed entomological, epidemiological and population data, accounting for the geographical distribution of mosquitoes and humans in the study area and spatial transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated against the distribution of DENV cluster sizes previously estimated from the same geographical setting. We estimated a ULV-induced mortality of 40% for mosquitoes and found that the implemented control protocol avoided about 24% of symptomatic cases occurred in the area throughout the 2015&#x02013;2016 epidemic season. Increasing the radius of treatment or the mortality of mosquitoes by treating gardens and/or indoor premises would greatly improve the result of control, but trade-offs with respect to increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed. We found a moderate effectiveness for ULV-spraying in public areas, mainly due to the limited ability of this strategy in effectively controlling the vector population. These results can be used to support the design of control strategies in low-incidence, non-endemic settings.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection that causes millions of symptomatic infections and thousands of deaths per year. This pathogen is expanding its geographic range to areas that were previously free from autochthonous transmission thanks to the intensification of international travels, urbanization and to climatic adaptation of mosquitoes and viruses. Usually interventions against dengue transmission consist in insecticide spraying aimed at killing adult mosquitoes, but the impact of this practice has been rarely evaluated in real-life settings. In this work, we estimate the proportion of dengue cases avoided by Ultra-Low-Volume insecticide spraying in public areas in Porto Alegre (Brazil). This city is characterized by a subtropical climate, negligible pre-existing immunity and low dengue incidence. The low incidence makes this region unsuitable for deployment of the currently licensed vaccine, which is only recommended by the WHO for high-transmission areas. We found that insecticide spraying avoided approximately one fourth of all symptomatic cases. The performance of the intervention was negatively affected by the low treatment-induced mosquito mortality, as we estimated that only 40% of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> are killed by the insecticide.

Four distinct DENV serotypes exist; infection by one of them confers life-long immunity to that serotype and temporary cross-immunity to others. However, secondary dengue infections with different serotypes are more likely to cause severe illness because of an immune process known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where pre-existing cross-reacting antibodies do not neutralize but rather enhance viral replication [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In Southern America, continental control efforts in the 1970s had come close to eliminate <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the main vector mosquito, but in the last two decades arboviruses have strongly increased their circulation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] thanks to the intensification of international travels [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], international trade [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and urbanization [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and to climatic adaptation of mosquitoes and viruses [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In particular, DENV is expanding its geographic range to areas that were previously free from autochthonous transmission and are now prone to multiple outbreaks each year. A DENV vaccine has been recently licensed, with an overall efficacy of about 60% against its four serotypes [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; however, after deployment in 10 different countries, increased hospitalization rates in children were reported, raising suspects that the currently available vaccine may predispose individuals who were seronegative before vaccination to ADE [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, modeling studies and the World Health Organization recommend the vaccine for high-transmission settings only where the proportion of seronegative vaccinees is very low [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In non-endemic settings, the main strategy for DENV control consists in the management of vector populations via insecticide spraying as a reactive intervention to ongoing local transmission. Despite its popularity, this practice has been rarely evaluated in terms of its impact on DENV transmission in real-life settings [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Such evaluation is made difficult by the inherently complex interactions between dynamics of mosquito populations, viral transmission and insecticide uptake in structured spaces and time-varying environmental conditions [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, DENV transmission and control interventions typically occur over geographic scales of a few hundred meters [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], making it necessary to consider spatial heterogeneities explicitly and at a high resolution [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To estimate the effectiveness of insecticide spraying on DENV containment, we developed a novel mechanistic computational framework, coupling a model for mosquito population dynamics and a disease transmission model over a high-resolution spatial grid. Mechanistic models are widely used to study mosquito-borne pathogens such as DENV, for instance to investigate outbreaks in a previously unaffected area [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], assess vaccine effectiveness [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or to compare transmission of different viruses in the same area [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Many of the available models do not include explicitly the mosquito immature stages [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which need to be considered to accurately reproduce the dynamics of recovery of the vector population after adulticide treatment. Spatial transmission models are another common epidemiological tool that has been used to study DENV control in different parts of the world [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

The reactive control policies implemented to reduce DENV transmission consisted in ULV insecticide spraying in public spaces such as roads and parks (i.e., not indoor or in private gardens), within an area of radius 200m around the residence of the patient triggering the intervention.

This value is compatible with field experiments showing that the majority of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> rest within households [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; furthermore, other studies measured the mortality of mosquitoes resting in sheltered locations [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or in the vegetation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] at values between 30% and 50%, indicating a moderate effect of ULV treatment on mosquito populations.</p><p>To improve the effectiveness of control, a larger area might be treated, but the trade-off between increasing effort and increasing benefits needs to be taken into account. We estimate that increasing the intervention radius to 300m around the triggering case would result in about 143 additionally avoided cases (an increase by 60%) compared to the current protocol but requires treating a total area that is 2.25 times larger. An alternative way to improve the current control strategy would be to target private gardens and/or indoor spaces. An increase in the proportion of killed mosquitoes from 40% to 60&#x02013;70% would improve the overall effectiveness by a similar amount than that allowed by expanding the treated radius to 300m. A similar efficacy could also be achieved by increasing the frequency of treatment for confirmed cases from 60% (<italic>q</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub>) and 46% (<italic>q</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>) to 100%, which would avoid 38.6% (95%CI: 33.6&#x02013;43.7%, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006831.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>) of the expected cases. Alternative approaches towards the reduction of DENV transmission might consider routine preventive interventions, rather than reactive ones, such as deploying larvicides in city areas with highest mosquito abundance [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>A potential source of uncertainty in our study is the role of asymptomatic individuals in viral transmission. Duong et al. have shown that mosquitoes can be infected by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic children [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but key parameters such as their transmission rate to mosquitoes, the transmission rate to humans by mosquitoes infected by asymptomatic individuals and the asymptomatic infectious period, remain unknown. Since the study by Duong et al., asymptomatic transmission has been included in most recent transmission models for dengue as a reduced human-to-mosquito transmission rate arbitrarily fixed between 0% and 50% of the value for symptomatic individuals [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we assumed as a baseline that asymptomatic individuals do not transmit the infection; however, we run two alternative scenarios where asymptomatic transmission occurred as the symptomatic one and also at a relative transmission rate of 50% and we found that in both cases the relative reduction of DENV cases granted by ULV treatment would be similar (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006831.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>).</p><p>Among further potential limitations, we acknowledge that large temperature fluctuations may have a negative impact on <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> biology [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, in the absence of sufficient data to parametrize these effects, we modelled mosquito population dynamics by considering only average daily temperatures, similarly to previously published modelling studies (e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Furthermore, our temperature data came from a single weather station for the whole city. The effect of within-day and local variability of temperature may be a source of bias for our estimates, whose impact is very difficult to assess.</p><p>We did not consider the potential effect of treatment on mosquito capture data for the estimation of the mosquito population. This assumption was based on two observations: first, the limited capture rate of sticky traps, combined with the coarse (weekly) temporal resolution of captures and the small ULV-induced mosquito mortality, make it difficult to detect a significant effect of treatment on capture data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006831.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> for details); second, treatment at any given time included a very limited proportion of the study area, so that the expected effect on the total abundance in the area is marginal. As a proof, we re-computed the mosquito abundance by simulating treatments at the time and sites where they were actually administered during 2016, assuming an effectiveness &#x003c1; = 40%; the maximum difference in the total mosquito population compared to the no-treatment scenario was less than 10% at all times.</p><p>In the absence of a safe vaccine for DENV in non-endemic settings, the prevention of dengue transmission will continue to rely on the management of mosquito populations. Quantifying how ULV mosquito control translates into a mitigation of the disease burden is a critical but still unanswered public health question [<xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This study provides a quantitative estimate of the effectiveness of ULV treatment in a non-endemic setting where dengue transmission has established only recently, based on recent insights on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue and on high-resolution entomological, population, clinical and treatment data. Our results can be used to support the design and implementation of future interventions in areas at the margins of the geographical range of DENV (e.g. in Southern Europe, USA, subtropical South America and Australia) which are undergoing a similar epidemiological transition, or are expected to do so in the next future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec008"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006831.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Supporting text containing methodological details and additional results.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006831.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006831.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Entomological dataset.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006831.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the Health Vigilance Coordination from the Health Secretary of Porto Alegre city (CGVS) for the support in disease surveillance and data collection, and to Ecovec for data availability.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pcbi.1006831.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bhatt</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gething</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>OJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Messina</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Farlow</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Moyes</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Drake</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Brownstein</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hoen</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sankoh</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Myers</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>George</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jaenisch</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wint</surname><given-names>GR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Simmons</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>TW</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Farrar</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>SI</given-names></name>. <article-title>The global distribution and burden of dengue</article-title>. <source>Nature</source>. <year>2013</year>;<volume>496</volume>(<issue>7446</issue>):<fpage>504</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>7</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/nature12060</pub-id>
