Recently, the discovery of antiviral peptides (AVPs) has become an influential antiviral agent due to their extraordinary advantages. With the avalanche of newly-found peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, there is a great demand to develop a sequence-based predictor for timely identifying AVPs as this information is very useful for both basic research and drug development. In this study, we propose a novel sequence-based meta-predictor with an effective feature representation, called Meta-iAVP, for the accurate prediction of AVPs from given peptide sequences. Herein, the effective feature representation was extracted from a set of prediction scores derived from various machine learning algorithms and types of features. To the best of our knowledge, the model proposed herein represents the first meta-based approach for the prediction of AVPs. An overall accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient of 95.20% and 0.90, respectively, was achieved from the independent test set on an objective benchmark dataset. Comparative analysis suggested that Meta-iAVP was superior to that of existing methods and therefore represents a useful tool for AVP prediction. Finally, in an effort to facilitate high-throughput prediction of AVPs, the model was deployed as the Meta-iAVP web server and is made freely available online at http://codes.bio/meta-iavp/ where users can submit query peptide sequences for determining the likelihood of whether or not these peptides are AVPs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>therapeutic peptides</kwd><kwd>antiviral peptide</kwd><kwd>classification</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>random forest</kwd><kwd>meta-predictor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijms-20-05743"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Human morbidity, mortality, and economic productivity continue to be affected by viral infections and their associated diseases. The dominance of sporadic viral outbreaks by zoonotic viruses such as Ebola and Zika in recent years have added to the prevalence of viral species with which humans are already in battle (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rhinoviruses, and influenza viruses). Viruses are successful in causing malaise to humans due to their high genetic variation, different routes of transmission, efficient replication, and the capability to persist in the host cells [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, according to the global threat list of 2019 as compiled by the WHO, virus infections were seen to dominate [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although, up until recently, trial and error has led to the discovery of 90 antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of 9 virus families (i.e., HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes virus, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human papillomavirus), these drugs cannot begin to cover the &#x0003e;200 viruses discovered thus far [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, major breakthroughs in combating viral infections by vaccine production have led to remarkable advances in modern medicine such as the eradication and control of disease such as small pox [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and polio [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], respectively. Nevertheless, the development of new vaccines remains a huge challenge in terms of time and expenses [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Unfortunately, the ever-increasing reports of antiviral resistance [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] coupled with the emergence and re-emergence of viral epidemics as observed for H1N1 [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Ebola [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and Zika [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] viruses, demands the production of new antiviral drugs with broad-spectrum activity [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More recently, peptide-based drugs have gained much interest as a new class of drugs due to their ability to be highly selective, relatively safe while also possessing good tolerability and a lower production cost [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Besides the advantages of peptide-based drugs, a short half-life, immunogenic potential, and low oral absorption are some of their current limitations [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Antiviral peptides (AVPs) is a subset belonging to the group of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and in that regard, exhibits antiviral activity. As of 23 September, 2019, the antimicrobial database (APD3) contains a total of 3129 AMPs, out of which, 188 are antiviral peptides [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, another database of antimicrobial peptides, DRAMP 2.0, contains 19,899 entries which consist of general, patent, and clinical AMPs [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, a database focused solely on antiviral peptides contains 2683 experimentally verified AVPs including 624 modified AVPs [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Additionally, there are other databases that focus on the structure and antimicrobial activity of natural and synthetic peptides [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] as well as therapeutic peptides [<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, it is evident that peptide-based research is gaining momentum. In some cases, a given peptide shows more than one activity and is, therefore, called a promiscuous peptide (i.e., showing dual antimicrobial and antiviral effects). In addition, AVPs have been shown to possess cationic and amphipathic characteristics with positive net charges, all of which are essential for these peptides to work as antimicrobials [<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, hydrophobicity seems to be a key property for peptides with activity against enveloped viruses [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To date, Fuzeon&#x02122; (Enfuvirtide), a synthetic peptide that blocks viral fusion by binding to gp41 (polypeptide chain) of HIV type-1 envelope protein is the only peptide to have been commercialized [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, Bulevirtide&#x02122; (Myrcludex B), an anti-Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D peptide targeting sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) of liver cells, has also been studied in a phase IIb clinical trial [<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and is scheduled for phase III trials [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The structure of some AVPs that have already been elucidated experimentally, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, there are several mechanisms of action whereby antiviral therapeutic agents can inhibit viral activity (i.e., block the attachment of viruses, prevent fusion of viruses to host cells, interrupt the signaling process of viruses, or inhibit the replication of viruses in host cells) [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Currently, some studies have shown that AVPs inhibit the fusion of viruses to host cells [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; while others have shown that AVPs interfere with viral replication [<xref rid="B33-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and attachment of the virus to host cells [<xref rid="B36-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For example, P9, an AVP derived from mouse &#x003b2;-defensin acts against various flu strains (i.e., H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9) by binding to viral glycoproteins and inhibiting RNA replication through the prevention of viral fusion in the endosome [<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, protegrin-1, a cyclical cationic peptide derived from swine white blood cells, showed potent antiviral activity against dengue virus by inhibiting the specific viral protease important for dengue virus replication, named NS2B-NS3pro [<xref rid="B40-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Hence, accurately identifying the biological activities of peptides provides great importance for the exploration of the mechanism of action of AVPs and the development of antiviral drugs. However, the experimental approaches are still very slow, inefficient, and expensive. Besides, with the rapid explosion of newly-found peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, the peptide sequences in various database are rapidly increasing day by day. In that regard, bioinformatics-based tools are crucial for efficient analysis of the ever-increasing availability of data. Thus, it is in a great demand to develop a prediction model based on an efficient machine learning algorithm for fast and reliably identifying the biological activities of peptides according to their primary sequences. This process could further shed light on novel AVPs having potent clinical outcomes.</p><p>Until now, there are four prediction models based on various machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been developed for AVP prediction, i.e., AVPpred [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Chang et al.&#x02019;s method [<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Zare et al.&#x02019;s method [<xref rid="B43-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and AntiVPP 1.0 [<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Three of the four prediction models [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] were performed on the same benchmark datasets, as summarized in <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Initially, Thakur et al. [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] was the first to propose a prediction model for AVP prediction called AVPred as well as established the two benchmark datasets T<sup>544p+407n</sup> + V<sup>60p+45n</sup> and T<sup>544p+544n</sup> + V<sup>60p+60n</sup>. AVPred was constructed by using a support vector machine (SVM)-based model with physicochemical properties from the AAindex database. AVPred provided moderate prediction accuracies on the independent datasets V<sup>60p+45n</sup> and V<sup>60p+60n</sup> of 85.7% and 92.5%, respectively. Shortly afterward, Chang et al. [<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] utilized a combination feature of amino acid composition (AAC) and aggregation tendencies to develop a random forest (RF) model. Their prediction model achieved higher prediction accuracies as compared to AVPred with 89.5% and 93.3% for T<sup>544p+407n</sup> + V<sup>60p+45n</sup> and T<sup>544p+544n</sup> + V<sup>60p+60n</sup> datasets, respectively. Recently, Lissabet et al. [<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] proposed a computation tool based on RF in conjunction with various physicochemical properties called AntiVPP 1.0. In their experimental setting, AntiVPP 1.0 was developed using one of the two benchmarked datasets, i.e., T<sup>544p+544n</sup> + V<sup>60p+60n</sup> and obtained a prediction accuracy of 93.0% which did not show any improvement as compared to AVPpred and Chang et al.&#x02019;s method. Although, the above-mentioned methods produced promising results, there is still room for improvement in regards to prediction performance. First, the features used for constructing the previous methods did not offer the sequence-order or position-specific information and hence might considerably limit the prediction quality. Second, most of the existing predictors [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] were developed using the embodiment of redundant features, causing a decrease in performance. Finally, the accuracy and transferability of the prediction model still require improvement.</p><p>Motivated by the aforementioned issues, we proposed a novel sequence-based meta-predictor, called Meta-iAVP, for the prediction of AVPs from given peptide sequences to address the shortcomings of the existing methods. First, the benchmark datasets were collected to construct a model and fairly compare with the previous models. Second, we encoded the peptide sequence with AAC, pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition (Am-PseAAC), dipeptide composition (DPC), and g-gap dipeptide composition (GDC). Third, we fed each feature separately into six different ML algorithms, i.e., RF, SVM, <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbor (<italic>k</italic>-NN), recursive partitioning and regression trees (rpart), generalized linear model (glm), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), to generate a new feature representation. Subsequently, effective feature representation was used to build a meta-predictor. The performance comparisons on the two benchmark datasets illustrated that Meta-iAVP significantly outperformed other existing AVP predictors. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is the first meta-based approach in the prediction of AVPs. We anticipate that Meta-iAVP may serve as a useful computational resource for high-throughput AVP prediction and also facilitate experimental researchers in the discovery of novel AVPs. Finally, for the convenience of experimental scientists, a Meta-iAVP web server was established and made freely available online at <uri xlink:href="http://codes.bio/meta-iavp/">http://codes.bio/meta-iavp/</uri>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-20-05743"><title>2. Results</title><p>In this study, AVPs and Non-AVPs were predicted by the proposed method Meta-iAVP. Firstly, the importance of each amino acid to antiviral activities of peptides using mean decrease of Gini index (MDGI) and univariate analysis were performed. Secondly, the features that are beneficial for discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs were determined by conducting performance comparisons between five types of features, i.e., AAC (20D), DPC (400D), GDC (400D), PseAAC (20 + 2&#x003bb;), and Am- PseAAC (20 + 2&#x003bb;), and six commonly used ML algorithms. Thirdly, Meta-iAVP based on the meta-predictor was constructed by using the new feature representation as the input feature. Finally, to serve easy and rapid classification of query peptide sequence, Meta-iAVP is exploited as a free prediction web server for discriminating AVPs and Non-AVPs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f002">Figure 2</xref> summarizes the workflow of the computational approach of Meta-iAVP.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-20-05743"><title>2.1.

In this study, the value of MDGI was adopted to rank and estimate the importance of each AAC and DPC feature. <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> list the percentage values of the top 20 amino acids for both AVPs and Non-AVPs as derived from experimental validation and random datasets, respectively. In addition, a heatmap showing the feature importance for DPC is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f003">Figure 3</xref>. From <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, it can be observed that the ten informative amino acids with the highest MDGI values are Lys, Thr, Leu, Ile, Ser, Trp, Asn, Arg, Cys, and Glu (49.27, 46.27, 35.06, 34.52, 30.95, 30.93, 30.19, 28.52, 26.33, and 24.87, respectively) and Lys, Pro, Cys, Thr, Ser, Trp, Val, Ala, Gly, and Leu (77.11, 68.87, 57.68, 46.84, 39.57, 36.83, 25.69, 24.40, 24.25, and 23.80, respectively) for the experimental validation and random Non-AVP datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f003">Figure 3</xref>a,b shows that the five top-ranked dipeptides according to their MDGI value are LL, RK, LV, WI, and EI for the experimentally validated dataset (T<sup>544p+407n</sup>dataset) and KR, KK, GP, AS, and SA for the random Non-AVP dataset (T<sup>544p+544n</sup> dataset), respectively.</p><p>Interestingly, three of the five top-ranked informative amino acids from both <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, are common and represent polar amino acids (i.e., Lys, Thr, and Ser), while the other amino acids are non-polar and hydrophobic residues (i.e., Leu and Ile for the experimental dataset and Pro for the random Non-AVP dataset). As stated, the top ranked amino acid, Lysine (Lys) was observed in both the experimentally validated dataset as well as the random Non-AVP dataset. Being a basic residue, Lys is abundantly found in the composition of therapeutic peptides due to its ability to enhance the electrostatic properties that facilitate the interaction and insertion of peptides into the anionic cell walls and phospholipid membranes of microorganisms [<xref rid="B53-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, the cationic role of Lys is observed in various AMPs which also function as AVPs. For instance, first published in 1986, the study by Daher et al. [<xref rid="B54-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported the antiviral role of a cationic peptide, &#x003b1;-defensin which was described as inhibiting a number of viruses including herpes simplex virus types one and two, cytomegalovirus as well as inhibiting the vesicular stomatitis virus with human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1) in vitro. Since then, many reports have shown antiviral activity of cationic host-defense peptides such as &#x003b1;-defensins (i.e., HNP-1, HNP-2, HNP-3, and HNP-4), &#x003b2;-defensins (i.e., HBD-2 and HBD-3), and &#x003b8;-defensin (i.e., Retrocyclin-2), and the use of effective antiviral therapy with cathelicidins (i.e., LL-37), as previously reviewed [<xref rid="B36-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Furthermore, Mandelboim et al. observed that the initiation of lysis via natural killer cells by the P8 epitope of coxsackie viral peptide was pronounced with Lys as compared to other basic amino acid residues such as Arg or His [<xref rid="B60-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Hence, the role of Lys in providing cationic properties to a given peptide sequence is fundamental and leads to the enhancement of its antiviral activities.</p><p>Threonine (Thr) is another common amino acid observed between the two datasets of <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Thr plays an essential role in the phosphorylation of virus-encoded serine/threonine kinases, a unique feature of large DNA viruses [<xref rid="B61-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This important phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein by interfering with its enzymatic activity, cellular location, and/or association with other proteins [<xref rid="B61-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, a disruption of this property could hinder the efficient spread of the virus. This notion was also elucidated in a study conducted by Santos et al. [<xref rid="B62-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] on a nuclear shuttle protein (NSP)-interacting kinase (NIK1) which acts as a receptor-like kinase identified as a virulence target of the begomovirus NSP. The authors conducted mutagenesis on residues Thr-474 and Thr-468 on the A-loop of the NIK1 and observed that these mutations impaired autophosphorylation and were unable to attain kinase activation. In addition, Hale et al. [<xref rid="B63-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] reported that an Ala substitution of Thr-215 of the NS1 protein phosphorylation mechanism caused a disruption in viral propagation of human influenza A virus. Similarly, Hemonnot et al. [<xref rid="B64-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] conducted mutational analysis of HIV mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK-2) by substitution of Thr-23 to Ala-23. The resulting electron microscopy and western blot analysis showed that the substitution of a single Thr-23 residue, which provided an essential function in the release of viral particles from the cell surface, was disrupted. Thus, from the aforementioned studies, it is clear that Thr is extremely vital for proper kinase phosphorylation of viral proteins which further allow for efficient viral budding from infected cells.</p><p>The third most important amino acid observed from <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> was Serine (Ser) which plays an essential role in several cellular and metabolic processes [<xref rid="B65-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition, as previously mentioned, Ser also makes up an important component of virus-encoded serine/threonine kinases [<xref rid="B61-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, an extensively studied and well-known AMP, lactoferrin, is recognized as a potent inhibitor of various viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus types one and two, human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. [<xref rid="B66-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. One such study conducted by Scala et al. [<xref rid="B66-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], examined in detail the structure of lactoferrin-derived peptides and their activity against influenza virus using protein-protein interactions. In addition, all the peptide fragments tested were derived from the Ser418-Pro429 loop which formed a structural conformation that was critical for the resulting peptide activity. The authors noted that the presence of Ser was observed in the top three active peptide fragments. Hence, the presence of Ser in terms of formation of effective peptides for antiviral activity is highly advantageous.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-20-05743"><title>2.2.

As described above, AAC and PseAAC are the most important features for discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs. Thus, to verify the power of these two features in AVP prediction, the six ML models are trained with the AAC and PseAAC features for performing on the benchmark datasets T<sup>544p+407n</sup> + V<sup>60p+45n</sup> and T<sup>544p+544n</sup> + V<sup>60p+60n</sup>, respectively, and their performance comparisons are listed in <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Amongst the six ML models, <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows that the RF model with the AAC feature performs best with the highest Ac, Sn, Sp, and MCC of 86.54%, 86.54%, 86.36%, and 0.73, respectively, over the independent validation test on V<sup>60p+45n</sup> dataset.

In the previous sub-section, the AAC and PseAAC were mentioned as the optimum features amongst the five popular-used features, thus, these two features were used to compare with the new feature representation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new feature representation, the principle component analysis (PCA) approach is used to compare the distribution of AVPs (red circles) and Non-AVPs (blue circles) by representing them with PCA scores as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f006">Figure 6</xref>. In this study, PCA analysis was performed using the FactorMineR R package [<xref rid="B72-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] in R programing environment. To perform PCA analysis, T<sup>544p+407n</sup> + V<sup>60p+45n</sup> and T<sup>544p+544n</sup> + V<sup>60p+60n</sup> datasets were represented by the first two PCs (PC1 and PC2), where the percentage of variance can be explained by the first two PCs where high percentage values is suggestive of the feature importance for the predictive model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,c depict the distribution of AAC and a new feature representation, respectively, obtained from the dataset T<sup>544p+407n</sup> + V<sup>60p+45n</sup>, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f006">Figure 6</xref>b,d represent the distribution of PseAAC and a new feature representation, respectively, obtained from T<sup>544p+544n</sup> + V<sup>60p+60n</sup> dataset.

Comparison of Meta-iAVP with the State-of-Art Predictors</title><p>To indicate the effectiveness of Meta-iAVP, we benchmarked it against the three state-of-art AVP predictors namely AVPpred [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Chang et al.&#x02019;s method [<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and AntiVPP 1.0 [<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Among the three AVP predictors, only AVPpred and Chang et al.&#x02019;s method provided the prediction results over five-fold CV and independent test results on T<sup>544p+407n</sup> + V<sup>60p+45n</sup> and T<sup>544p+544n</sup> + V<sup>60p+60n</sup>. In view of this, we only performed comparisons between Meta-iAVP with AVPpred and Chang et al.&#x02019;s method. The overall performance comparisons of Meta-iAVP with other three existing methods over five-fold CV and independent test results on T<sup>544p+407n</sup> + V<sup>60p+45n</sup> and T<sup>544p+544n</sup> + V<sup>60p+60n</sup> are shown in <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The pioneer work on the benchmark datasets was firstly reported by Thakur et al. [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Later on, Chang et al. [<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] utilized the RF model cooperating with their proposed features to enhance the prediction performance. Their prediction model yielded (89.50%, 0.79) and (93.30%, 0.87) on the independent datasets V<sup>60p+45n</sup> and V<sup>60p+60n</sup>, respectively, indicating that Chang et al.&#x02019;s method outperformed AVPpred.

Remarkably, Ac and MCC of Meta-iAVP were approximately 3.3&#x02013;11.0% and 3.0&#x02013;11.0% higher than the three state-of-art AVP predictors, thus demonstrating the superiority of our proposed predictor.</p><p>With regard to the performance comparison as discussed in the two previous sub-sections, the consistent performance comparison over five-fold CV and independent validation test demonstrates that the proposed Meta-iAVP could accurately discriminate AVPs from Non-AVPs on unknown peptides.

This model is an ensemble model consisting of many classification and regression tree (CART) classifiers to perform classification and regression tasks and improves prediction performances of CART classifiers by growing a number of weak CART classifiers. RF utilizes the concepts of bagging and random feature selection. The prediction result of the classification task is obtained by using a simple voting among outputs of all trees to get one final prediction. In regression, a final prediction is the average of prediction results of many decision trees. Herein, the RF classifier was established using the randomForest package in the R software [<xref rid="B101-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. To enhance the performance of the RF model, two parameters namely ntree (i.e., the number of tree used for constructing the RF classifier) and mtry (i.e., the number of random candidate features) were determined using the caret R package [<xref rid="B100-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] with a five-fold CV approach. The search space of ntree and mtry are (100,500) and (1,10) with the steps of 100 and 1, respectively.</p><p>XGBoost is a meta-algorithm used to construct an ensemble of strong learners from weak learners, typically decision trees, on a modified dataset [<xref rid="B103-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. XGBoost, proposed by Chen and Guestrin [<xref rid="B104-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] is a boosted tree algorithm, which follows the principle of gradient boosting. In recent years, XGBoost has been used extensively by data scientists and achieves satisfactory results on various biological problems [<xref rid="B105-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. In this study, the prediction of AVPs can be considered as a binary classification problem. Given a peptide sequence, we used XGBoost to predict its class label (&#x02212;1 or 1), where +1 and &#x02212;1 represent AVPs and Non-AVPs, respectively. For achieving the best XGBoost model, five parameters namely eta (i.e., the number of the learning rate), max_depth (i.e., the number of the depth of the tree), colsample_bytree (i.e., the number of features or variables to construct a learner), subsample (i.e., the number of samples or observations to construct a learner), and nrounds (i.e., the maximum number of iterations) were determined using the caret R package [<xref rid="B100-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] with a five-fold CV approach. The search space of eta, max_depth, colsample_bytree, subsample and nrounds are (0.3, 0.4), (1,5), (0.6,0.8), (0.500, 1.000), and (50,250) with the steps of 0.1, 1, 0.2, 0.125, and 50, respectively.</p><p>SVM method is a well-known ML algorithm based on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory of statistical learning [<xref rid="B106-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref rid="B107-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,<xref rid="B108-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], which has been widely used in various biological problems [<xref rid="B67-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B73-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B75-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B82-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B87-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B109-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,<xref rid="B110-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>].

Performance Evaluation</title><p>For the prediction problem, it is essential to determine the success and error rates of a given classifier. In practice, there are three CV methods which are traditional approaches, i.e., sub-sampling test or k-fold cross-validation (k-fold CV), jackknife test, and independent validation test or external test. Among these, the jackknife test is recognized as the least arbitrary and most objective one, as mention by equation 28&#x02013;32 in Chou [<xref rid="B81-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Meanwhile, the external test is considered as one of the most rigorous and objective methods for cross-validation in statistics. In k-fold cross-validation procedure, the training set is randomly separated into k subsets. From the k subsets, a single subset is taken as the testing set to validate the prediction model trained and learned by the remaining k-1 subsets. This process is repeated k times, until each subset had been used as the testing set. During the jackknifing process, a single sample in the whole dataset having N samples is taken as the testing set and the remaining N-1 samples are used for training the model.

Conclusions</title><p>Owing to the medical significance and potential utility of AVPs as promising antiviral drug candidates, there is intensive efforts in the development of computational models for rapidly and accurately identifying AVPs on unknown peptides. In this study, we have developed a novel meta-predictor for AVP prediction called the Meta-iAVP. In constructing this meta-predictor, a feature representation learning scheme based on six different ML algorithms and five feature types were applied in model construction. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed Meta-iAVP model based on the feature representation learning scheme over models constructed by the aforementioned ML algorithms and features. Furthermore, to confirm the effectiveness of the Meta-iAVP model, we have also performed comparative analyses with other state-of-the-art AVP predictors. It was observed from rigorous five-fold cross-validation and independent validation test that the proposed model was more effective and promising for AVPs prediction. To maximize the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, the model was deployed as a web server that also goes by the same name, Meta-iAVP, which has been made freely available at <uri xlink:href="http://codes.bio/meta-iavp/">http://codes.bio/meta-iavp/</uri>. It is anticipated that Meta-iAVP will serve as a useful, high throughput and cost-effective tool for large-scale analysis of AVPs that would help contribute to a series of interesting follow-up research studies involving antiviral peptides and other related therapeutic peptides. Although, Meta-iAVP displayed a superior performance over that of existing methods as assessed by rigorous cross-validation methods, there is still room for further improvements. For example, to improve the usefulness and efficacy for drug development and experimental research, we will make an effort to develop a computational model for predicting the inhibition of specific viruses in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the reviewers for their great comments.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>W.S. conceived, designed, performed, and analyzed the experiments.
