 <p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by infection with any of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 –DENV-4), which are transmitted in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries. The current global dengue burden, and dengue mortality, is greatest in the southeast Asian and western Pacific region where more than 70% of people at risk of infection reside. All four DENV serotypes have been reported to circulate in this region and each DENV serotype has been associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Sequential infection with heterologous DENV serotypes is associated with more severe dengue disease (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome) and co-circulation of multiple DENV serotypes is frequently observed in endemic countries. Substantial variation in local capacity for systematic surveillance and reporting among countries in the region means dengue burden is likely underestimated. We tested archival serum samples collected more than 50 years ago in Papua New Guinea in order to begin to assess the true burden of dengue, in a country where severe dengue has not been reported and DF is rare. Serological evidence for previous monotypic and multitypic DENV infection in adults living along the northeastern coast of PNG between 1959–1963 indicates dengue was transmitted prior to this period. The contribution of dengue to acute febrile illness in PNG, and the reasons for the apparent lack of severe disease, should be investigated.</p>
