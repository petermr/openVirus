HCV nucleotide sequences used in this analysis were recently deposited in Genbank. HCV-NS5b sequences were deposited with the following accession numbers: KX158877 – KX158993. Accession numbers for HCV – NS3 nucleotide sequences corresponding to PWID are: KX159080 – KX159189 and for the monoinfected patients (control group) are: KX159190 – KX159224.
