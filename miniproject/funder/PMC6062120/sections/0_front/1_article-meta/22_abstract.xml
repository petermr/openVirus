 <p>Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are among the most important of the emerging infectious disease public health problems facing the world. The actual impact of arboviruses worldwide remains unknown, and estimating the true burden of these diseases represents a current challenge. Serological surveys are the most reliable tool for estimating the impact of arboviruses outbreaks in a given territory, and the results of such surveys have implications for potential mitigation measures such as vaccination. We undertook a thorough review of the literature produced from 2000 to March 15, 2018, addressing the seroprevalence of dengue, chikungunya and/or Zika to describe and summarize methodological approaches and map the geographical distribution of seroprevalence studies for these three viruses worldwide. A total of 185 studies addressing the seroprevalence of dengue, chikungunya and/or Zika were included in the review. Most of the studies were exclusively conducted on dengue (66.5%), but 16% were exclusively conducted on chikungunya, and 7 studies were exclusively conducted on Zika; the remainder were conducted on multiple arboviruses. Our study reveals that a wide range of methodological designs were applied regarding population, recruitment and/or laboratory testing. This study also highlights the high seroprevalence heterogeneity between continents and within a given country for dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. The results underscore existing gaps in seroprevalence studies distribution worldwide and the need to develop the most sensitive and specific diagnosis tool to provide recommendations for future serological studies.</p>
