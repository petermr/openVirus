The innate immune system rapidly recognizes conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) via the presence of the host&#x02019;s own pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). At present, PRRs, which have been extensively studied, include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoid acid&#x02013;inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and DNA receptors. Studies have increasingly shown that RLRs and TLRs play an important role in the innate immunity of the organism and form the first line of defense against infectious pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Unlike TLRs and RLRs, NLRs are a recently identified large group of the intracellular PRR family characterized by multi-domain proteins, which contain an N-terminal protein-protein binding domain such as the caspase recruitment domain (CARD), pyrin (PYD), or baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR) domain, in addition to a central nucleotide oligomerization (NACHT) domain and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">However, the NLRs do not contain a signal peptide or transmembrane domain, which indicate their locations in the cytosol. The C-terminal LRR domain is the potential ligand recognition site and the NACHT domain mediates self-regulation and oligomerization. The N-terminus is responsible for protein&#x02013;protein interaction, signal transduction and initiation of the downstream immune cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Based on the specific N-terminal domain present, NLRs are divided into three subfamilies including NODs (containing the CARD domain), NALPs (containing the PYR domain) and NAIPs (containing the BIR domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Both of NOD1 and NOD2 are part of NODs subfamily with CARD, NACHT and LRR, which share three functional domains in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among them, NOD1 contains an N-terminal CARD domain, but NOD2 possesses two N- terminal CARD domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous studies have proved that NOD1 and NOD2 recognized bacterial and viral products through their C-terminal LRRs in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although the adaptive immune system of fish has well been developed, which can produce antibody response against infection. Innate immunity also plays an important role in protection against disease in fish. Some studies have found that after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (Poly (I:C)) stimulation, the expression of <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> was significantly upregulated in grouper fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], rainbow trout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], carp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], mrigal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], catfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and goldfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similar results were also found in the spleen tissue of grass carp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Upon ligand recognition, both NOD1 and NOD2 recruit RIPK to the receptors via CARD&#x02013;CARD interactions, which lead to the activation of NF-kB and MAPK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The activation of NF-kB and MAPK mediated by NOD1 and NOD2 could induce transcription and production of inflammatory mediators and antimicrobial peptides, and induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, the NOD1 and NOD2 genes play an important role in the resistance of fish to the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms.</p><p id="Par21">Among carnivorous freshwater fish, mandarinfish (<italic>Siniperca chuatsi</italic>), is a precious aquaculture species in China, with high economic value, but it is very sensitive to bacterial and viral infection. In recent years, outbreaks of disease epidemics such that of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and other epidemic diseases, such as Iridovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and EHNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], have caused serious damage to the freshwater aquaculture industry in China; however, there have been few reports of the function of NOD1 and NOD2 genes against bacteria and virus in mandarinfishes. Based on this background, we performed the molecular cloning and characterization of the mandarinfish NOD1 and NOD2 genes and analyzed their expression levels during LPS and Poly (I:C) treatment in vivo. These data might facilitate a better understanding of the role of <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> in bacterial and viral infections, which is beneficial not only to the understanding of innate immunity mechanisms in mandarinfish, but also to monitor the disease occurrence in the aquatic culture industry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissues</title><p id="Par22">A total of fifty-seven mandarinfishes with 400-600&#x000a0;g in body weight were obtained from the the Gaoyou Dongshi Special Aquatic Products Company (Yangzhou, China).

In human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the deficiency of <italic>NOD2</italic> would cause Crohn&#x02019;s disease and in grass carp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> could be upregulated by different immunostimulants. However, almost nothing is known about the homeostatic or pathogen-induced expression patterns of NLR transcripts in mandarinfish.</p><p id="Par34">To better understand the mechanism of <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> function in mandarinfish against pathogenic microorganisms, we isolated and identified the NOD1 and NOD2 cDNA sequence and characterized their sequence. The conserved domains of mandarinfish predicted by the CCD tool (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref>) showed that both of them had similar conserved domains containing CARD-NACHT-LRR domains. NOD2 had one more CARD domain than NOD1, and NOD1 had seven LRRs, whereas NOD2 only had six; however, both of them had a similar structure to grouper and miiuy croaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The high conservation of LRR domains in NOD1 and NOD2 implied that they may possess similar functional properties as those of other fishes in the recognition of pathogenic microorganisms and viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, amino acid homology analysis and phylogenetic analysis of mandarinfish NOD1 and NOD2 revealed that they shared high similarities with NOD1 and NOD2 proteins from other teleost fishes, but low similarities with those of mammals and birds. Our results showed that <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> were evolutionarily conserved not only in terms of their protein sequences but also in terms of functionally significant domains.</p><p id="Par35">In healthy mandarinfish, the NOD1 and NOD2 genes were widely expressed in all the tissues collected. RT-PCR analysis revealed that m<italic>NOD1</italic> and m<italic>NOD2</italic> mRNA were expressed at higher levels in the heart, spleen, gill, and head kidney than in other tissues, particularly in the head kidney and gill; moreover, the expression of m<italic>NOD2</italic> was generally higher than that of m<italic>NOD1</italic> in these four tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), although this result was markedly different from that observed in grouper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], grass carp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], mrigal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and channel catfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In grass carp, the highest expression of <italic>NOD1</italic> was in the liver, whereas <italic>NOD2</italic> was highly expressed in head kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In mrigal, significant expression of <italic>NOD1</italic> was detected in the liver, whereas <italic>NOD2</italic> was abundantly expressed, with the highest levels observed in spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As an important immune organ of fish, the head kidney has high expression levels of <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic>, which is to be expected. In addition to the important immune organ, scattered lymphocyte germinal centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] are found in the mucous tissues of the gills, indicated that the gill might function as the first line of defense in the innate immune response, and high levels of NOD1 and NOD2 gene expression in the gill is also expected. Besides, the NOD1 and NOD2 genes of mandarinfish were also observed to be expressed at high levels in head kidney, speculating that <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> may take part in the anti-pathogen response.</p><p id="Par36">NODs are a recently characterized group of pathogen recognition receptors, they are believed to be intracellular bacteria-recognizing receptor. The bacterial component, LPS, has been shown to influence NOD1 and NOD2 mRNA expression in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], rohu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and channel catfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In channel catfish, after bacterial induction, <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> were highly upregulated in head kidney and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A significant observation in this study was that the expression of NOD1 and NOD2 genes were upregulated in vivo following LPS stimulation, suggesting the involvement of these genes in antibacterial response. In addition, mandarinfish <italic>NOD2</italic> was activated to a greater extent, but <italic>NOD1</italic> peaked earlier than <italic>NOD2</italic> after LPS induction in spleen, gill and head kidney, indicating that <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> appear to play a unique role in initially sensing pathogenic and may work in different response time in defense against bacterial invasion.</p><p id="Par37">In addition, some studies have showed that <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> could prove to participate in antiviral defense, such as human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], olive flounder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], rohu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], grouper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and grass carp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In human, <italic>NOD1</italic> was significantly induced following stimulation with human cytomegalovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and in grass carp activation of <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> was reported in reovirus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In mandarinfish, both the NOD1 and NOD2 gene were found to be activated in viral infection, mimicked by treatment with the viral analogue Poly I:C, revealing that NODs are sensitive to the protective immune response against viral invasion. Interestingly, mandarinfish <italic>NOD2</italic> showed a more significant increasement when stimulated by PolyI:C than did <italic>NOD1</italic> in vivo, however, <italic>NOD1</italic> showed significantly higher expression at 24&#x000a0;h post infection in spleen and gill during PolyI:C stimulation, demonstrating that mandarinfish <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> may act differently within different tissues in antiviral defense. In addition, the expression levels of m<italic>NOD1</italic> and m<italic>NOD2</italic> mRNA after LPS stimulation generally peaked at an earlier time point than that observed with Poly (I:C) treatment, revealing that both of them were more sensitive to the antibacterial sensitive response than to viral invasion, indicating that these proteins more easily identify bacterial peptidoglycans and induce signaling pathways by acting as PRRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], meanwhile, some other subfamilies of NOD-like receptors may be responsible for inducing <italic>mNOD1</italic> and <italic>mNOD2</italic> in response to LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which needs further studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par38">In summary, we first cloned and characterized the NOD1 and NOD2 cDNA sequences in mandarinfish, and demonstrated that the mandarinfish NOD1 and NOD2 genes are functionally similar to their counterparts from other teleosts. Transcriptional analysis showed ubiquitous expression of NOD1 and NOD2 gene in seven examined tissues. Expression analyses showed that NOD1 and NOD2 gene were significantly enhanced in vivo after LPS or Poly (I:C) stimulation, indicating that <italic>NOD1</italic> and <italic>NOD2</italic> may appear to play a unique role in initially sensing pathogenic and may work in different tissues in defense against bacterial and viral invasion. Taken together, our results revealed that the m<italic>NOD1</italic> and m<italic>NOD2</italic> might be involved in innate immune protection in mandarinfish.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
