 <p>For communicable infections, variations in contact rates determine the flow of disease through populations. Therefore, describing contact patterns within populations could help to better predict and prevent disease outbreaks. Free-ranging domestic dogs are susceptible to a number of zoonotic infections yet few studies have investigated their contact patterns. We describe high-resolution contact data for free-ranging dogs in rural Chad and simulate the transmission of an infection comparable to rabies. We show that epidemic outcomes are determined by the seeded individual’s network position, which was also correlated with ranging behaviour. This demonstrates that between-individual variation in the risks of spreading infection may be linked with observable traits that can help inform targeted management strategies.</p>
