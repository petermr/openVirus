 <p>Dengue is a major public health problem worldwide. The burden of dengue in Latin America is been increasing in the last years and Mexico is one of the countries with the highest burden in this region. To better understand the transmission of dengue in Mexico we established a school-based prospective cohort study of dengue virus infection in children and their families in three cities in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. In this article we show that around 70% of the cohort population has prior immunity to dengue. Also that the rate of dengue cases varied among cities and we also confirm the circulation of chikungunya and Zika virus in the cohort participants during the first year of follow-up. We found evidence that having prior dengue immunity might protect again Zika symptomatic infections. The results of this study will be useful for the scientific community and policy makers from Mexico and other countries in Latin America to properly plan and evaluate control strategies and interventions like vector control and vaccines.</p>
