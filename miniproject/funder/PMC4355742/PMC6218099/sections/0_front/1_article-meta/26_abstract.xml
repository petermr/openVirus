 <p>Dengue virus (DENV) is the leading cause of arboviral diseases in humans worldwide. In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence of DENV infection in two districts of Kaohsiung City, a metropolis in southern Taiwan, where major dengue outbreaks have occurred in the past three decades. We enrolled 1,088 participants from the Sanmin and Nanzih districts after the dengue outbreak of 2015, the largest in Taiwan since World War II, and found an overall DENV seroprevalence of 12.4% (95% confidence interval: 10.5–13.4%) based on the InBios DENV IgG ELISA kit. The ratios of clinically inapparent to symptomatic infections were 2.86 and 4.76 in Sanmin and Nanzih districts, respectively. Consistent with higher case numbers during recent outbreaks, the DENV seroprevalence was higher in Sanmin district (16.4%) than in Nanzih district (6.9%), suggesting district differences in seroprevalence and highlighting the importance of screening the DENV immune status of each individual before using the currently available DENV vaccine, Dengvaxia. In the two districts, the seroprevalence rates increased from 2.1% (in the 30–39-year age group) to 17.1% (60–69) and 50% (70–79). The pattern of a sharp and significant increase in seroprevalence in the 70–79-year age group correlated with a dramatic increase in the proportion of clinically severe DENV infections among total dengue cases in that age group. This differed from observations in the Americas and Southeast Asia and suggested that a large proportion of monotypically immune individuals together with other risk factors may contribute to clinically severe dengue among the elderly in Taiwan.</p>
