The parameters of a population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates, reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time. Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance, however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological processes. This approach builds upon previous structured coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is described for translating parametric demographic or epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza A virus sequence data, demonstrating how important features of these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic curves, can be gleaned from genetic data. These approaches are provided as an open-source package <italic>PhyDyn</italic> for the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01GM110749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6268-8937</contrib-id><name><surname>Volz</surname><given-names>Erik M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>EMV and IS were supported by NIGMS MIDAS grant U01GM110749 and the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis.

Parameters estimated by fitting mechanistic models, such as the reproduction number <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, are important for epidemic surveillance and forecasting. Compartmental models defined in terms of ordinary or stochastic differential equations are the most common type of mathematical infectious disease model, but in the area of phylodynamic inference, non-parametric approaches such as skyline coalescent models [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or sampling-birth-death models [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] are more commonly used. Methods to translate compartmental infectious disease models into a population genetic framework have been developed only recently [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We address the gap in software tools for epidemic modeling and phylogenetic inference by developing a BEAST2 package, <italic>PhyDyn</italic>, which includes a highly-flexible markup language for defining compartmental infectious disease models in terms of ordinary differential equations. This flexible framework enables phylodynamic inference with the majority of published compartmental models, such as the common susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and its variants, which are often fitted to non-genetic surveillance data. The <italic>PhyDyn</italic> model definition framework supports common mathematical functions, conditional logic, vectorized parameters and the definition of complex functions of time and/or state of the system. The <italic>PhyDyn</italic> package can make use of categorical metadata associated with each sampled sequences, such as location of sampling, demographic attributes of an infected patient (age, sex), or clinical biomarkers. Phylogeographic models designed to estimate migration rates between spatial demes [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] are special cases within this modeling framework, and more complex phylogeographic models (e.g. time-varying or state-dependent population size or migration rates) can also be easily defined in this framework.</p><p>The development of <italic>PhyDyn</italic> was influenced by and builds upon previous efforts to incorporate mechanistic infectious disease models in BEAST2. The <italic>bdsir</italic> BEAST2 package [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] implements a simple SIR model which is fitted using an approximation to the sampling-birth-death process. The <italic>phylodynamics</italic> BEAST2 package [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] includes simple deterministic and stochastic SIR models which can be fitted using coalescent processes. More recently, the <italic>EpiInf</italic> package has been developed which can fit stochastic SIR models using an exact likelihood with particle filtering [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These epidemic modeling packages are, however, limited to unstructured populations (no spatial, risk-group, or demographic population heterogeneity). Other packages have been developed for spatially structured populations with a focus on phylogeographic inference, especially with the aim of estimating pathogen migration rates between discrete spatial locations [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The <italic>MultiTypeTree</italic> BEAST2 package [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] implements the exact structured coalescent model with multiple demes and with constant effective population size in each deme and constant migration rates between demes. Two BEAST2 packages, <italic>BASTA</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and <italic>MASCOT</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been independently developed to use fast approximate structured coalescent models. These packages mirror the functionality of <italic>MultiTypeTree</italic> but include approximations to reduce computational requirements, enabling estimation of time-invariant effective population sizes and migration rates between spatial demes.</p><p>The <italic>PhyDyn</italic> BEAST2 package provides new functionality to the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform by implementing a much more complex family of structured coalescent models. In a general compartmental model, neither the effective population size nor migration rate between demes need be constant, and in more general frameworks, coalescence is also allowed between lineages occupying different demes. The package includes a flexible markup language for defining compartmental models within the BEAST2 XML. This includes common mathematical functions making it simple to develop models which incorporate seasonality or which deviate from the simplistic mass-action premise of basic SIR models. Models defined with this special syntax can be directly incorporated into BEAST2 XML files for easily reproducing and modifying analyses. The <italic>PhyDyn</italic> model markup language supports vectorised parameters (e.g. an array of transmission rates or population sizes) and simple conditional logic statements, so that epidemic dynamics can change in a discrete fashion, such as from year to year or in response to a public-health intervention. Commonly used phylogeographic models based on the structured coalescent are a special case of the general compartmental models implemented in the <italic>PhyDyn</italic> package, and extensions to the basic phylogeographic model can be implemented, such as by allowing effective population size to vary through time in each deme according to a mechanistic model.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Design and implementation</title><p>In this framework, first described in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we define deterministic demographic or epidemiological processes of a general form which includes the majority of compartmental models used in mathematical epidemiology and ecology. Defining compartmental models within this form facilitates interpretation of the population genetic model developed in the next section.

In the following sections, we give examples of simple compartmental models related to infectious diease dynamics and show how these models can be defined within this framework and code samples are also provided online. We provide examples of models fitted to data from seasonal human Influenza virus and Ebola virus as well as a simulation study.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Seasonal human influenza model</title><p>We model a single season of Influenza A virus (IAV) H3N2 and apply this model to 102 HA-1 sequences collected between 2004 and 2005 in New York state [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We build on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model which accounts for importations of lineages from the global reservoir of IAV, which we will see is a requirement for good model fit to these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006546.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This model has two demes: The first deme corresponds to IAV lineages circulating in New York, and the second deme corresponds to the global IAV reservoir. The global reservoir will be modeled as a constant-size coalescent process.

In BEAST2, the coalescent likelihood is used in tandem with evolutionary models that provide the probability density of a genealogy given a genetic sequence alignment and evolutionary parameters. But the coalescent likelihood can also be used if a time-scaled phylogeny has been estimated independently.</p><p>Various approximations have been developed for computing the density of a genealogy conditional on a complex demographic history. These differ by the extent to which they account for correlation between co-existing lineages in the genealogy, the extent to which they account for finite size of the population, and the extent to which they account for differences in coalescent rates in different demes. There is a speed/bias tradeoff between these approximations, and consequently <italic>PhyDyn</italic> makes several model variations available. The choice of likelihood approximation depends on time and computational resources available, sample size, and model complexity. Three likelihood approximations are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006546.s001">S1 Text</xref>, and we derive a new approximation which has shown greater accuracy in some situations.</p><p>The structured coalescent model in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which inspired the development of <italic>PhyDyn</italic> did not account for all correlations between co-existing lineages or all effects stemming from disparate coalescent rates between demes. In [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a fast likelihood approximation was derived which better accounted for potential bias resulting from highly-disparate coalescent rates in different demes. This model, denoted <italic>QL</italic>, also makes strong approximations regarding lineage independence: In every internode interval, all lineages are updated according to a linear transformation which varies through time but not between lineages. These issues were investigated as a source of bias in the context of phylogeographic models in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], where yet another likelihood approximation was proposed for models with constant population size and constant migration rates.</p><p>In the PhyDyn package, we have developed likelihood approximations based on <italic>QL</italic> which better account for correlation between lineages.

While these models are demonstrably more accurate in simulation studies, they require more computation. All three likelihood approximations are provided in the PhyDyn package.

The <italic>PhyDyn</italic> package greatly expands the range of epidemiological, ecological, and phylogeographic models that can be fitted within the BEAST2 Bayesian phylogenetics framework. Extensions enabled by this package include models with parametric seasonal forcing, non-constant parametric migration or coalescent rates between demes, state-dependent migration or coalescent rates, and discrete changes in migration or coalescent rates in response to perturbation of the system (e.g. a public health intervention). The package also provides a means of utilizing non-geographic categorical metadata which is usually not considered in phylodynamic analyses, such as clinical or demographic attributes of patients in a viral phylodynamics application [<xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>We have demonstrated the utility of this framework using data from Influenza and Ebola virus epidemics in humans, finding epidemic parameters and epidemic trajectories consistent with other surveillance data. In both of these examples, simple structured models were fitted, but notably without using any categorical metadata associated with sampled sequences. This demonstrates potential advantages of structured coalescent modeling even in the absence of informative metadata. In the case of human Influenza A virus, the fitted model included a deme which accounted for evolution in the unsampled global influenza reservoir, which allowed estimation of epidemic parameters within the smaller sub-region which was intensively sampled. The use of a parametric mass-action model allowed <italic>PhyDyn</italic> to correctly detect the time of epidemic peak and epidemic decline, whereas non-parametric skyline methods did not detect epidemic decline in this case. And in the application to the Ebola virus epidemic in Western Africa, models included un-sampled &#x02018;exposed&#x02019; categories which accounted for realistic progression of disease among patients, as well as a &#x02018;super-spreading&#x02019; compartment which accounted for over-dispersion in the number of transmissions per infected case.</p><p>In developing <italic>PhyDyn</italic>, the focus has been on developing a highly flexible framework which is also computationally tractable for moderate sample sizes and model complexity. But flexibility and computational efficiency has come at the cost of some realism, notably in the deterministic nature of the models included in this framework.
