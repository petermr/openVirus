 <p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease whose global incidence has increased dramatically in recent decades. Infection with any of the four serotypes can cause subclinical to life-threatening illness. Indonesia and other subtropical regions are hyper-endemic, thus are at increased risk of disease impact. We conducted a multicenter observational cohort study of acute febrile illness requiring hospitalization in children and adults in Indonesia from 2013–2016. Epidemiology, clinical course, and virology of dengue were assessed. Dengue infection is the main cause of hospitalized acute febrile illness in Indonesia. DENV serotypes 1–4 circulated throughout the study period, with highest overall rates in January to March. We observed DENV-1 with TS1
  <sub>19</sub>(C→T) substitution in the serotyping primer annealing site that caused failure of routine detection. Diagnostic accuracy at clinical sites merits optimization. Clinicians should consider following diagnostic algorithms that include DENV confirmatory testing, while policy-makers should prioritize development of laboratory capacity for diagnosis of DENV.
