infectious disease incidence. Here we develop such a system to study and forecast respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection and bronchiolitis. Advanced warning of the epidemic timing and volume of RSV patient surges has the potential to reduce well-documented delays of treatment in emergency departments. We use a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model in conjunction with an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) and ten years of regional U.S. specimen data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data and EAKF are used to optimize the SIR model and i) estimate critical epidemiological parameters over the course of each outbreak and ii) generate retrospective forecasts. The basic reproductive number, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, is estimated at 3.0 (standard deviation 0.6) across all seasons and locations. The peak magnitude of RSV outbreaks is forecast with nearly 70% accuracy (i.e. nearly 70% of forecasts within 25% of the actual peak), four weeks before the predicted peak. This work represents a first step in the development of a real-time RSV prediction system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection and bronchiolitis. Prompt treatment of RSV is necessary to prevent damage to lung tissue, complications from prolonged oxygen deprivation, and the potential development of reactive airway disorders. Another respiratory disease, influenza, has been simulated and forecast with high accuracy, using an epidemiological model and data assimilation methods. Here, we adapt such a model-filter system to simulate and forecast RSV epidemics in the United States. We find that the timing and volume of RSV epidemics can be forecast with high accuracy.

The rate of hospitalization for RSV infection, estimated at 1.3&#x02013;3% for children under four [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is greatest in infants younger than three months old [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whose immune response can inundate and block smaller airways, leading to wheezing and difficulty breathing. Infants at risk for developing severe RSV infection are injected with the antibody prophylaxis palivizumab each month prior to anticipated RSV exposure. Palivizumab is highly rationed, primarily because of its high cost, so the scheduling of immunoprophylaxis is very important [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; however, even though RSV activity cycles seasonally, the precise timing and magnitude of RSV incidence varies each year. This variability not only complicates effective infant dosing of immunoprophylaxis but also may contribute to well-documented delays in emergency departments (ED) [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. RSV infections constitute 2% of hospital patients under age one on an annual basis [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and often coincide with the influenza season.</p><p>The toll of RSV on the elderly is also high. RSV hospitalization rates in New York City are 1.5 times greater for individuals 75 and older than for 1-4-year-olds [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Older patients account for 25% of all ED visits [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and as populations in the developed world age, the proportion of elderly in the ED, some infected with RSV, is likely to grow. Indeed, ED crowding has been linked to delays in treatment and reduced efficacy of care for asthma and respiratory distress [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Prompt administration of oxygen is key to the treatment of bronchiolitis, although the minimum level of oxygen saturation (SO<sub>2</sub>) recommended for children varies from 90%&#x02013;95% [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Children with prolonged oxygen deprivation in the range 90%&#x02013;94% SO<sub>2</sub>, due to a variety of causes, were found to be at risk for long-lasting cognitive damage and associated behavioral issues [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The immune response to bronchiolitis can in some cases damage lung tissue [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Accurate forecasts of RSV incidence could thus be used by health care management to develop data-driven strategies that are more effective and better timed for patient demand [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Here we present the development and validation of a model-inference system for forecasting the timing and magnitude of RSV outbreaks.</p><p>The core component of our forecasting system is a dynamic model describing the propagation of RSV through a simulated population. Many of the dynamic models previously developed for simulation of RSV are compartmental constructs that divide a population into the different states associated with the chain of infection: susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR), as well as constructs additionally accounting for partial immunity (SIRS) and exposure (SEIRS) [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Epidemiological parameters within these model structures govern the rates of transition between compartments. Typically, such parameters are either designated <italic>a priori</italic> based on clinical and laboratory estimates, or estimated from historical incidence, using a compartmental model structure and transmission dynamics. RSV parameter estimates derived using these different methods or data, however, can vary widely. For example, the parameter that represents the duration of infection, <italic>D</italic>, has been identified variously through antigen detection as 6.7 days [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], using RT-PCR assay as 11.2 days [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and as nearly three months in immunocompromised individuals [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, for the basic reproductive number, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, one study in Florida found mean <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> values of 1.7 and 7.4 using an SIRS model and modified SEIRS model, respectively [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while others in the same state found a mean <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> above 9 using a SIRS that accounted for repeated infections, waning immunity, and/or age structure [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Much of this variation reflects the use of different model structures, and in part it may stem from the quality, abundance, and spatial and temporal resolution of the RSV data used to make these inferences.</p><p>Here, the same model-inference system developed for the generation of RSV forecasts is also used to infer critical RSV epidemiological parameters. We apply this system at a broad scale using regional RSV data from the U.S. and in so doing attempt to further resolve RSV parameter estimates. To perform this work, and as has been performed for other infectious disease systems [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we combine a simple dynamical disease transmission model with a data assimilation filter that updates the model state variables and parameters using time series observations. Here, we present this RSV model-filter system, the resulting parameter estimates, and retrospective forecasts generated for the United States. We have built this predictive system for a variety of RSV data streams. It can be deployed at the beginning of the annual RSV wintertime season and used to help reduce delays in health care and enable broader access to preventative medication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Data</title><p>RSV specimen data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These data, sampled via antigen detection, viral isolation, and polymerase chain reaction, are collected and administered by laboratories and other medical facilities that participate in the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). The number of samples tested for RSV each week and the number of positive results were recorded, since July 2004 at the census division and Health and Human Services (HHS) region geographic scales (the states in each regional classification system are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s014">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s015">S2</xref> Tables). The RSV season runs from week 27 (around July 10<sup>th</sup>) through week 26 of the following year, with at least 20 tests per week during this season. Over the first ten weeks of the RSV season, incidence is low and testing is often limited; consequently, we omitted these first ten weeks and began all simulations on week 37, in mid-September, when the number of RSV tests administered typically begins to rise. To scale the number of positive tests to regions with very different reporting magnitudes, we divide by the number of laboratories reporting to each region each season. With these data, we estimated RSV incidence over nine census divisions, ten HHS regions, and ten RSV seasons.

As a consequence, we use a simpler, perfectly-mixed compartmental model to describe RSV transmission dynamics. Furthermore, each RSV location and season is simulated and forecast independently. While reinfection with RSV is common, RSV antibodies only decline by 25&#x02013;30% per year [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], indicating that waning immunity and consequent reinfection within the time frame of a single season is not likely to be significant [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

This latter finding enables distinction of forecast reliability in real time.</p><p>The improvement over historical expectance is particularly important. The scaled RSV positive data used in this study varies in magnitude substantially from year-to-year; however, the observed mean error for peak timing is only about 1.5 weeks and thus fairly regular, allowing reasonable forecast with the historical mean. Still the model-filter forecasts exceed the accuracy of the historical mean more than two weeks prior to the predicted peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005133.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In addition, the improvement of the model-filter forecasts over the historical mean predictions, as measured by the difference in error, is correlated with observed standard deviation within a region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s013">S13 Fig</xref>); for example, model-filter forecasts of epidemic peak magnitude provide a greater reduction of error in regions with greater standard deviation of peak magnitude. Thus, regions with greater observed variability see a greater improvement of forecast accuracy from the model-filter system over historical expectance.</p><p>RSV patients in medical care are overwhelmingly the very young and the elderly, because of the small size of their lungs or less-effective immune response [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

As the NREVSS data do not include age-stratified infection, we were unable to simulate these differences and instead used a single age class model. Should age-stratified infection data become available, future work should explore forecast and parameter estimation with an age-stratified model.

Forecast accuracy did not differ appreciably between census divisions and HHS regions. By simulating both regional grouping systems, we further demonstrate the reliability of our results.

The mean value of <italic>D</italic>, the duration of infection, just over 6 days, is also within the range modeled variously as 5&#x02013;11 days. In our SIR model, the duration of infection functions as the duration of infectiousness, which in our model-filter may vary by time or by region depending on norms such as the time to treatment or isolation of symptomatic individuals.

Without widespread RSV testing, the efficacy of an RSV vaccine, several of which are currently under development [<xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], may be more difficult to determine. Further, testing would support both study and forecast of RSV. For example, RSV data derived from testing of bronchiolitis patients and active sampling, the latter used to estimate RSV incidence across all age groups, would support development of more complicated model structures, which could be used to generate age-stratified forecasts. Ideally, these forecasts would influence individual behavior and improve health care preparedness, and thus would serve as a bulwark against bronchiolitis.</p><p>In summary, advanced warning of RSV infections can reduce delays in the care of RSV patients, who are predominantly infants and the elderly, and hence vulnerable to lingering damage to lung tissue and other negative outcomes from RSV. Our model-filter system replicates the seasonal dynamics of RSV throughout the United States, and our forecasts predict multiple outcomes, including epidemic peak magnitude with more than 60% accuracy five weeks prior to the predicted peak. Importantly, the high accuracy of forecasts predicting epidemic onset one month in advance could allow doctors to better ration the delivery of palivizumab prophylaxis. Further, the near-linear increase in accuracy with decreasing ensemble variance provides a metric of certainty for each forecast. Our results provide evidence that levels of RSV incidence can be anticipated in time to inform the distribution of prophylactics and deployment of other protective measures against RSV infection. However, real-time predictions will require that laboratory testing for RSV be resumed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1005133.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Scaled RSV for the nine U.S. Census Divisions and ten RSV seasons.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1005133.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1005133.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>A histogram of actual peak timing for each census division and year.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1005133.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1005133.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>The overall RMSE between the observations and forecasts shown for two &#x003b3; and OEV combinations.</title><p>The variable OEV was computed with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005133.e005">Eq 4</xref>, with <italic>OEV</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> and <italic>a</italic> equal to 10<sup>4</sup> and 50, respectively.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1005133.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1005133.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Scatterplot of simulated RSV infections versus observed infections for the 9 census divisions and all 10 seasons, multiplied by &#x003b3;N as described in the text.</title><p>The red line is 1:1.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1005133.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1005133.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Estimates of the parameters <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> and <italic>D</italic> shown as a time series during the 20 weeks of forecast.</title><p>All regions and seasons are shown.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1005133.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1005133.s006"><label>S6 Fig</label><caption><title>Boxplots of weekly <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> estimates for each census division across all 10 seasons.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1005133.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1005133.s007"><label>S7 Fig</label><caption><title>The mean values of <italic>D</italic> and <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> for RSV for each year and census division.</title><p>These estimates remain similar from year to year and location.
