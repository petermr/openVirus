The disease caused by chikungunya virus typically resolves itself within weeks, but may be persistent and more severe in elderly individuals. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines, although a virus-like particle vaccine is currently being tested in Phase II clinical trials. In this study, we formulated chikungunya virus-like particles with adjuvants to skew and enhance the immune responses against chikungunya, and vaccinated adult and aged mice. Our aim was to identify a vaccine formulation that would protect adult and elderly populations. Results showed that the unadjuvanted vaccine was very effective in adult mice, eliciting strong virus-neutralizing antibody titers, and protecting mice against chikungunya infection and disease. In contrast, chikungunya disease was exacerbated in mice vaccinated with the virus-like particle vaccine alone or with QuilA adjuvant. This study highlights the need for an improved vaccine approach to safely and effectively vaccinate the elderly against chikungunya viral infections.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI124132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1947-7469</contrib-id><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>Ted M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Georgia Research Alliance</institution></funding-source><award-id>GRA-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1947-7469</contrib-id><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>Ted M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Center for Vaccines and Immunology and by NIAID/NIH R21AI124132.

CHIKV was first discovered in Tanzania in 1952, but outbreaks became more widespread, encompassing countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans before emerging in the Americas in 2013 [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. More recently, in 2016&#x02013;2017, there has been a resurgence of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in India [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Pakistan [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and Italy [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Chikungunya infection results in illness, in which fever and joint polyalrthralgia, are typically reported symptoms [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Acute symptoms persist for two weeks, but more chronic arthralgias may persist for months to years in a subset of subjects. More severe and/or chronic chikungunya illnesses were first widely reported in retrospective studies of the chikungunya epidemics of Reunion Island [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and India [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Following infection, patients experience renal, respiratory, hepatic, and cardiovascular system failures. In addition, diseases of the central nervous disease and encephalitis are major areas of concerns [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. People over 60 years of age are at particular risk for severe chikungunya-associated illnesses, with case fatalities reported [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the incidence of CHIKV infection in this population is not remarkable in comparison to other age groups [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The specific mechanisms that lead to increased severity of CHIKV illness in the elderly are not known, but increased understanding could lead to better treatments and vaccines for this at-risk population.</p><p>Vaccinating elderly individuals presents a special challenge since they are more prone to severe illness and vaccine efficacy drops in this population [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The age-associated changes in the immune system are collectively termed immunosenescence and include fewer circulating antigen presenting cells and tissue-associated dendritic cells, decreased phagocytosis, decreased toll-like receptor signaling, reduced na&#x000ef;ve B and T cells, and chronic basal level of inflammation [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Elements of the immune system that remain intact include tissue macrophages and CD8+ T cell-mediated responses [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Different vaccine approaches to counter immunosenescence in the aging include the use of higher vaccine doses, booster vaccinations, adjuvants, and vector-based vaccines [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many vaccine delivery platforms are in development for a chikungunya vaccine, including formalin-inactivated viral vaccines, live-attenuated viruses, chimeric alphaviruses, DNA-based vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, and virus-like particle [VLP]-based vaccines [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The most promising candidates, including a non-adjuvanted CHIK VLP vaccine, are being tested in Phase I and II clinical trials in adults between the ages of 18&#x02013;60 years of age [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, we will continue to have a gap in knowledge regarding 1) CHIKV vaccine efficacy in the elderly and 2) understanding the vaccine characteristics needed to elicit a protective immune response in this population.</p><p>In this study, CHIKV virus-like particles were adjuvanated and used to vaccinate adult and aged mice. Adjuvants were chosen for their abilities to not only enhance, but skew immune responses. The goal was to identify a CHIK VLP vaccine formulation that would protect both adult and aged mice populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Expression of Chikungunya E1, E2, and VLPs</title><p>The complete sequence encoding structural proteins (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) of the Chikungunya virus S27 strain [accession #AF369024] was codon-optimized for expression in <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> and synthesized by Genewiz [South Plainfield, NJ, USA]. The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA] was subsequently used to generate recombinant baculoviruses expressing CHIKV structural proteins. Briefly, the structural gene sequence was inserted into the pFastBac1 vector, under the control of the <italic>Autographa californica</italic> multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) polyhedrin for high-level expression in insect cells. The CHIK C-E VLP/pFastBac1 construct was then transformed into DH10Bac <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, where C-E genes flanked between mini-Tn7 sites on the pFastBac1 plasmid and the LacZ gene flanked between mini-<italic>att</italic>Tn7 target sites on a AcMNPV bacmid are transposed to generate recombinant bacmid. The presence of C-E genes was verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using primers that hybridize to sites flanking the mini-<italic>att</italic>Tn7 site: pUC/M13 forward 5&#x02019;-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG-3&#x02019; and pUC/M13 reverse 5&#x02019;-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3&#x02019;. Baculovirus was generated and passaged in Sf9 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>frugiperda</italic> insect cells, maintained in serum-free, SF900 II SFM medium [Thermo Fisher Scientific]. To generate the initial recombinant viruses, 8&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> Sf9 cells per well were seeded onto a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere for 15 min. The cells were then transfected with 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g bacmids using Cellfectin transfection reagent [Thermo Fisher Scientific]. The cells were observed for cytopathic effect and supernatants were harvested and clarified after 72h post-infection. The P1 virus was then passaged in a 30ml, spinner-flask culture of Sf9 cells at a cell density of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> c/ml, and harvested 72h post-infection to generate P2 virus. For expression, Sf9 cells were cultured in spinner flasks to a density of 2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> c/ml in a total volume of 250 ml and infected with recombinant baculovirus at a MOI of 1. Cultures were harvested once cell viability was reduced to roughly 80% or 72-96h after infection, and the cells were pelleted at 500&#x000d7;g for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.22&#x003bc;m pore membrane before sedimentation via ultracentrifugation. CHIK virus-like particles (VLP) were sedimented through a 20% glycerol cushion at 100,000&#x000d7;g for 4h. The sedimented VLP pellets were resuspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Similarly, E1 and E2 genes, designed as transmembrane-truncated versions, were synthesized and cloned into the pFastBac HT vector. The pFastBac HT vector adds an N-terminal 6&#x000d7;His tag and and tobacco etch virus (TEV) proteolytic site to each gene. Recombinant bacmids and baculoviruses were generated as described above and soluble E1 and E2 proteins were expressed in Sf9 spinner flask cultures.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Soluble E1 and E2 protein purification</title><p>The cultures containing soluble E1 and E2 proteins were harvested and cells were sedimented at 500&#x000d7;g for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.22&#x003bc;m pore membrane and the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin [Thermo Fisher Scientific]. Briefly, the clarified cultures were incubated with Ni-NTA resin with shaking for 2.5-3h at room temperature before they were added to the columns. The medium was allowed to flow through and the Ni-NTA resin was washed three times with PBS containing 10mM imidazole. His-tagged proteins were then eluted twice with PBS containing 250mM imidazole. Upon verification of eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE analysis, E1 and E2 proteins were dialyzed and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters [Millipore, Burlington, MA] with a 10 KDa molecular weight cut-off and sterile 10% glycerol in PBS as the exchange buffer.

Next, the proteins were transferred from the gels onto PVDF membranes using the Trans Blot Turbo apparatus [Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA]. The membranes were blocked for 5&#x02013;10 min in iBind solution [Novex]. Polyclonal mouse anti-E1 and anti-E2 sera were recovered from mice vaccinated with E1 or E2 proteins in the lab and used to probe for these proteins.

These vaccines 1] are overall safe and tolerable, and 2] elicit CHIKV neutralization titers in adults 18&#x02013;50 years of age. These two candidates are now being tested in healthy adults of 18&#x02013;60 years of age in five Caribbean island nations. Based on results from Phase I trials, at least two immunizations with the live-vectored or CHIK VLPs are needed for 100% seronconversion and induction of neutralizing antibodies in healthy adult subjects [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The goals of our study were to improve these vaccines by adding adjuvants, and also show that these formulations would be efficacious in an aged model of infection. R848/resiquimod was used as a TLR7/8 agonist to induce a Th1 biased response [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Imject Alum induces primarily a Th2 biased response [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and QuilA was selected because it enhances T-dependent and T-independent immune responses [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In adult mice, CHIK VLP administered alone or with QuilA administered by IM elicited strong antibody responses that were neutralizing <italic>in vitro</italic>, and these vaccines protected 100% of mice against CHIKV challenge, as determined by lack of swelling of the injected foot, lack of weight loss, and lack of viral titers.</p><p>Antibodies play a critical role in the clearance of CHIKV infections by both neutralizing virus infection and enhancing the clearance of virally infected cells [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Potent neutralizing antibodies, composed of multiple subclasses, are directed against the E2 protein [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Early induction of anti-CHIKV anti-E2 human IgG3 subclass antibodies successfully clear CHIKV infections and lead to faster recovery. In adult mice, the most effective vaccine candidates were CHIK VLPs with no adjuvant or VLP plus QuilA, both administered by IM injections. Both of these vaccine formulations elicited antibodies directed against both the E1 and E2 proteins. A combination of robust IgG1, IgG2c, and IgG3 anti-E1 responses were detected [<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g002">Fig 2F&#x02013;2H</xref></bold>]. In contrast, IgG3 antibodies were the predominant anti-E2 response elicited by these vaccines, with lower titers of pro-inflammatory IgG2c elicited by VLP alone or IgG1 by VLP vaccines formulated with QuilA [<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g002">Fig 2J&#x02013;2L</xref></bold>]. Mouse IgG3, which is not a homolog of human IgG3, is induced independently of T-cell help and appears shortly after vaccination [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This anti-CHIKV IgG3 response may enhance clearance of CHIKV infected cells in adult mice, since CD4 knockout mice are still able to control and clear CHIK virus as effectively as wild-type mice [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In contrast, B cell deficient mice (&#x003bc;MT) remain persistently infected [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Mouse IgG3 binds Fc&#x003b3;RI, but is thought to function primarily through activation of complement [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These anti-E1 and anti-E2 responses were absent in aged mice vaccinated with CHIK VLPs or VLP plus QuilA. The sera from aged mice vaccinated did react with whole VLP preparations by ELISA, with similar levels of anti-VLP IgG1 as the adult mice. Perhaps the presence of these antibodies that did not bind specifically to soluble E1 or E2, contributed to CHIKV disease enhancement in these animals. A phenomenon coined antibody-dependendent enhancement has been described for dengue and other viruses whereby non-neutralizing antibodies facilitate entry of antibody-bound virions via Fc&#x003b3;R [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Antibody-dependent enhancement has also been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> with another alphavirus, Ross River Virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A more recent study shows that convalescent sera from CHIKV-infected subjects mediates enhanced binding, but not enhanced replication of CHIKV in primary human monocytes and B cells <italic>in vitro</italic> via Fc&#x003b3;Rs [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast, increased chikungunya viral replication is observed in Raw 264.7 mouse macrophages in the presence of mouse anti-CHIKV IgG <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mice infected with CHIKV and then treated with subneutralizing levels of anti-CHIKV IgG also develop higher levels of viremia and disease as measured by foot swelling [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Another unexpected feature of the aged mice was their resistance to chikungunya viral infection and disease [<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g005">Fig 5</xref></bold>]. We speculate that this resistance may be associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines present in aged mice, but not in adult mice. Chronic, low-level inflammation associated with aging has been coined &#x0201c;inflammaging&#x0201d;. The elevation of some cytokines, such as IL-6, are associated with longevity, while elevation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, are associated with higher rates of mortality in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The role of inflammaging is complicated because while enhanced inflammation leads to disease, mortality, and poor vaccine outcomes, inflammation can help the immune system resist virally-induced disease [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Healthy aged mice with detectable levels of inflammatory markers TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 [<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref></bold>] were resistant to CHIKV-associated disease [<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g004">Fig 4B &#x00026; 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g005">Fig 5</xref>]</bold>. Furthermore, addition of exogenous TNF-&#x003b1; to Vero cells inhibited CHIKVinfection <italic>in vitro</italic>, based on reduction in CPE. Future studies testing the effects of exogenous TNF-alpha on CHIK viral infections <italic>in vivo</italic> would help to corroborate these results.</p><p>Basal inflammation in the na&#x000ef;ve, aged mice may have been helped these mice resist CHIKV infection, but it may also have contributed to the poor immune responses to vaccination with CHIK VLPs. Reduction of vaccine efficacy due to inflammation has been observed in elderly people vaccinated with standard vaccines against influenza virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and hepatitis B [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated plasma levels of TNF-&#x003b1; correlate with lower antibody titers generated in post-menopausal women following vaccination with influenza vaccine. Thus, it is possible that the basal levels of TNF-&#x003b1; observed in age mice, but not in young mice, contributed to the decrease antibody responses observed after vaccination with CHIK VLP-based vaccines. A recent publication suggests that this problem may be circumvented by pre-treament of elderly patients with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Losmapimod, a small molecule p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, given that elderly people are already in a pro-inflammatory state, using an adjuvant to enhance inflammatory responses to a vaccine may not be the most beneficial approach for CHIKV.</p><p>In contrast to our observations in CHIKV-infected aged mice, a study by Uhrlaub <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] found that CHIKV infections resulted in more severe infections in aged mice. There are a few key differences between our studies. The ages of the adult and aged mice were similar, but we used female mice, while Uhrlaub <italic>et al</italic>. used male mice. They also used a different CHIKV strain: SL15649. This strain resulted in a different disease progression in adult male mice than what we observed in adult female mice: foot-swelling was biphasic with two peaks on days 3 and then on day 8 with SL15649 infection, while we observed one main peak on day 7 with LR2006-OPY1. While the progression of CHIKV-associated foot swelling we observed is comparable to what has been previously published by Gardner et al [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Metz et al [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] using CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 strain, biphasic foot-swelling has also been in observed with this same strain at 10<sup>6</sup> CCID<sub>50</sub> in female mice [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and at 10<sup>3</sup> focus-forming units in female and male mice [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, the use of different strains cannot be solely responsible for the difference in results. While not previously anticipated in our study, the stark difference in results may have to do with gender in aged mice. A longitudinal, retrospective study on prognostic factors of inhospital deaths in elderly patients by L. Godaert <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] found that the male sex was an independent predictor of inhospital deaths due to CHIKV infection. Thus, perhaps in aged mice, the male sex may also predispose them to more severe disease. In addition study by Uhrlaub <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that CD4+ T cells and neutralizing antibody responses elicited by CHIKV infections were significantly decreased in aged, male mice compared to the adult, male mice. Thus overall, even in the male mice, the VLP vaccine formulations would likely also elicit poor protective responses as compared to those in adult mice.</p><p>While our study suggests that na&#x000ef;ve, aged, female mice are resistant to CHIKV infections, infections in aged people are much more complicated. Comorbidities may increase the risk of developing more severe CHIKV disease upon infection. CHIKV infection may be complicated by pre-exisiting comorbidities or may exacerbate chronic renal, respiratory, cardiac diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A recent systematic meta-analysis of 11 different studies showed that hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, and asthma were the most frequent comorbidities associated with patients infected with CHIKV [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, hypertension and diabetes had a 4-5-fold higher prevalence in patients over 50 years of age, and patients with diabetes at higher risk for severe CHIKV disease [<xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, perhaps CHIKV infections in diabetic mouse or non-human primate models may provide a better understanding of CHIKV infection, spread, and virus-induced disease pathology observed in severe CHIKV-induced disease. In addition, it would be important to investigate these preconditions in both female and male animals. These models could then be used for preclinical testing of vaccines and antivirals against CHIKV.</p><p>In summary, CHIK VLPs alone elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers that protect 100% of mice from CHIKV infection and disease. However, more research is needed to identify a vaccine that will protect the elderly and people with chronic conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes against CHIKV disease. If the current measles-vectored an CHIK VLP-based vaccines make it through all phases of clinical trials, licensing of these vaccines should be limited to the aged groups in which they were tested in, until further research can be conducted. It is possible that a completely different set of vaccine formulations or regimens may need to be developed for the elderly.These would need to be thoroughly vetted in preclinical studies to ensure that older people are not put at further risk for severe CHIKV infections. Finally, relevant models of severe CHIKV disease in adults and aged animals are needed to evaluate these vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007316.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Initial Assessment of Chikungunya antigen-specific, IgG antibody responses in adult mice.</title><p>Vaccine responses in adult C57BL/6J mice were evaluated 8 weeks [three vaccine doses] post-initial vaccination with each VLP-based vaccine formulation delivered via IM injections, or PBS.
