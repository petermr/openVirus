 <p>Yellow fever (YF) is the most severe arbovirus to circulate in the Americas. French Guiana, a French overseas department located in South America between Brazil and Surinam, is the only European territory geographically located in the Amazonian forest complex and is considered endemic for YF. We conducted a large general population survey from June to October 2017 to estimate vaccination coverage in the population and to identify target vulnerable populations for catch-up vaccination strategies. In total, 1,415 households and 2,697 individuals were included from the 22 municipalities of French Guiana. YF vaccination coverage was estimated at 95.0% (95% CI: 93.4–96.2) in the entire territory but was spatially heterogeneous, with the lowest levels estimated in the western part of the territory along the Surinamese cross-border region, particularly in children under 16 years who were not enrolled in school, immigrant adults and disadvantaged groups of populations with low socioeconomic indexes. Our findings showed that vaccination campaigns should be prioritized and adapted to improve vaccination coverage among vulnerable populations living in the northwestern part of the territory to limit the risk of transmission in the context of the emerging YF threat in South America. Despite the relative rarity of YF and the significant number of infectious and tropical diseases in French Guiana, clinicians should adopt a high index of suspicion for YF, particularly in vulnerable and at-risk populations.</p>
