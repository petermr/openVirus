 <p>We would like to thank Dr. Peter Kilmarx, currently Deputy Director of the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Kathryn Curran of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for their support. We would also like to thank the many hard-working CDC employees, especially Dr. Kimberly Porter, who were part of the Ebola response team in January 2015 and helped us learn more about the outbreak response. We are grateful to Patrick Masuba for his expert professional interviewing and transcription skills. Finally, we thank our participants for graciously taking the time to talk with us during a national emergency.</p>
