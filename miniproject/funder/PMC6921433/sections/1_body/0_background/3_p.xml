<p id="Par10">High priority diseases for epidemic preparedness include Nipah virus, MERS-CoV, Lassa virus, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, Zika virus, and Rift Valley Fever [

Interestingly enough, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also acknowledged their predictions of diseases most likely to emerge as epidemics may not be accurate by including a “Disease X” in their priority list; Disease X “represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease” [
