 <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito borne pathogen that causes fever with rash and arthralgia, which are often confused with Dengue virus (DENV) infections. It has been reported that when CHIKV colonizes regions without previous circulation, it generally results in explosive human epidemics. In Panama, the first CHIKV infections were detected in May 2014. However, unlike many countries in the Americas, Panama presented with few autochthonous cases during the outbreak. In this study, we investigated the likely reason for the paucity of cases. Low vector infestation level, along with the surveillance programs, preparedness and early outbreak response possibly influenced the low number of cases observed during the Panamanian CHIKV outbreak.</p>
