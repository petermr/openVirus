<p>We constructed a modified SEIR model for smallpox transmission based on a model published in our previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Model parameters and their estimation have been previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We assumed that the virus has not been genetically modified and that there is minimal residual immunity in the population from previous vaccination, as described in our previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We assumed an initial attack size of 100, 1000 or 10,000 infected. Case isolation was assumed to reduce transmission to zero [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Given antivirals would be commenced after diagnosis and isolation, we assumed this effect would only apply in the healthcare setting and would not add to interruption of transmission above the effect of isolation alone, with the main transmission risk being in the community for undiagnosed or early cases prior to hospitalisation. We assumed that antivirals would therefore have no effect on community transmission, acknowledging that they would likely reduce morbidity and mortality for treated cases. We estimated number of hospital beds needed to control the epidemic, PPE requirements for clinical HCWs and public health workers required for contact tracing, under different scenarios.
