Despite official policies and guidelines recommending TB and HIV care integration, its poor implementation has resulted in TB and HIV remaining the commonest causes of death in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa.

Sixteen clinic supervisors who oversee 40 primary health care (PHC) clinics in two rural districts of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa will be randomized to either the control group (provision of standard government guidance for TB-HIV integration) or the intervention group (provision of standard government guidance with active enhancement of TB-HIV care integration through a quality improvement approach). The primary outcome is all-cause mortality among TB-HIV patients. Secondary outcomes include time to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation among TB-HIV co-infected patients, as well as TB and HIV treatment outcomes at 12&#x000a0;months. In addition, factors that may affect the intervention, such as conditions in the clinic and staff availability, will be closely monitored and documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study has the potential to address the gap between the establishment of TB-HIV care integration policies and guidelines and their implementation in the provision of integrated care in PHC clinics.

The vertical model of delivering TB-HIV care to co-infected patients relied upon referral and linkage to care programmes (between TB and HIV programmes and vice versa).

A group of South African researchers developed a model to illustrate the critical health system mechanisms that are essential to operationalize TB and HIV service integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Implementing integration requires <italic>Functional integration</italic> which is the extent to which integration is supported at the policy and budget level; <italic>Clinical integration</italic> which is the extent to which TB and HIV care, treatment, diagnostic testing, and health education activities are taking place concurrently; and <italic>Organizational integration</italic> which is the extent to which facility level resources (e.g., staff, infrastructure, space, patient files, and data systems) and processes (e.g., patient flow) are integrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

A total of 11.1 million people (19.9% of the South African population) live in KwaZulu-Natal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The province has the highest TB-HIV disease burden in South Africa with an estimated TB-HIV co-infection rate of 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The two districts were selected because they are rural with high burden of TB, HIV, and TB-HIV co-infection, despite TB and HIV treatment services in accordance with current guidelines being available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In 2016, 82.3% of TB-HIV co-infected patients were initiated on ART in KwaZulu-Natal, slightly lower than the national ART initiation rate of 84.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. King Cetshwayo district, located on the northern coast of KwaZulu-Natal, has a population of 937,793, with approximately 80% living in rural settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Similarly, Ugu district, situated in southern KwaZulu-Natal has 86% of its population of 750,214 living in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The in-hospital case fatality rate due to TB-HIV co-infection in both King Cetshwayo district (38.4%) and Ugu district (38.8%) remains high despite ART availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In 2015, over a quarter of all deaths in KwaZulu-Natal, irrespective of age or gender, were caused by TB (15.5%) or HIV (12.2%). PHC clinics offer community level frontline services and chronic care for all health ailments, including TB and HIV.

According to estimation from the clinic headcount data, an average of 4500 patients are seen in the two districts each month. In addition, the healthcare workers (HCWs) including PHC supervisors will be interviewed to collect clinic level information after obtaining informed consent for participation in interviews. These interviews will be collated and analyzed together with patient level data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization and study groups</title><p id="Par45">Randomization will occur at the level of the PHC supervisor. This is being done to avoid contamination of intervention effects into control clinics since each supervisor routinely supports multiple clinics. Each PHC clinic supervisor will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or control arm. The study investigators would provide a list of facilities and supervisors to be randomized using a computer-generated randomization list generated by study statistician. In South Africa, a PHC clinic supervisor fulfills a management role at PHC clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and are mandated to ensure smooth clinic operations through oversight of clinic performance against set targets including patient clinical outcomes and programme performance targets, and oversees the implementation of clinical guidelines. Each PHC clinic supervisor may oversee between three and five PHC clinics within one district. Therefore, through randomization of 14&#x02013;16 PHC clinic supervisors working in both the Ugu district and King Cetshwayo district, 40 clinics (20 in each arm) will be enrolled into this study as each supervisor oversees on average three to five medium-sized clinics. Not all clinics under the purview of the PHC clinic supervisors randomized will be enrolled into the study. Clinics will be excluded if ART services are not offered on site, services are run by a single nurse, and if they are mobile clinics or clinics located within hospitals.

This is done through iterative changes and peer-to-peer learning about successful changes and has been demonstrated to significantly improve HCW performance and lead to sustainable delivery of quality care with improved health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Breakthrough Series (BTS) is an example of quality improvement through learning collaborative, demonstrated to successfully impact health outcomes in developing-country settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The learning collaborative brings together clinic teams at regular intervals to learn QI methods and exchange challenges and successes in efforts to implement the TB-HIV care pathway (learning sessions). Each clinic will form a QI team that will work with the PHC supervisor and QI mentors between these learning sessions to develop local ideas for implementing a specific area of care, regularly measure performance using agreed-upon indicators, and bring back those results and emerging best practices to other clinic teams through periodic learning sessions. We aim to use this structured implementation approach to improve reliable delivery of published evidence-based interventions known to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with TB and HIV. The main measure of the collaborative&#x02019;s success will be measurable improvement in the magnitude, maintenance, and speed of specific steps of TB-HIV integration, ascertained through time-series analyses. These analyses will be collected and acted upon in real-time and will include process and outcome indicators. The magnitude of TB-HIV integration implementation will be measured by the extent to which interventions provide measurable improvements in PHC process indicators from baseline (e.g., coverage of HCT and IPT services among eligible patients, improvements in quality of services, proportion of HIV-infected patients offered IPT following a negative TB screening). We will also track the speed at which each of the eight TB-HIV integration interventions are implemented (e.g., the number of months taken to reach 90% implementation of individual integration interventions) and factors affecting speed of intervention uptake in the clinics.</p><p id="Par47">Systematic testing of change ideas will be evaluated through a rapid sequence of steps called the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. The PDSA cycle is a sequential framework for examining problems, deriving solutions, measuring progress, and embedding changes leading to positive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Selected HCWs from the study intervention clinics will be trained on QI methodology. This training will enable establishment of QI teams in intervention clinics to work test and implement change ideas to advance implementation of the TB-HIV integration interventions in rapid cycle (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and exchange successful ideas for change with other intervention sites through the learning collaborative. Furthermore, measures will be taken to prevent inadvertent cross-contamination of change ideas (e.g., by avoiding any convening of intervention and control clinics or personnel).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Training, coaching, and mentorship for HCWs implementing QI in clinics randomized to the intervention arm</title><p id="Par48">The QI approach promotes front-line staff engagement in the identification of problems affecting performance and catalyzing rapid cycle testing of possible solutions in each of the eight identified TB-HIV integration indicators (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The QI team at each of the intervention clinics will include the PHC supervisor from the District Health Management team, the QI clinic champion, the clinic&#x02019;s operation manager, selected clinic staff members, and a QI coach/mentor represented by a member of the study team.

Collaborative learning session one will coach teams in the use of a range of QI methods and tools (process mapping, fishbone system analysis, PDSA cycles, use of line graphs, and other data for improvement). Areas requiring improvement will be identified and prioritized, and aim statements encompassing specific aims and targets will be developed. Brainstorming by the QI team and process mapping will be done to define a strategy to effect positive change (&#x0201c;a change idea&#x0201d;). The PDSA cycles tracking a set of predefined indicators will be reviewed bi-weekly by the QI team to test if the recently adopted change idea resulted in performance improvement, throughout the study period. This will enable the generation of new ideas for improvement, iterative testing of these ideas, and monitoring of progress attained through use of run charts and graphs. Learning session two, scheduled 6&#x000a0;months later will review learnings for all successful change ideas and challenges against overall clinic performance, with the goal of scaling back on frequency of QI support meetings for clinics that are undertaking reliable improvement work. Learning session three, scheduled at month 12, will be focused on review and scalability of the final successful change package. It is anticipated that after learning session three, the clinic&#x02019;s QI teams would sustain successful change ideas. Lessons learned will also be shared and documented across the intervention teams. At the successful conclusion of the projects, the intention is to scale up a reliable &#x0201c;change package&#x0201d; of successful, tested changes across all clinics in the two districts, if not across the entire district.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Standard of care in the control clinics: description of TB, HIV, and integration services</title><p id="Par51">Since the 2009 endorsement of integrated TB-HIV services by the South African National AIDS Council (SANAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and adoption of TB-HIV service integration into policy and practice by the National Department of Health (NDoH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], South African guidelines recommend integration of TB and HIV services by a single service provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par52">Data on TB-HIV integration indicators will be obtained from patient files and existing standard customized electronic data management systems supported by SA DoH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

If successful, the strategy could make a contribution to reducing TB-HIV-associated mortality and morbidity in South Africa and other regions of the world where co-infection with TB and HIV is a concern. In 2013, WHO performed a joint review of HIV, TB, and prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programmes in South Africa, which recommended the need for context-specific mechanisms for the delivery of integrated TB-HIV services at PHC and community level, with particular focus on improving access to TB and HIV services for children, adolescents, and key populations. Some studies undertaken in the South African PHC clinic setting have shown that the QI strategy can be effective as an intervention for PMTCT care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. To date, there have been no studies that have explored the use of the QI model as an intervention to improve integration of TB and HIV treatment. An important component of the QI model is the PDSA cycle, comprising learning cycles to test and revise theory-based predictions as recommended by Taylor et al. (2014) in their systematic review on the application of the PDSA method to improve quality in healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. We anticipate that the findings from this trial will offer an affordable and sustainable strategy through use of the QI model to effectively improve the integration of TB-HIV programmes. The study results will be communicated to stakeholders through dissemination meetings, conferences, and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Recommendations would be made based on the study findings for appropriate actions to be considered and taken by the department of health and relevant authorities in areas with high burden of TB and HIV.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par58">Data collection is currently on-going.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p id="Par5">Antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BREC</term><def><p id="Par6">Biomedical research ethics committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAPRISA</term><def><p id="Par7">Centre for the AIDS programme of research in South Africa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COACH</term><def><p id="Par8">Context assessment for community health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPT</term><def><p id="Par9">Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHIS</term><def><p id="Par10">District Health Information System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DoH</term><def><p id="Par11">Department of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GEE</term><def><p id="Par12">Generalized estimation equations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBC</term><def><p id="Par13">High burden countries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCT</term><def><p id="Par14">HIV counseling and testing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCWs</term><def><p id="Par15">Healthcare workers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par16">Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPT</term><def><p id="Par17">Isoniazid preventive therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDSA</term><def><p id="Par18">Plan-Do-Study-Act</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHC</term><def><p id="Par19">Primary health care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PMTCT</term><def><p id="Par20">Prevention of mother to child transmission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QI</term><def><p id="Par21">Quality improvement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SA</term><def><p id="Par22">South Africa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUTHI</term><def><p id="Par23">Addressing challenges in scaling up TB and HIV treatment integration in public health settings in South Africa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TB</term><def><p id="Par24">Tuberculosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TIER.Net</term><def><p id="Par25">Three interlinked electronic register for tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par26">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to acknowledge BroadReach for their supportive role at the study clinics as specified in the current health systems strengthening (HSS) grant awarded to them by USAID (Cooperative Agreement No. AID-674-A-12-00016).
