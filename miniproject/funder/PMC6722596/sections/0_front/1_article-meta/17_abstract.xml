 <p>Filovirus serological diagnosis and epidemiological investigations are hampered due to the unavailability of validated immunoassays. Diagnostic performance of three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (I-ELISA) was evaluated for the detection of IgG antibody to Ebola virus (EBOV) in human sera. One I-ELISA was based on a whole EBOV antigen (WAg) and two utilized recombinant nucleocapsid (NP) and glycoproteins (GP), respectively. Validation data sets derived from individual sera collected in South Africa (SA), representing an EBOV non-endemic country, and from sera collected during an Ebola disease (EBOD) outbreak in Sierra Leone (SL), were categorized according to the compounded results of the three I-ELISAs and real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the cut-off values selected at 95% accuracy level by the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis, specificity in the SA EBOV negative serum panel (
  <italic>n</italic> = 273) ranged from 98.17% (GP ELISA) to 99.27% (WAg ELISA). Diagnostic specificity in the SL EBOV negative panel (
  <italic>n</italic> = 676) was 100% by the three ELISAs. The diagnostic sensitivity in 423 RT-PCR confirmed EBOD patients was dependent on the time when the serum was collected after onset of disease. It significantly increased 2 weeks post-onset, reaching 100% sensitivity by WAg and NP and 98.1% by GP I-ELISA.
