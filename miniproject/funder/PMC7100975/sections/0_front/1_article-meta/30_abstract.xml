 <p>Chikungunya is a tropical, mosquito-borne virus that has been re-emerging in the last decade. It has caused major epidemics in recent years, including in Reunion Island and in Southeast Asia. Nearly 2.5 billion people around the world are at risk of contracting the virus. In the acute phase of the illness, patients experience a flu-like syndrome with fever, headache, myalgia, rash, and severe arthralgia. These symptoms can persist for several months in some patients, and can lead to significant functional disability. During the 2013 epidemic in Martinique, we followed nearly 200 patients who had contracted chikungunya. More than half of the patients had a chronic form of the disease—mainly women over 50 years of age. Our statistical analyses indicate that poor hydration in the acute phase is a risk factor for developing chronic rheumatism. This suggests that, in the context of a chikungunya epidemic, patients should drink plenty of fluids as soon as the first symptoms appear.</p>
