 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is classified into two lineages, African and Asian/American. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that Asian/American-lineage ZIKV strains can be divided into three distinct subtypes, the American, Pacific, and Southeast Asian subtypes, presenting several amino acid differences. In this study, we examined the in vitro and in vivo growth of three Asian/American lineage ZIKV strains belonging to the three subtypes. The American-subtype strain and the Southeast Asian-subtype strain exhibited the highest and lowest growth potential in vitro, respectively, and mice infected with these ZIKV strains also showed the highest and lowest viremia levels and infectious virus levels in the testis. Moreover, the rate and extent of testis damage were highest in mice infected with the American-subtype strain. Our results indicate that the American-subtype and Pacific-subtype strains exhibit increased ability to grow in vitro and in vivo and to induce testis damage in mice.</p>
