Timely and accurate estimates of influenza prevalence, particularly of severe cases requiring hospitalization, can improve control measures to reduce transmission and mortality. Here, we extend a previously published machine learning method for influenza forecasting to integrate multiple diverse data sources, including traditional surveillance data, electronic health records, internet search traffic, and social media activity. Our hierarchical framework uses multi-linear regression to combine forecasts from multiple data sources and greedy optimization with forward selection to sequentially choose the most predictive combinations of data sources. We show that the systematic integration of complementary data sources can substantially improve forecast accuracy over single data sources. When forecasting the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza-like-illness reports (ILINet) from week 48 through week 20, the optimal combination of predictors includes public health surveillance data and commercially available electronic medical records, but neither search engine nor social media data.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>In the United States, seasonal influenza causes thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations. The annual timing and burden of the flu season vary considerably with the severity of the circulating viruses. Epidemic forecasting can inform early and effective countermeasures to limit the human toll of severe seasonal and pandemic influenza. With a growing toolkit of sophisticated statistical methods and the recent explosion of influenza-related data, we can now systematically match models to data to achieve timely and accurate warning as flu epidemics emerge, peak and subside. Here, we introduce a framework for identifying optimal combinations of data sources, and show that public health surveillance data and electronic health records collectively forecast seasonal influenza better than any single data source alone and better than influenza-related search engine and social media data.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>GM087719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyers</surname><given-names>Lauren Ancel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Defense Threat Reduction Agency (US)</institution></funding-source><award-id>HDTRA1-14-C-0114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyers</surname><given-names>Lauren Ancel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>We would like to acknowledge funding from Defense Threat Reduction Agency (US) HDTRA1-14-C-0114 and NIH/NIGMS MIDAS grant U01 GM087719.

Early detection and forecasting of both emergence and peak epidemic activity can inform an effective allocation of resources, surge planning, and public health messaging [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, public health and scientific communities have prioritized the development of influenza forecasting technologies [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>There are a growing number and variety of readily available disease-related data sources that may ultimately be integrated into or even replace traditional systems. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relies on data from two primary national influenza surveillance systems: (1) the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories (henceforth, WHO US) and (2) the US Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). Recently, Meaningful Use [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], a CDC led effort, is advancing the expansion of syndromic surveillance systems such as ESSENCE to address a broader set of infectious disease surveillance objectives [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Novel data sources for outbreak surveillance are also arising outside of public health. Notably, researchers at Google launched the Google Flu Trends service (GFT) in 2008 to provide real-time estimates of influenza prevalence based on disease-related search activity [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They showed that time series tracking the volumes of influenza-related Google searches closely mirrored influenza data from ILINet. However, it failed to capture the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and fell short in subsequent influenza seasons [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], resulting in the termination of the program in August 2015 by the company. Epidemic-related data have also been extracted from not only search engines [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but also interactive web-based applications (e.g., Flu Near You, InfluenzaNet) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and online social platforms such as Twitter (e.g., MappyHealth) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Facebook [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Wikipedia [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While most of these data sources contain broad information, epidemic related data is <italic>passively</italic> mined and filtered. There are, however, a few participatory systems that <italic>directly</italic> solicit health data from voluntary participants [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, InfluenzaNet, has over 50 000 volunteers from ten European countries [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While many of these sources have been shown, individually, to estimate and predict influenza activity, we have yet to build forecasting models based on systematic comparisons and integration of complementary data.</p><p>Given the real-time availability of GFT at multiple geographic scales (from city to continental), many of the early forecasting methods used GFT as a test bed. Notably, Shaman et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] pioneers the use of Kalman filters to predict seasonal GFT dynamics from historical GFT and humidity data and Nsoesie et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] couples a simulation optimization method with a network-based epidemiological model to forecast regional influenza peaks. Another study forecasts GFT from a combination of GFT, temperature, and humidity data in a specific metropolitan area (Baltimore), and demonstrates that the integration of multiple data sources can improve forecast accuracy [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>More recent forecasting efforts have directly targeted CDC ILINet, rather than GFT, using a variety of predictor data sources. Brooks et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] apply a novel simulation-based Bayesian forecasting framework to forecast one season of ILINet from prior ILINet data. Their method first constructs prior distributions of seasonal flu curves by stochastically combining and transforming features of past flu seasons. As a season emerges, it updates the posterior distribution based on real-time observations and uses importance sampling to generate forecasts. Two other studies forecast ILINet from alternative data sources&#x02014;one evaluates the predictive performance of Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia, individually [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and the other considers a multi-linear combination of internet source, digital surveillance, and electronic medical records data [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Such data sources vary considerably in both availability and reliability. Some are available in near-real time, whereas others are lagged by days or weeks; some deeply sample geographic or socioeconomic slices of a population, whereas others provide representative but sparse samples of an entire population. In particular, internet and social media data can be misleading, particularly during newsworthy epidemiological events [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but potentially provide a valuable real-time window into emerging events when combined with validated public health or medical data sources. Optimization allows us to systematically balance such trade-offs and quantify the informational content and complementarity of different categories of data. We argue that, for a given forecasting task, candidate data sources should be evaluated and integrated based on clear performance metrics, which may include, for example, measures of forecast accuracy or precision at one or across multiple time points.</p><p>Here, we introduce an optimization method for designing robust multi-source epidemic forecasting systems and apply it forecasting seasonal flu in the US. Our framework is intended to be <italic>plug-and-play</italic>, allowing researchers to evaluate large combinations of data sources with respect to their own forecasting model and performance metrics. In our case study, the candidate data sources include thousands of time series data sources from public health surveillance systems, electronic health records systems (EHR), search engines, and other website and social media applications. Our forecasting model is an extension of the flexible Bayesian machine learning method introduced in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], modified to combine multiple predictors. Finally, our objective function considers overall similarity between historical data and out-of-sample forecasts, averaging across 16 recent flu seasons. Unlike recent multi-source forecasting studies (such as [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), we present a framework to rigorously evaluate much larger sets of candidate data sources both at the national and regional level and select complementary combinations that maximize forecast performance metrics. This approach not only yields more accurate forecasts, but provides quantitative insight into the relative utility of data sources.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Data sources</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Forecasting target data</title><p>Our forecasting target is the aggregate flu data from ILINet, the CDC national sentinel surveillance system [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

The forecasts decline only slightly relative to systems that include ILINet. However, when both ILINet and WHO data are excluded, the expected performance drops considerably.

However, the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 forecasts capture the peaks but considerably overestimate prevalence towards the ends of the seasons (12 weeks out of 24 lie outside the 95% credible interval). Excluding these two seasons, 92.9% of all historical weeks fall within the forecasted 95% interval.

To achieve earlier and more accurate predictions of epidemic emergence, growth, peaks and burden, researchers are developing sophisticated statistical methods&#x02013;some adapted from mature forecasting sciences like meteorology [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]&#x02013;and creatively leveraging diverse sources of predictor data. The increasing public availability of disease-related data sources is promising yet daunting, with annually, hundreds of thousands of influenza-related tweets [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], several millions of page hits on Wikipedia to influenza-related pages [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], thousands of influenza-related blog posts on Wordpress [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and hundreds of thousands of hospital and clinic visits. While many studies have demonstrated the promise of surveillance [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and forecasting from novel data sources [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we do not yet have rigorous methods for evaluating the utility of such data or identifying effective combinations of data for particular models and forecasting goals.</p><p>Over several years, we have developed a general framework for addressing exactly this challenge [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For any public health surveillance goal, the approach is designed to systematically evaluate up to thousands of candidate data sources and identify complementary combinations of predictors that achieve the stated goal. For example, we have identified optimal zip codes for seasonal flu surveillance and early detection of pandemic flu in Texas [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], selected informative clinics for dengue surveillance in Puerto Rico [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and developed software for optimal selection and integration of surveillance data sources for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency&#x02019;s (DTRA&#x02019;s) Biosurveillance Ecosystem (BSVE) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have used this framework to design multi-source surveillance systems for accurate forecasting of seasonal influenza, and, in the process, rigorously assess the performance and complementarity of diverse data sources. To do so, we combined two previously published methods. The first is an empirical Bayes strategy for forecasting seasonal flu from a single data source [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Rather than imposing strong assumptions about transmission dynamics, it assumes that the forecasting target (typically, the currently emerging flu season) will roughly resemble past seasons in terms of the shape, peak week, peak magnitude, and pace of the epidemic curve. By combining and perturbing these features from prior seasonal data, we simulate distributions of plausible (hybrid) flu curves. Then, as a season unfolds, we predict future weeks by extrapolating from variates that most resemble recent activity. To forecast flu (target) from <italic>multiple</italic> data sources (predictors), we make empirical Bayes forecasts of each predictor separately and combine them into a target forecast using a linear model previously fit to historical predictor and target data. The second method is a greedy optimization that sequentially selects a maximally informative set of data sources to achieve a specified goal [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In our case, the candidate providers are a diverse set of public health, commercial health-care, internet query and social media data sources. Our public health goal is accurate forecasting of seasonal flu starting in calendar week 48.</p><p>The field has primarily focused on the development of statistical models that predict seasonal dynamics on multiple geopolitical scales, and only secondarily considered the quality of predictor data. Test bed data are often selected based on convenience. Until recently, Google Flu Trends data was free and abundant at multiple scales, and thus a popular choice [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A few studies have integrated multiple different types of data and shown that, for short-term forecasting (one to three weeks ahead), the combination of all independent flu predictors performs better than using single source [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, they have not systematically optimized the combination of data sources or quantified their relative contributions to forecast accuracy, as we have done here. Our study confirms that multi-source forecasting can outperform single-source forecasting, but only when complementary sources are identified and systematically integrated.</p><p>We optimized forecasting models from three classes of data&#x02013;traditional public health surveillance data, electronic health records (EHR) from a data services company, and data aggregated from the influenza-related internet search and social network activity. A priori, each has pros and cons. Official surveillance systems are designed for the purpose of monitoring and predicting flu activity, and thus may provide more accurate and robust signals than the alternatives. However, surveillance data tends to be sparse and time-lagged. Internet source data can be abundant and immediately available, but provides only correlated activity that can be highly susceptible to extrinsic perturbations such as media events and modifications to source websites [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. EHR data has the combined advantages of real-time availability and access to multi-dimensional flu data at various geographic scales. However, it is not freely available and may require statistical corrections for sampling biases.</p><p>Our analyses provide quantitative insights into harnessing these trade-offs for forecasting. First, when data sources are evaluated individually, we find that public health surveillance data yields the most accurate forecasts, followed by EHR data, and internet-source data trailing far behind. Second, optimized combinations of data sources (with or without ILINet) provide far better forecasts than any individual data source alone. Third, EHR data are always selected before internet-source data to augment public health data, suggesting that EHR&#x02019;s provide a more valuable source of complementary information. Forth, when CDC and WHO data are excluded, the optimal EHR and internet-source systems are unable to achieve comparable forecasting performance. Fifth, state-level EHR data improves forecasts significantly more than national-level EHR data.</p><p>While we believe that these insights are robust, they may reflect specific assumptions of our model, and not apply to other diseases, forecasting methods, or objective functions. First, the superior performance of the public health data source is likely biased by our choice of ILINet as the <italic>gold standard</italic> forecasting target. If we had instead sought to forecast athenahealth or GFT time series, these data sources may have been selected as their own top predictors. However, we believe that this choice of target is justified, as it is the only data source specifically designed to estimate flu prevalence in the US. Along with WHO it always selected as a top predictor for selected level forecasts. Second, we follow Brooks et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in assuming uniform distributions for peak height and peak week, constrained by historical observations. This might limit forecasting accuracy for seasons with atypically high, low, early or late peaks. To address this, one could assume distributions that include low probability extreme departures from past seasons.</p><p>We emphasize that this framework is designed to select optimal combinations of data sources for any combination of predictor data sources, multi-linear forecasting method and objective function. As a case study, we built optimal combinations of data sources for forecasting seasonal flu using a published univariate Bayesian empirical framework ([<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) that we extended to forecast with multiple data sources. The optimized systems provide reliable forecasts of the overall seasonal trends and epidemic peak, in most of the 16 historical out-of-sample evaluations. The data-driven selection of informative predictors revealed that public health surveillance data is invaluable for flu forecasting, and that, when rigorously integrated into forecasting models, proprietary electronic health record data can significantly increase accuracy, to a greater degree than freely available internet data. The same optimization framework, forecasting method and RMSE objective function could be readily applied to designing high performing multi-linear forecasting systems for other diseases, for which we have amble historic data, such as Dengue [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and Chikungunya [<xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. By modifying the objective function, we can alternatively build systems for forecasting early transmission dynamics or clinical severity of emerging outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006236.s001"><label>S1 Algorithm</label><caption><title>Hierarchical data source selection.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006236.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006236.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Data selected for forecasting ILINet in three US states.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006236.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006236.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Historical flu forecasts from 1997-1998 through 2013-2014 (excluding 2009-2010) from two of the optimized five-source systems.</title><p>The &#x02018;All&#x02019; system was optimized from all candidate data sources; the &#x02018;All national without ILINet&#x02019; system was optimized from all national-scale data sources except ILINet.
