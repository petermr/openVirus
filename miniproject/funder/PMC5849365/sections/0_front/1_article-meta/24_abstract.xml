 <p>Dengue virus (DENV) was first identified in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in 1944. Dengue is currently assumed to be an endemic disease in PNG although there is little incidence or prevalence data, and the evidence consensus for dengue presence is low. Routine surveillance is not undertaken and dengue is not a notifiable disease. Severe dengue is rarely identified by local clinicians and the reasons for this are unclear but may be related to poor recognition of dengue and a low index of suspicion, despite high incidence and prevalence rates in neighbouring countries. For example, Indonesia shares borders with PNG and regularly reports outbreaks of severe dengue and transmission of multiple DENV serotypes. DENV infection is identified in travellers from PNG however there are no data on locally circulating strains and how they may compare to viruses associated with severe dengue epidemics in other countries in the Asia Pacific region. We identified evidence for previous infection with all four DENV serotypes among people living on the northern coast of PNG, in Madang, and on Lihir Island in the Bismarck Archipelago off the northeastern coast. We also detected DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 virus in febrile patients, and we describe the first whole genome sequences of endemically circulating DENV since the prototype 1944 DENV-2
  <sub>New Guinea C</sub> strain was characterized. Of note, severe dengue was not diagnosed in any patient infected with these viruses in PNG although introduction of the PNG DENV-3 strain into the Solomon Islands five years later resulted in a large outbreak of severe dengue with hospitalizations and deaths in that country. Dengue epidemiology and burden of disease should be investigated in PNG.
