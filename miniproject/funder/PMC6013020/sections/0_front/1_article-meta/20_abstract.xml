 <p>Assessing the ability of common mosquito species to transmit Zika virus (ZIKV) and characterizing variation in mosquito transmission of different ZIKV strains is important for estimating regional outbreak potential and for prioritizing local mosquito control strategies for 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
  <italic>Culex</italic> species. In this study, we evaluated the laboratory vector competence of 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, 
  <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, and 
  <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> that originated in areas of California where ZIKV cases in travelers since 2015 were frequent. We observed variation in infection loads between ZIKV strains in 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic>, but transmission rates were not different. In addition, there was a positive relationship between ZIKV RNA levels in infected mosquitoes ascertained from bodies and ZIKV RNA transmission rates. Our data add to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> as a ZIKV vector and refute 
  <italic>Cx</italic>. 
  <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
  <italic>Cx</italic>. 
  <italic>tarsalis</italic> as vectors.
