A large amount of HFRS cases occur in China, especially in the Heilongjiang Province, raising great concerns regarding public health. The distribution of these cases across space-time often exhibits highly heterogeneous characteristics. Hence, it is widely recognized that the improved mapping of heterogeneous HFRS distributions and the quantitative assessment of the space-time disease transition patterns can advance considerably the detection, prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A synthesis of space-time mapping and probabilistic logic is proposed to study the distribution of monthly HFRS population-standardized incidences in Heilongjiang province during the period 2005&#x02013;2013. We introduce a class-dependent Bayesian maximum entropy (cd-BME) mapping method dividing the original dataset into discrete incidence classes that overcome data heterogeneity and skewness effects and can produce space-time HFRS incidence estimates together with their estimation accuracy. A ten-fold cross validation analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed cd-BME implementation compared to the standard class-independent BME implementation. Incidence maps generated by cd-BME are used to study the spatiotemporal HFRS spread patterns. Further, the spatiotemporal dependence of HFRS incidences are measured in terms of probability logic indicators that link class-dependent HFRS incidences at different space-time points. These indicators convey useful complementary information regarding intraclass and interclass relationships, such as the change in HFRS transition probabilities between different incidence classes with increasing geographical distance and time separation.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Each HFRS class exhibited a distinct space-time variation structure in terms of its varying covariance parameters (shape, sill and correlation ranges). Given the heterogeneous features of the HFRS dataset, the cd-BME implementation demonstrated an improved ability to capture these features compared to the standard implementation (e.g., mean absolute error: 0.19 <italic>vs</italic>. 0.43 cases/10<sup>5</sup> capita) demonstrating a point outbreak character at high incidence levels and a non-point spread character at low levels. Intraclass HFRS variations were found to be considerably different than interclass HFRS variations. Certain incidence classes occurred frequently near one class but were rarely found adjacent to other classes. Different classes may share common boundaries or they may be surrounded completely by another class. The HFRS class 0&#x02013;68.5% was the most dominant in the Heilongjiang province (covering more than 2/3 of the total area). The probabilities that certain incidence classes occur next to other classes were used to estimate the transitions between HFRS classes. Moreover, such probabilities described the dependency pattern of the space-time arrangement of HFRS patches occupied by the incidence classes. The HFRS transition probabilities also suggested the presence of both positive and negative relations among the main classes. The HFRS indicator plots offer complementary visualizations of the varying probabilities of transition between incidence classes, and so they describe the dependency pattern of the space-time arrangement of the HFRS patches occupied by the different classes.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The cd-BME method combined with probabilistic logic indicators offer an accurate and informative quantitative representation of the heterogeneous HFRS incidences in the space-time domain, and the results thus obtained can be interpreted readily. The same methodological combination could also be used in the spatiotemporal modeling and prediction of other epidemics under similar circumstances.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Heilongjiang Province reported the largest number of HFRS cases in China. Previous studies focused on identifying the severe HFRS outbreak regions, exploring the relative impact of environmental factors, forecasting HFRS cases etc. However, the study of the spatiotemporal spread dynamics and patterns of HFRS is still lacking, which is the focus of the present study. This study proposed a novel mapping technique (i.e., class-dependent Bayesian Maximum Entropy, cd-BME) for studying the distribution of HFRS, overcoming the highly heterogeneous features of HFRS data; and, probabilistic logic notions (stochastic indicators) were employed to study the spatiotemporal dependency of HFRS incidence and draw conclusions regarding the HFRS spread under conditions of uncertainty. By dividing the original HFRS data into four classes in terms of percentiles, the cd-BME exhibited better performance in mapping HFRS distribution than the standard (class-independent) BME technique and the mainstream inverse distance technique. Regarding the maps of HFRS distribution, the point outbreak character dominated the HFRS spread at high incidence levels, whereas the lowest incidence level covered more than 2/3 of Heilongjiang Province. Certain HFRS incidence generally occurred between intraclass or neighbor classes. The probabilities of HFRS transition between incidence classes with various spatial distances and temporal instants can be found in the HFRS indicator plots. The above comprehensive information can allow a better understanding of the spatiotemporal HFRS spread mechanisms and further improve HFRS decision-making, management and control.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41671399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1865-5764</contrib-id><name><surname>Christakos</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11501339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wenyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201706320278</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1873-3125</contrib-id><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Junyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41671399 and 11501339), the China Scholarship Council (201706320278) and the National Mega-Project for the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases (No. 2018ZX10713003).

During the past seven decades, this rodent-borne zoonosis, caused by Hantavirus, has been spreading southwards to other parts of China. Currently, 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and metropolitan areas of mainland China, are exposed to significant health risks due to this infectious disease. In particular, the reported HFRS cases correspond to approximately 90% of all global number of cases [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Specifically, the <italic>Hantaan</italic> virus (HTNV) and the <italic>Seoul</italic> virus (SEOV), hosted by <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic> and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, respectively, are the two predominant sources of HFRS in China (see, e.g., [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). The hantavirus is transmitted from rodents to humans through inhalation of aerosolized excreta (such as urine and saliva) or direct contact [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Infected human specimens suffer from fever, headache, abdominal pain, insufficient renal function, and hemorrhagic episodes [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For the period 2004&#x02013;2008, most HFRS cases reported in China concerned young and middle-age farmers [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with case fatality rate (CFR) 1.17%, and females experiencing higher CFRs than males in the age groups of 20&#x02013;39 and &#x0003e;50 years [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also HFRS cases in males were more than three times higher than those reported in females. Evidently, HFRS poses a serious threat to public health in China.</p><p>Previous HFRS studies have focused on different aspects of the epidemic, such as the following cases:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Identification of regions with severe HFRS outbreaks. Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], e.g., used spatial autocorrelation, local indicators of spatial association, and Kulldorff&#x02019;s space-time scan statistic, to identify distinct cluster areas of outbreak episodes in northeastern, central and eastern China. Similarly, Wu et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] applied cluster analysis, temporal cluster analysis, and space-time cluster analysis, to identify various epidemic clusters in Liaoning Province of China (including a primary cluster in the western part of the province and two secondary clusters in its eastern part).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quantitative analysis of the impact of physiographic characteristics and environmental variables on HFRS population-standardized incidences. Yan et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], e.g., employed a multivariate logistic regression model to study the relationship between HFRS incidence and various landscape and environmental elements. The study concluded that elevation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, annual cumulative air temperature, semihydromorhic soils, timber forests and orchards, were closely related to HFRS incidence. In a more recent study, Li et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] applied a geographically weighted regression model to Chinese data during the period 2005&#x02013;2009, and concluded that temperature, precipitation, humidity, NDVI, land use and elevation significantly impacted the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of HFRS incidences. Also, Tian et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and He et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used wavelet analysis to study how the dynamics of HFRS are linked to rainfall, temperature, rodents&#x02019; density and the multivariate El Ni&#x000f1;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index.</p></list-item><list-item><p>HFRS incidence forecasting. Liu et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Li et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] successfully applied autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA models to produce forecasts of HFRS in China and Heilongjiang Province, respectively. Moreover, seasonal ARIMA models with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) were also developed for forecasting HFRS in four counties with severe HFRS outbreaks [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clinical manifestation case studies. For example, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared various clinical indices involving 152 patients in Heilongjiang Province, and showed that SEOV infections are milder and less typical than those caused by HTNV.</p></list-item></list><p>While, as described above, a significant level of understanding has been reached regarding the specific characteristics of HFRS and its linkage to physiographic variables, its dynamics and associated spatiotemporal spread patterns remain mostly unexplored. The present work aims at bridging this gap, by using the spatiotemporal Bayesian Maximum Entropy theory (BME) to develop a fully probabilistic approach that allows a rigorous quantitative representation of HFRS population-standardized incidences in the space-time domain (BME belongs to the field of modern spatiotemporal geostatistics, [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). At this point we notice that BME has been successfully applied in the study of several infectious diseases, such as syphilis, hand food and mouth disease, influenza, dengue fever, and Black death [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our study area is the Heilongjiang Province, which experiences the highest HFRS population-standardized incidences in China [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], caused by both HTNV and SEOV [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the Heilongjiang case study, the main advantage of the proposed BME-based approach is that it can account for certain crucial aspects of space-time HFRS spread, as follows:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i)</label><p>Spatiotemporal evolution: The proposed approach not only accounts for the fact that, as is the case with all infectious diseases, the spatiotemporal HFRS evolution can be influenced by several environmental factors, but also for the fact that, as a natural phenomenon, the HFRS spread follows a propagation law with the number of human infections being closely related to human-rodents interactions. In this twofold phenomenological context, when a core area is formed during the disease outbreak, and as time advances, the disease spreads radially from the core center in all directions. The accurate characterization of the spatiotemporal HFRS spread pattern is of essence, and the thus acquired knowledge can be integrated with other information sources (about the disease and its environment) to improve public health management through prevention and control.</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii)</label><p>Incidence heterogeneity: A crucial observation to be accounted by the proposed approach is that the HFRS infection level varies in a heterogeneous manner across space-time, which means that the adequate distinction between incidence classes can play a significant role in the accurate mapping and risk assessment of regional disease spread during the time period of interest. Furthermore, since infectious disease outbreaks can occur in very short time periods and infect a large number of individuals, and given the highly variable character of disease attributes, it is difficult (both theoretically and practically) and often unrealistic to model simultaneously both the extreme values and the regular values of population-standardized incidences. In other words, a model that considers the distribution of all incidence levels as a single (super) class can neither adequately represent nor fully explain the spread pattern of a specific incidence class, because of smoothing effects and the existence of extreme (high/low) incidence levels in the same setting.</p></list-item><list-item><label>iii)</label><p>Class transmission and propagation: The probabilistic assessment of the HFRS transmission and propagation patterns among various incidence classes is currently lacking (e.g., the probability of HFRS transmitting from one incidence class to another class at various spatial distances and time separations apart). Yet such an assessment could provide valuable scientific support for HFRS monitoring and control purposes. Accordingly, the adequate representation of the spatiotemporal distributions and operations (transmissions, propagations) between of distinct incidence classes is an important task of any quantitative HFRS study.</p></list-item></list><p>In view of the above considerations <italic>i</italic>-<italic>iii</italic>, the three main objectives of the present work are as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To overcome data-related methodological and practical difficulties (such as highly heterogeneous data distributions across space-time) by using a cd-BME method that divides the infectious disease dataset into discrete classes (the incidence classes were selected based on variability reduction and mapping coverage criteria).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To generate HFRS distribution maps that account for the real fact that the intraclass and interclass incidence data is subject to uncertainty, and to show that the cd-BME method can produce more accurate incidence estimates at locations and times where no HFRS records are available than standard (class-independent) mapping techniques.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To introduce practical and easily interpretable indicators of spatiotemporal dependency based on probability logic [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

In the context of the categorical HFRS representation used in this work, two kinds of HFRS spread patterns were assumed for comparison purposes: outward HFRS spread that links a specific incidence class to the entire set of incidence classes, and inward HFRS spread that is concerned with incidence transition from the entire set of classes to a specific class.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Space-time mapping of HFRS incidences using class-based BME</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Spatiotemporal correlation (covariance model) of HFRS incidences</title><p>Monthly spatial correlations of the original HFRS incidence <italic>X</italic>(<bold><italic>p</italic></bold>) were first calculated (108 covariances, in total). The temporal variation of the HSRF mean is smooth and periodic, fluctuating constantly around the 0.25 incidence value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). The covariance sill values explain the variance of HFRS incidence in the Heilongjiang Province during the same month, exhibiting certain noticeable peaks at twelve months period, the size of which reduce with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g003">Fig 3b</xref>). The interpretation of these high peaks is that they imply the presence of high uncertainty (or the presence of outbreaks at specific locations) in the HFRS variation during the peak times. The correlation ranges determine the HFRS domain of influence, showing a rough variation with time, which, like the HFRS mean variation, it also exhibits a periodic character (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g003">Fig 3c</xref>). The minimum and maximum values of the correlation range during the period 2005&#x02013;2013 are 21,700 meters and 897,650 meters, respectively. The functional shapes of the HFRS mean, covariance sill and range are remarkably similar (e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g004">Fig 4</xref> large (small) HSRF mean values are directly linked to long (short) correlation ranges).

These incidence patches are mutually exclusive, bounded and they have varying sizes. Certain HFRS patches seem to be distinctly elongated toward some preferred direction, indicating the presence of anisotropy. Sometimes the HFRS patches are clearly separated from one another, some other times they share common boundaries, and yet some other times they are completely surrounded by another class (e.g., in various monthly maps the classes <italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>4</sub> occur as patches within the class <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub>). The proportions of regional cover by each incidence class shows the dominance of class <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub> within which all the other classes are embedded, so that class <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub> acts like a background class.</p><fig id="pntd.0007091.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0007091.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>HFRS incidence maps of Heilongjiang province during 2008 in terms of the incidence classes considered.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0007091.g006"/></fig><p>In this work we also calculated the mean distances across patches during each month of the period 2005&#x02013;2013 using the centers of each incidence patch.

These mean distances across patches may be interpreted as effective ranges beyond which the transition probabilities remain essentially constant. As we observe in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007091.s021">S11 Fig</xref>, the temporal variations of the mean distances across patches are stationary, i.e., they fluctuate around certain constant values, as follow: 272 <italic>Km</italic> (mean distance across <italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub> patches), 304 <italic>Km</italic> (across <italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub> &#x02212; <italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> patches), 340 <italic>Km</italic> (across <italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub> &#x02212; <italic>I</italic><sub>4</sub> patches), 255 <italic>Km</italic> (across <italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> patches), 273 <italic>Km</italic> (across <italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> &#x02212; <italic>I</italic><sub>4</sub> patches), and 273 <italic>Km</italic> (across <italic>I</italic><sub>4</sub> patches).

The reciprocals of the mean distances between incidence patches can also serve as the intensity parameters of the four classes.

In this modeling context, key attributes of the HFRS incidence distribution were quantified by means of covariance functions, shedding light on the predominant HFRS spread patterns in space and time. A methodological advancement of the present study is that a cd-BME technique was introduced to reduce skewness effects in the spatiotemporal distribution of HFRS incidence data. This technique demonstrated a significant ability in modeling the pronounced variability in HFRS data caused by infection outbreaks that result in skewed distributions. Further, a moving windows configuration (Akita et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]2012) was used that focuses mainly on local information (this configuration provides an HFRS variability representation that is closer to the real-world infectious disease spread pattern and less variable than the global pattern). The original dataset was optimally divided into four classes based on percentiles, which while maintained all advantages of BME modeling of spatiotemporal dependencies and correlations, it made HFRS predictions more accurate and robust.</p><p>In this work we considered several models, before concluding that BME is the best one for the Heilongjiang study. For example, due to the presence of disease data with a considerable number of 0 values, the zero-inflated model with spatial random effect was considered, because it has been designed to handle over-dispersed data [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We first noticed that after applying this model, the distribution of the original data will change and the data values will be also modified as a result. Second, this model usually either requires certain impact factors (e.g., environmental or gender population features) for regression purposes or the neighbor disease data should be assumed to be the independent variable (regressor). The former possibility is not applicable in the present study because of the lack of such data. As regards the latter possibility, taking the neighbor data as input could account to a limited extent for purely spatial dependency. Yet, these <italic>ad hoc</italic> approximations are not necessary here, since the BME method not only can handle data with any kind of distribution but it also rigorously accounts for the spatial, temporal and composite space-time dependency of the data. Other drawbacks of the zero-inflated model with spatial random effect is that it is a &#x0201c;na&#x000ef;ve&#x0201d; interpolator (i.e., it does not account for the varying distances between data locations, and it is impossible to obtain informative space-time maps with finer resolution compared to the original dataset), and it cannot incorporate the disease spread indicators based on probability logic. BME has none of the above drawbacks (it is an adequate interpolator, i.e. it generates accurate estimates at unsampled locations that account for the varying distances between data locations and between the data and the interpolated locations, it generates informative space-time maps with fine resolution, and it incorporates the probabilistic disease indicators).</p><p>We concluded that the living conditions of rodents can dominate HFRS epidemics, as they influence the rodents-human interaction rate. As regards the space-time mapping of HFRS incidences in Heilongjiang Province during 2005&#x02013;2013, the western part exhibits lower HFRS incidences than the eastern part. This is mainly due to environmental factors, as water resources expedite growth of plants, which serve as food and facilitate reproduction of rodents [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The aforementioned findings are in agreement with the broader picture of the river network in the region. More precisely, in Heilongjiang Province, only Neng River is located in the western part of Heilongjiang Province (i.e. lower HFRS incidences), whereas Wusuli River, Songhua River and Mudan River locate in the eastern part of the province (i.e. higher HFRS incidences) [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, the eastern and southeastern parts of Heilongjiang Province exhibit mixed land types with forests, favoring rodents&#x02019; reproduction. As a result, the eastern part of Heilongjiang Province demonstrates a consistently high level of HFRS infections throughout the year, whereas, the HFRS incidences in the western part of the province are dominated by monthly outbreaks. This is due to the fact that large proportions of the western part of the province are croplands, which remain flooded for crop growth purposes during the entire farming period, preventing rodents&#x02019; reproduction. A general overview of HFRS spread patterns in Heilongjiang Province can be obtained from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g005">Fig 5</xref>, as well as by the space-time maps in the supporting information (i.e. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007091.s012">S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007091.s020">S10</xref> Figs).</p><p>Another contribution of this work is in filling the gap in the quantitative modeling of the spatiotemporal HFRS transition mechanisms based on probability logic. In other words, the present study provides a solution to the problem of calculating HFRS spread across space-time. In this context, the proposed stochastic HFRS indicators were applied to estimate the probability of HFSR transmission between space-time domains exhibiting different infection levels as a function their spatial distance and time separation. The results of the Heilongjiang study suggested that the proposed stochastic HFRS indicators summarize well the space-time incidence patterns, and their physical meanings and interpretations of the proposed HFRS indicators provide useful information about the HFRS spread mechanisms in the Heilongjiang province during Jan 2005-Dec 2013. Some HFRS classes were found to be cross-correlated with apparent correlation ranges, but some classes were not cross-correlated in the usual sense (i.e., if classes occur at two distant parts of the Heilongjiang province, it may be appropriate to characterize their interclass relationship as non-adjacent). Each HFRS class has a relationship with any other class in the Heilongjiang province during Jan 2005-Dec 2013, and quantifying the spatiotemporal relationships between HFRS classes and incorporating them into disease analysis and mapping are help us realistic assessment of the real HFRS situation in the space-time domain of interest. The transition probabilities provided by the HFRS indicators describe the spatiotemporal arrangements between incidence classes and suggest interactions that can be explored further in detail.</p><p>The plots of the four indicators offer complementary visualizations of the variation of the different probabilities of transition between incidence classes, i.e., the probabilities with which the different levels of HFRS incidences occur next to each other and so they describe the dependency pattern of the space-time arrangement of the HFRS patches occupied by the different incidence classes. Specifically, key features of interclass HFRS incidence relationships observed in this work are the space-time dependency, level of juxtaposition, and directional asymmetry of class patterns. The categorical HFRS incidences in the Heilongjiang province during Jan 2005-Dec 2013 exhibit rather smooth intraclass but complex interclass relationships. The complementary character of HFRS indicators of intraclass and interclass incidence transition and the estimated proportions of regional cover by each incidence class showed the dominance of the incidence class <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub> with which all the other classes are associated. Indeed, the HFRS incidence class <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub> covered about 68% of the total area, wheres the fact that the transition probabilities from the classes <italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>4</sub> individually to class <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub> are high suggests that the incidence class <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub> dominated the Heilongjiang region. This phenomenon indicated that, independently of the particular infection level, the HFRS spread is dominated by point outbreaks with relatively small spatial ranges of influence. In other words, if an HFRS outbreak occurs at one location, it is necessary for the public health management to focus on in-situ HFRS prevention and control, as a measure to prevent further spread. This also reflects that the main pathway of HFRS infection is from rodents to humans, rather from person-to-person interaction [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the latter case, an HFRS outbreak would spread in much larger areas. Using the findings of spatiotemporal HFRS spread patterns, public health management can also determine the critical temporal and spatial scales for HFRS prevention and control. For example, if HFRS incidences at some location are identified to belong to class 2, effective measures should be taken for a period of approximately three months and within a radial distance of approximately 50 km (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g007">Fig 7b</xref>).</p><p>Certain quantitative findings of this work are in line with previous qualitative assessments. For example, based on the finding of the previous studies HFRS incidences are closely associated with environmental factors, a finding that confirms, in part, the suggestions made by [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Given BME&#x02019;s methodological features to assimilate secondary information and auxiliary variables (e.g., [<xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), future work should focus on integrating environmental factors into BME analysis, to better understand HFRS spread patterns and provide more accurate predictions. The approach introduced in this work is likely to be valuable in comparisons of spatiotemporal incidence patterns at other regions of China or worldwide. Also, the same methodology could be used in the spatiotemporal modeling and mapping of other epidemics under similar in situ conditions, in which case the choice of the disease incidence classes could be linked to the specific public health purposes.</p><p>Future work should also focus on the current shortcomings of the proposed approach. One of them is the need for developing HFRS transition probabilities tests that could lead to stronger inferences regarding the interclass interactions suggested by these probabilities. Another is the relaxation of the space-time homostationarity assumption concerning HFRS spread, which may allow a more detailed assessment of the spatial anisotropy of transition probabilities as described by the HFRS indicators. Lastly, it must be kept in mind that real-world computations usually process datasets of potentially widely varying levels of uncertainty. As a result, in most cases the computational results may not satisfy exactly the theoretical assumptions. Instead, they are expected to strike a balance between theoretical rigor and computational cost is acceptable for practical purposes, which leaves room for potential improvement of the computational component of the proposed analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
