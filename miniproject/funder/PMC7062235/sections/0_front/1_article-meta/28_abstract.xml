 <p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has been a concern in Asian regions since the late 1990s. To disclose the transmission mechanism of HFMD and its driving factors, we combined epidemiological, spatial, and mathematical analysis, using HFMD cases in two provinces (Qinghai and Shanghai) of China as an example. We found the phenomenon of traveling waves in the process of HFMD transmission for the first time and identified different types of traveling waves associated with different driving factors. HFMD in Qinghai decline year by year with the characteristics of cross-region population mobility, while epidemics in Shanghai are persistent in the suburban areas with low incidence in the urban areas and neighboring population movement dominates the pattern. Our findings facilitate the understanding of HFMD transmission mechanisms over geographic regions, which are crucial for designing a jointly effective HFMD prevention and control strategy.</p>
