 <p>Birds play an important role in the epidemiology of flaviviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) since birds are natural hosts and facilitate hibernation of the virus in periods of absence of mosquitoes that transmit the virus. Since it has been proposed that magpies play an important role in an endemic WNV cycle in human habitats in Europe, we conducted the first experimental infection of magpie with the two WNV lineages currently circulating in Europe. We observed high susceptibility of magpie to WNV infection with virus titers higher than those necessary for the successful transmission of WNV to a mosquito and often resulting in death. Likewise, we detected elevated titers of neutralizing antibodies in all the samples tested as well as the viral genome in the organs, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and feather pulps of the infected animals. Our results suggest that the magpie, which is one of the most abundant corvid species in Europe, could be a source of WNV transmission to other birds and humans, which expands the knowledge about WNV pathogenesis, transmission and ecology, that benefits monitoring and control programs.</p>
