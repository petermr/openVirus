<p>Access to anonymized individual health records was obtained through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-term Care (MOHLTC) and Statistics Canada. The MoU defined a joint project on enhancing access to Ontario health data by the research community. Administrative databases were made available by MOHLTC to Statistics Canada, who facilitated record linkage by providing an encrypted health insurance number (EHIN) in each record. Files were made available to us in the Statistics Canada Research Data Centre (RDC) at McMaster University.</p>
