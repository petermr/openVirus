 <p>Hepatitis E virus is a leading cause of acute viral hepatitis in developing countries. About 20% of those infected develop clinical symptoms; of those, about 2% of non-pregnant cases and 20% of pregnant cases die. There is a safe and effective HEV vaccine that is licensed in China for those aged 16–65 years who are not pregnant. The potential for using this vaccine in outbreak settings has not previously been examined. We analysed data from one of the world’s largest recorded HEV epidemics. We estimated that one case infects, on average, between 4 and 9 others at the start of an epidemic. We found that vaccination restricted to those aged 16–65 who are not pregnant could reduce mortality in outbreak settings by between about 10 and 30% if used reactively (initiating vaccination after the start of an epidemic); pre-emptive vaccination of the same group could reduce mortality by 35–65%. Substantially higher reductions in mortality are likely if vaccination can be safely extended to pregnant women and other age groups without loss of effectiveness. However, even if this is possible, reactive vaccination is unlikely to reduce mortality by more than 50% while pre-emptive vaccination can reduce mortality by 80 to 100%.</p>
