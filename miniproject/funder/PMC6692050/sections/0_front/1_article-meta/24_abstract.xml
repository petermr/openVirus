 <p>In Peru and other dog rabies-affected countries, mass dog vaccination campaigns (MDVC) are implemented primarily through fixed-location vaccination points: owners have to bring their dogs to the vaccination points where they receive the vaccination. To stop rabies virus transmission, a high and even dog vaccination coverage is desired. In Arequipa, Peru, following a MDVC, we conducted a door-to-door survey of &gt;6,000 houses to assess how the placement of vaccination points affected coverage of the campaign. When comparing dog owners with similar characteristics, we found that the odds of participating in the MDVC was reduced by 16% for every 100 m distance from the nearest vaccination point. Some social conditions were also associated with participating in the MDVC: for each child under 5 in the household, odds of participating in the MDVC decreased by 13%, and for each decade less lived in the area, the odds of participating in the MDVC decreased by 8%. Distance to the vaccination point and variation in social conditions across the city play important roles in achieving coverage of MDVC and should be considered during campaign planning and evaluation.</p>
