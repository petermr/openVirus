<p>With the stochastic model, we projected outbreak size and duration of probable and confirmed cases. In the absence of any vaccination program, the projected median outbreak size was 213.0 cases (mean 360.2; 95% prediction interval: 64.8, 1450.2). Median duration of projected outbreaks was 175.0 days (mean 182.8; 95% prediction interval: 86.0, 282.0). Using a lower estimate of 44% vaccination coverage, the median outbreak size was 104.0 cases (mean 118.8; 95% prediction interval: 58.0, 271.0) and median duration was 121.0 days (mean 124.6; 95% prediction interval: 74.0, 187.0). Using a higher estimate of 62% vaccination coverage, the median size was 82.0 EVD cases (mean 88.1; 95% prediction interval: 55.0, 156.0), and the median duration was 101.0 days (mean 103.4; 95% prediction interval: 68.0, 153.0). These projections with the stochastic model were repeated to estimate suspected, probable and confirmed cases
