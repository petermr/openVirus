RVFV virulence depends on the interferon antagonist non-structural protein (NSs), which remains poorly characterized. We identified a stable core domain of RVFV NSs (residues 83&#x02013;248), and solved its crystal structure, a novel all-helical fold organized into highly ordered fibrils. A hallmark of RVFV pathology is NSs filament formation in infected cell nuclei. Recombinant virus encoding the NSs core domain induced intranuclear filaments, suggesting it contains all essential determinants for nuclear translocation and filament formation. Mutations of key crystal fibril interface residues in viruses encoding full-length NSs completely abrogated intranuclear filament formation in infected cells. We propose the fibrillar arrangement of the NSs core domain in crystals reveals the molecular basis of assembly of this key virulence factor in cell nuclei. Our findings have important implications for fundamental understanding of RVFV virulence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is a virus of humans and livestock, transmitted by mosquitos and contact with infected animals. Infection can cause severe disease, including hemorrhagic fever, and may lead to death. Historically, the virus was only found in central Africa but it has spread for instance to the Arabian Peninsula. There is a risk that the virus may appear in temperate regions including Europe because global warming is allowing the mosquitos that carry the virus to extend their geographic range. There are no vaccines or treatments available for use in humans so if there is a serious outbreak of the virus it could become an epidemic and cause great economic losses and severe human disease.</p><p>RVFV relies on a protein called NSs to cause disease. In cells of infected animals and humans NSs forms filaments inside the nucleus, the control center of the cell, and disarms the immune system. However, it is not known precisely how NSs works.</p><p>To address this question, Barski, Brennan et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the atomic three-dimensional structure of NSs. This revealed that the center of the protein contains a core domain that causes the filaments to form. Further experiments identified how the NSs core comes together to build the filaments inside the cell nucleus.</p><p>These findings represent an important step towards understanding how the NSs protein helps RVFV to cause disease in humans and livestock. In the future, this work may aid the development of much needed drugs and vaccines against RVFV.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rift valley fever virus</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>virulence factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDTG11 - MR/J500343/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barski</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwarz-Linek</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>099220/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brennan</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000332</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of Edinburgh</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Caledonian Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Ona K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Insight into the molecular assembly of a protein with a central role in infections paves the way to understanding how Rift Valley fever virus causes disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV), of the genus <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>, is one of the most clinically significant members of the <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family, of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Elliott and Brennan, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Plyusnin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2017</xref>). RVFV is an arbovirus spread by many mosquito vector species as well as by exposure to infected tissues. It causes recurring epidemics in livestock and humans (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ikegami and Makino, 2011</xref>). The most prominent effect of RVFV infection in ruminants is a high rate of abortions. In humans infections are usually self-limiting, but can develop into hepatitis, retinitis, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever with fatality rates of 0.5&#x02013;2% (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pepin et al., 2010</xref>). Although originally endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, RVFV has recently appeared in Madagascar, the Comoros and the Arabian Peninsula (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balkhy and Memish, 2003</xref>). Increasing spread of competent mosquito vector species due to climate change could facilitate emergence of this virus in new ecosystems, including Europe and the United States (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chevalier, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Elliott, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Golnar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rolin et al., 2013</xref>). In 2017 the World Health Organization ranked RVFV among the ten most dangerous pathogens most likely to cause wide epidemics in the near future, requiring urgent attention (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/en/">http://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/en/</ext-link>). While an animal vaccine for RVFV exists, there is no treatment available for human use (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Boshra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Lihoradova and Ikegami, 2014</xref>).</p><p>RVFV is a zoonotic arbovirus evolved to evade the immune response of mammals and insects. Innate immune antagonism of RVFV is primarily mediated by its main virulence factor, the 30 kDa non-structural protein (NSs), which is transcribed and translated from a subgenomic mRNA derived from the antigenomic S segment early during infection. NSs impedes interferon production through three known mechanisms (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Billecocq et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bouloy et al., 2001</xref>). In infected host cells, NSs is transported into the nucleus where it interferes with the assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex transcription factor II H (TFIIH) by binding to the p44 subunit (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2004</xref>) and directing the p62 subunit for degradation (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kainulainen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kalveram et al., 2011</xref>), thereby halting global cellular transcription. NSs also prevents activation of the interferon-&#x003b2; promoter specifically by binding to factor SAP30, a member of a multisubunit histone deacetylase transcriptional repression complex that regulates interferon-&#x003b2; expression (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, NSs blocks host recognition of viral dsRNA by targeting the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) for degradation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ikegami et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>). RVFV with a deletion of NSs cannot establish viremia and is not pathogenic in the mouse model (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bouloy et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>A characteristic feature of RVFV pathogenesis is formation of 0.5 &#x003bc;m thick proteinaceous filaments formed by bundles of thin fibrils in the nuclei of infected cells (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Swanepoel and Blackburn, 1977</xref>). The filaments are composed primarily of NSs protein (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Struthers and Swanepoel, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Yadani et al., 1999</xref>) but co-localize with p44, XPB, SAP30 and YY1, as well (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). It is not clear if filament formation is required for NSs function, that&#x000a0;is if any interaction sites are present on the monomeric form of the protein, or are only present in the multimerized, fibrillar NSs. In the absence of structural information it is difficult to dissect NSs function from filament formation. Potential functions of nuclear NSs filaments include sequestering NSs binding partners, causing cell cycle arrest and defects in chromosome cohesion and segregation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mansuroglu et al., 2010</xref>). This could contribute to the high rate of fetal deformities and abortions observed in RVFV-infected ruminants (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mansuroglu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>NSs proteins are encoded in the S segment of the tripartite negative sense single strand RNA genome of most members of the <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus, and other families of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order such as the <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, <italic>Nairoviridae</italic>, and some members of the <italic>Hantaviridae</italic> (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ly and Ikegami, 2016</xref>). They constitute notoriously difficult targets for structural characterization due to an inherent tendency to multimerize, as well as the putative presence of substantial intrinsically unfolded regions. While high-resolution structures of glycoproteins (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dessau and Modis, 2013</xref>) and nucleoproteins (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Raymond et al., 2010</xref>) from RVFV and several other bunyaviruses have been determined, no structural information is currently available for any NSs protein, significantly limiting the current understanding of key bunyaviral virulence mechanisms. Structure and function can also not be predicted based on sequence, as NSs proteins are &#x02018;ORFans&#x02019;, with very little sequence similarity in members of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order and the <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus. Despite large sequence diversity, NSs proteins examined thus far have been found to play roles in the suppression of the host innate immune response. However, this and the diverse mechanisms of NSs function have been studied only for a few viruses.</p><p>Here we describe the first high-resolution structure of a bunyaviral NSs protein. A truncated stable, soluble core domain spanning residues 83&#x02013;248 of RVFV NSs (NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C) was identified using NMR spectroscopy. The corresponding crystal structure represents a novel all-helical fold. Notably, NSs molecules packed in crystals in double-helical fibrils stabilized by multiple interfaces. Dimensions of these fibrils are in good agreement with fibrils constituting nuclear NSs filaments in RVFV-infected cells. Cells infected with recombinant RVFV encoding NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C produced nuclear filaments indistinguishable from filaments observed in cells infected with parental RVFV. Furthermore, recombinant viruses encoding full-length NSs with mutations predicted to destabilize significant fibril interfaces, as suggested by crystal packing, did not induce nuclear filaments. Combination of structural biology with cell infection assays using reverse genetics to tailor the main RVFV virulence factor identified a RVFV NSs core domain sufficient for filament formation in vivo, and revealed the structural basis for NSs nuclear filament formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NSs contains a stable central core and a disordered C-terminal tail</title><p>Full-length NSs protein (residues 1&#x02013;265) was expressed as a cleavable MBP fusion yielding only a small amount (about 0.1 mg per litre of culture) of soluble protein after removal of MBP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed secondary and tertiary structure in mature NSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>), however the protein formed large soluble aggregates, eluting in the void volume of size exclusion chromatography (mass over 200 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This construct was therefore redesigned in order to obtain a stable, non-aggregating and soluble fragment of NSs. Secondary structure predictions suggested an N-terminal region with a propensity to form &#x003b2; sheet structure (residues 1&#x02013;70), connected by an unstructured linker to a central &#x003b1;-helical domain (85-230). The C-terminal region was predicted to be natively unfolded (231-265). Deletion of the N-terminal 82 amino acids (resulting in truncated NSs hereafter referred to as NSs-&#x00394;N, residues 83&#x02013;265) significantly improved expression yields, solubility and stability.

The F1 and F2 crisscross pattern is produced by F1 fibrils running in parallel to each other and the longest unit cell edge, while F2 fibrils are oriented at an angle of 60&#x000b0; with respect to each other, perpendicular to F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>). F1 and F2 fibrils themselves are best described as being composed of repeating NSs tetramer units. Four different, partially overlapping (or alternative) tetramers T1, T2, T3 and T4 can be distinguished that differ in stability and interface areas, according to PISA interface analyses (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>), with T1 being the most stable tetramer (<xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). F1 is an assembly of T1 tetramers stacked at 60&#x000b0; angles, while F2 is composed of alternating T1 and T2 tetramers arranged at 90&#x000b0; angles with respect to each other. The T1 interface that lies parallel to the F1 fibril is largely determined by hydrophobic packing of the &#x003b1;6 helices. The T1 interface perpendicular to the&#x000a0;F1 fibril axis is defined by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the basic face of &#x003b1;1 (Lys84, Gln87, Arg88) and the acidic face of &#x003b1;8 (Glu220, Glu221, Ser228), leading to a large buried interface area of 4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;852 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The superficially very similar tetramer T2 in F2 fibrils is less stable. Here the molecules are rotated by about 8&#x000b0; with respect to the orientation of the equivalent monomers in T1, and form a twisted tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>). The register of the &#x003b1;6-&#x003b1;6 interface is shifted, decreasing the buried surface area by 169 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> compared to the same interface in T1. The total buried surface area is nearly 1000 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (17%) smaller in T2 than in T1. The B factors for T2 are also notably higher than for T1, suggesting that interfaces in T1, and therefore F1, possess a higher degree of conformational order, contributing to a higher stability of this assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).

Fibrillation was observed only in about 30% of cells infected with rMP12NSs&#x00394;N&#x00394;C, compared to occurrence of filaments in nearly all cells infected with parental virus.</p><fig id="fig6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29236.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Intracellular localization of NSs in rMP12- or rMP12NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C-infected Vero-E6 cells.</title><p>Cells were fixed 24 h p.i. and co-stained with either anti-N or anti-NSs antibodies (green) as indicated and DAPI (blue).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-29236-fig6"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Engineering of interfaces observed in NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C crystals prevents NSs filament formation in infected cells</title><p>To test if the fibrillar crystal packing observed for NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C represents a biologically relevant assembly underpinning intranuclear NSs filament formation, combinations of two key residues in three different crystal interfaces were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Residues were chosen that were predicted to be critical for assembly of tetramers present in both or either F1 and F2 fibrils, but not essential for monomer stability. Three NSs variants were generated: NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C-muT1 (Arg88Asp, Ser228Ala), NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C-muT3 (Lys150Gly, Thr152Gly) and NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C-muT4 (Ile216Asp, Met219Ala). Disruption of the polar T1 interface, perpendicular to F1, would interrupt both T1 and T2, and therefore F1 and F2. Residue Arg88, forming two salt bridges to Glu220 and Glu221, was mutated to an aspartate. Ser228, forming a side-chain hydrogen bond with Gln87, was replaced by alanine. The T3 interface, unique to F1, was targeted through replacement of Lys150 and Thr152 with glycines. The hydrophobic T4 interface, formed by the &#x003b1;8 helices of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystals, is unique to F2; it was changed by mutating Ile216 to aspartate and Met219 to alanine. These two residues contribute about 50% of the total buried surface area to the &#x003b1;8-&#x003b1;8 interface.</p><p>NMR spectroscopy was used to assess the effect of these mutations on the folded state of NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C in solution. <sup>1</sup>H spectra agreed with conservation of structure in all mutated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>). All spectra showed the same signal dispersion and no indications of significant changes in structure, such as partial unfolding. High-field shifted methyl signals between &#x02212;1 and 0 ppm were observed at the same chemical shifts in all spectra. Such signals belong to buried aliphatic side-chains, and conservation of their chemical shifts reflects preservation of the hydrophobic packing in the protein variants.</p><p>Three recombinant viruses encoding full-length NSs containing interface mutations were rescued, rMP12muT1NSs, rMP12muT3NSs, and rMP12muT4NSs. Recombinant viruses grew to similar titers to that of the parental virus rMP12 and had indistinguishable plaque morphologies. Segment specific RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the genomic composition of recombinant viruses. NSs-specific immunofluorescence staining showed the presence of filaments in nuclei of rMP12mut4NSs infected Vero-E6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, no filaments were observed in nuclei of cells infected with rMP12muT1NSs and rMP12muT3NSs. In both cases NSs was detected as speckles or diffusely dispersed throughout the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data indicate that all three NSs variants had retained the ability to be imported into nuclei. Mutating interfaces observed in the F1 crystal fibril clearly affected intranuclear NSs filament formation, whereas mutating an interface unique to the F2 fibril did not. Therefore, we conclude that the F1 crystal fibril is not only more stable than F2, but that it also represents the architecture of NSs in intranuclear filaments.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29236.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Intracellular localization of NSs in Vero-E6 cells infected with rMP12 or rMP12 variants encoding NSs variants with interface residue mutations (muT1, muT3, muT4).</title><p>Cells were fixed 24 h p.i. and co-stained with either anti-N or anti-NSs antibodies (green) as indicated and DAPI (blue).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-29236-fig7"/><p content-type="supplemental-figure"><fig id="fig7s1" specific-use="child-fig" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29236.019</object-id><label>Figure 7&#x02014;figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>1D 1 hr NMR spectra of NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C and interface mutation variants.</title><p>Asterisks indicate distinct high-field shifted methyl resonances with conserved chemical shifts in all variants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-29236-fig7-figsupp1"/></fig></p></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Innate immune antagonism is a common function of many viral non-structural proteins (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Randall and Goodbourn, 2008</xref>), including NSs proteins from bunyaviruses (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Walter and Barr, 2011</xref>).

Naturally occurring RVFV clone 13 encoding NSs lacking residues 16&#x02013;198 (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 1995</xref>), and a recombinant virus deficient of NSs, are currently candidates for live-attenuated vaccines for RVFV (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bird et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bird et al., 2011</xref>). The mode of action of RVFV NSs is understood to an extent. Several binding partners have been identified, and models for NSs function proposed (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ly and Ikegami, 2016</xref>). The underlying mechanisms of these interactions are however unknown, arguably because so far NSs proteins have largely evaded molecular and structural characterization. Here we report the first structure of a bunyaviral NSs protein.</p><p>Recombinant full-length RVFV NSs was found to form large aggregates in solution, and was not suitable for NMR or crystallography. Therefore, we designed a stable construct amenable to crystallization through double deletion of 82 N-terminal and 17 C-terminal residues (NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C). Both these regions had previously been linked to biological functions of NSs, particularly its intranuclear localization and fibrillation (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Yadani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Billecocq et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cyr et al., 2015</xref>). However, we demonstrate that a recombinant virus containing NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C successfully induces filament assembly in nuclei of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating neither the truncated N- or C-terminal regions are required for fibrillation.</p><p>NSs does not contain any nuclear localization signals, thus nuclear import likely relies on host proteins such as the p44 subunit of the TFIIH transcription complex (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2004</xref>). Interaction sites for any such binding partners are predicted to be near the N-terminus, since mutation of a PxxP putative protein interaction motif (residues 29&#x02013;32) results in retention of NSs in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Billecocq et al., 2004</xref>). Our data, however, show that the N-terminal 82 residues of NSs (including the 29&#x02013;32 motif) are dispensable for nuclear localization.</p><p>Deletion of 17 C-terminal residues was based on 2D NMR of NSs-&#x00394;N showing the presence of an intrinsically unfolded region. Notably, this truncation matches one reported in a study where RVFV NSs lacking these C-terminal residues (encoded by recombinant Semliki Forest virus) was localized in nuclei of infected cells, but did not form filaments (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Yadani et al., 1999</xref>). A more recent study suggests the 261-FVEV-264 motif is the binding site for the TFIIH subunit p62, and this interaction is required for filament formation (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cyr et al., 2015</xref>). While the C-terminal tail (including the FVEV motif) is missing in the NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C construct, we nevertheless observed intranuclear filaments indistinguishable from filaments in rMP12-infected cells. Therefore, neither the intrinsically disordered C-terminal nor the N-terminal regions of NSs are required for filament formation.</p><p>The discrepancies between published results and our findings regarding the terminal regions of NSs may be reconciled if a role for the N-terminal domain of NSs in self-association is considered. The N-terminal domain is included in the NSs constructs used in both studies cited above (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cyr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Yadani et al., 1999</xref>) that suggest a critical role of the C-terminal tail for NSs self-association. However, removal of the N-terminal domain had a clear effect on the oligomeric state of NSs-&#x00394;N, where the C-terminal tail is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In crystal fibrils, NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C N- and C-termini are close to an apparent cleft in the middle of tetramer T1, which could accommodate the N-terminal domain, assuming full-length NSs fibrils contain the same core-domain arrangement. In which case, intermolecular interactions between monomer terminal regions are likely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>). Arguably, deletion of either N- or C-terminal regions results in non-native interactions that destabilize fibrils, artifacts abrogated in a doubly truncated construct.</p><p>Our data have implications for understanding the interaction between NSs and TFIIH. The model for NSs function previously proposed (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cyr et al., 2015</xref>) assumes initial binding of NSs to p62, with subsequent disintegration of the TFIIH complex, followed by sequestration of p44 into NSs filaments (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2004</xref>). This hypothesis is not supported by our findings, as NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C lacks the putative p62-binding motif and still yields filaments. The apparent similarity in size and shape of NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C filaments to full-length NSs does not allow conclusions about their composition. We cannot rule out the possibility that NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C filaments observed in vivo are lacking other proteins such as p44 possibly associated with full-length NSs filaments.</p><p>The NSs core domain structure reported here represents a novel fold. Comparison of the secondary structure distribution in NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C and secondary structure predictions for other phleboviral NSs proteins shows very good agreement, suggesting that, despite low to moderate sequence identity of this core region (15&#x02013;32%), all phleboviral NSs proteins share a similar core domain fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). They do however vary greatly in their N- and C-terminal regions, which is particularly evident when comparing NSs from viruses transmitted by mosquitos and sandflies (e.g. RVFV, sandfly fever viruses) with viruses transmitted by ticks (e.g. Heartland phlebovirus and SFTS phlebovirus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29236.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment of NSs proteins from human-pathogenic phleboviruses (SFTS, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus).</title><p>Secondary structure elements for RVFV-NSs are shown on top of the alignment panels.

Mutagenic analyses of interfaces defining the two types of crystal fibrils suggested that F1 likely represents the core architecture of NSs filaments, while F2 is a crystal packing artifact. T1 and T3 interface NSs variants were both detected in nuclei of infected cells. In immunofluorescence staining the muT3 interface variant appeared to be much more abundant than the muT1 variant, suggesting that the muT3 variant of NSs may be more stable than the muT1 interface mutant. This agrees with the predicted stability of the T1 tetramer (<xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), making it less prone to degradation. To our knowledge, no other <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> causes intranuclear filament formation, and none of the residues stabilizing interfaces among NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C crystal fibrils is conserved in NSs sequences of phleboviruses other than RVFV.</p><p>Biological relevance of the F1 fibril is also supported by accessibility of the &#x003b1;8 helix in this assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 3</xref>), which is partially buried in the F2-specific T1-T2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This helix harbors a binding site for SAP30, a component of a repressor complex that regulates transcription of the interferon-&#x003b2; promoter (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2008</xref>). NSs arranged in the manner observed in NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C crystals would be able to bind to SAP30 and modulate SAP30 function.</p><p>PISA interface analysis indicates that potentially some NSs-&#x00394;N&#x00394;C oligomers, but neither F1 nor F2 fibrils would be stable in solution. This agrees with the observation that NSs is distributed throughout the cytoplasm at early time points in cell infection experiments, and only forms distinct filaments inside nuclei. Fibrillation therefore depends on factors present in the nucleus, but not the cytosol. Essential factors could be binding partners, but also other conditions that shift the association equilibrium of NSs towards fibrils such as the excluded volume effect, or molecular crowding, which plays a role in compartmentalization and architecture of cell nuclei (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hancock, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al., 2008</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that intranuclear crowding conditions are mimicked in crystallization where an excluded volume effect is induced by the precipitant polyethylene glycol (PEG).</p><p>RVFV is one of the most dangerous human pathogens with the potential to cause wide epidemics in the near future. The first high-resolution structure for the main RVFV virulence factor NSs and other data presented here will facilitate a deeper understanding of NSs function. Ongoing research will help determine if NSs filament assembly is required for virulence, a question that this study does not attempt to answer. NSs proteins of phleboviruses and other members of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order are highly diverse in sequence, but all play roles in suppressing the innate immune response through various mechanisms (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ly and Ikegami, 2016</xref>). In infected cells, NSs proteins are located in the nuclei and cytosol, or the cytosol only. Currently no other NSs protein is known to cause filaments characteristic for RVFV. To establish whether this unique property of RVFV NSs is related to virulence may require animal models, since NSs is dispensable for viral replication and in vitro cell infection, but is required to cause pathology (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bouloy et al., 2001</xref>). The structure-based insights presented here should facilitate such studies. Development of modulators of fibril formation may be an attractive option for new therapeutics, especially given the conservation of interface residues in RVFV isolates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Expression constructs were prepared by cloning RVFV strain MP12 cDNA comprising full-length (residues 1&#x02013;265), &#x00394;N (residues 83&#x02013;265), and &#x00394;N&#x00394;C (residues 83&#x02013;248) regions of NSs into a modified pMal-C2x vector (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag downstream of the <italic>malE</italic> (MBP) gene and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease sequence.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article "Rift Valley fever virus NSs protein core domain structure suggests molecular basis for pathogenic nuclear filaments" for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yorgo Modis (Reviewer #1); Jason Mclellan (Reviewer #2), Richard J Kuhn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>In this study Barski et al. describe the crystal structure of the non-structural protein NSs from Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) of the Bunyaviridae. NSs is an important virulence factor that impedes interferon production by at least three mechanisms: binding to the p44 subunit of TFIIH; binding to SAP30; and targeting the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR for degradation. Moreover, RVFV NSs forms nuclear filaments, which have been reported to associate with pericentromeric DNA, potentially causing chromosomal segregation defects.</p><p>The authors identified a soluble monomeric fragment of NSs using gel filtration and NMR. The 2.2 &#x000c5; structure of the NSs core was determined by phasing with sulfur anomalous signals, and was found to be a novel fold consisting of 8 &#x003b1;-helices. In the crystal, NSs forms two types of fibrils, each with two-start helical symmetry. The authors demonstrated that these fibrils have diameters similar to those observed by thin-section EM in Vero-E6 cells infected with RVFV. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that RVFV containing the crystallized fragment of NSs formed similar nuclear filaments as wild-type RVFV. However, viruses containing an NSs gene with either of two structure-based mutations aimed at disrupting the "F1"-type fibril-forming contacts did not form any nuclear filaments in infected cells. The viruses bearing the mutant proteins grew to similar titers and had similar plaque morphologies as the wild-type. The authors conclude that the F1 fibril-forming interface in the crystal (the stronger of the two interfaces) corresponds to the physiological interface responsible for NSs filament formation during RVFV infection. The authors note that the N- and C-terminal tails containing putative protein interaction regions, including the putative SAP30 interaction region, are exposed on the surface of F1 NSs fibrils.</p><p>This manuscript is clear and very well written. The structural studies are excellent, as is the analysis of the fibrils found in the lattice. The figures are clear, and they helped to convey the three-dimensional lattice and fibril interactions. The structure of the RVFV bunyaviral NSs protein is important and will help the field better understand the function of this key virulence factor. The identification of a soluble and crystallizable NSs fragment that can form physiologically relevant fibril contacts in the crystal is a technical achievement.</p><p>The reviewers recognize that a weakness of this study is that it does not address the question of whether filament formation is important for NSs function. The authors speculate that the NSs fibrils may promote infection by sequestering NSs binding partners, but it remains unclear whether NSs filaments have any proviral activity beyond that of soluble NSs. Indeed, the finding that the NSs-mutant RVFVs do not form NSs filaments but have the same infectivity as wild-type virus in cell culture, and the lack of conservation of fibril-forming residues in NSs in other phleboviruses (despite predicted conservation of the overall fold of NSs in the genus), suggest that NSs filament formation may not play a fundamental role in the viral replication cycle. Additionally, although the site-directed mutagenesis lends support to the authors' conclusion that the F1 fibrils represent the architecture of NSs filaments in vivo, the data do not rule out the possibility that the native full-length NSs filaments have an alternative conformation in vivo. While recognizing these limitations of the present work, we have concluded that the paper represents a sufficient level of new information concerning this important virus for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major Comment:</p><p>Given the reservations expressed above, we ask that the title be modified to remove the adjective "pathogenic" with regard to the nuclear filaments. In addition, we also ask that the Discussion section of the paper be edited to bring up the limitations of the study, as discussed above, making it clear to the reader that the relevance of the fibrils for diseases causation remains to be established. We note that the structural information provided here should facilitate such studies, a point that the authors could make to balance the principal weakness of the work, while not ignoring that weakness.</p><p>Other comments to address:</p><p>1) What is the rationale for naming the tetramers T1-T4?

We added a statement to the end of the Discussion to highlight that this study did not attempt to establish a role of NSs filament formation for pathogenicity, and that this is a clear limitation of our work. Establishing the role of filament formation for virulence, which may require animal models, is beyond the scope of our structural and cell-based approach. For instance the observation of similar plaque sizes caused by virus variants studied here does not shed light on the role of NSs filaments in pathogenesis, since NSs protein is not required for viral replication and cell infection. However lack of NSs results in loss of virulence in animal models. We believe the structural data and insight into the molecular determinants of NSs polymerization will greatly facilitate future studies aimed at understanding the role of NSs filaments. It will help answering the questions why RVFV appears to be the only virus inducing such filaments, and if this is in any way linked with the unique spectrum of pathologies associated with RVFV infections, in particular fetal deformities and abortions, which are a hallmark of RVFV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments to address:</p><p>1) What is the rationale for naming the tetramers T1-T4?
