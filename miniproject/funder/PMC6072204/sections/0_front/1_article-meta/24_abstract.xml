 <p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a vector-borne virus that infects wildlife and livestock, and can subsequently spread to humans. Due to the nature of the disease it has the potential to cause substantial economic and public health impacts. Rift Valley Fever (RVF) has been identified in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but has the potential to spread more widely. This systematic review assessed the distribution of RVF in livestock and humans in Africa by collating all the relevant studies we could find, extracting the data and critically evaluating them. Understanding when and where RVF has occurred in Africa and why some animals and humans get disease helps target control strategies and, in particular, those that reduce spread from livestock to humans. Furthermore, by evaluating past studies we can ensure that future ones are more robust and reproducible, so they can help us better understand the disease.</p>
