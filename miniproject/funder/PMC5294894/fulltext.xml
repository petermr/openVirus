Laboratory PCR is accurate but takes at least 24&#x000a0;h to generate a result to clinicians and antigen-based point-of-care tests (POCT) lack sensitivity. Rapid molecular platforms, such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, have equivalent diagnostic accuracy to laboratory PCR and can generate a result in 1&#x000a0;h making them deployable as POCT. Molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in hospital has the potential to improve the detection rate of respiratory viruses, improve the use of influenza antivirals and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but high quality randomised trials with clinically relevant endpoints are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The ResPOC study is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in adults with acute respiratory illness presenting to a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Eligible participants are adults presenting with acute respiratory illness to the emergency department or the acute medicine unit. Participants are allocated 1:1 by internet-based randomisation service to either the intervention of a nose and throat swab analysed immediately on the FilmArray Respiratory Panel as a POCT or receive routine clinical care. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. Secondary outcomes include turnaround time, virus detection, neuraminidase inhibitor use, length of hospital stay and side room use. Analysis of the primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat and all enrolled participants will be included in safety analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Multiple novel molecular POCT platforms for infections including respiratory viruses have been developed and licensed in the last few years and many more are in development but the evidence base for clinical benefit above standard practice is minimal. This randomised controlled trial aims to close this evidence gap by generating high quality evidence for the clinical impact of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses in secondary care and to act as an exemplar for future studies of molecular POCT for infections. This study has the potential to change practice and improve patient care for patients presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study was registered with ISRCTN, number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN90211642">ISRCTN90211642</ext-link>, on 14th January 2015.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Point-of-care test</kwd><kwd>Influenza</kwd><kwd>Respiratory virus</kwd><kwd>Adult</kwd><kwd>Hospitalised</kwd><kwd>Acute respiratory illness</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000739</institution-id><institution>University of Southampton</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background and rationale</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Respiratory virus burden of disease</title><p>Respiratory tract infections are the second most common cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and viruses are the most frequently detected pathogens in acute respiratory illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics leading to excess hospitalisations and death mainly in the elderly and in patients with co-morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Annual seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended in at risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] however vaccine coverage rate is sub-optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and high quality evidence for significant protection in the elderly is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The rate of hospitalisation in adults with influenza has been estimated at 5 to 20 per 100,000 overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and may be as high as 1,200 per 100,000 in those over 85&#x000a0;years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hospitalisation and death result from the complications of influenza including pneumonia and exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In adult patients hospitalised with laboratory confirmed influenza, 10&#x02013;30% are admitted to critical care units and 3&#x02013;15% die in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with outcomes being predicted by co-morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Estimates of the burden of influenza virus infection in hospitalised adults have traditionally been based on the incidence of the influenza-like-illness syndrome (ILI, defined as fever of &#x0003e;38&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and new respiratory symptoms) rather than on laboratory confirmed influenza. ILI has poor sensitivity (around 50%) and specificity (0&#x02013;63%) for the diagnosis of influenza in hospitalised adults even during periods of peak activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Where estimates of disease burden are based on laboratory confirmed influenza, laboratory testing of patients is based on clinical suspicion of influenza and is generally targeted to patients with respiratory symptoms and fever. However, in addition to acute respiratory presentations, influenza may present as decompensated cardiovascular disease, collapse or diabetic emergencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For this reason many hospitalised cases of influenza are likely to remain undiagnosed. A recent Canadian study estimated that only around one in 14 ED visits due to influenza virus infection were correctly attributed to influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is likely, therefore, that the burden of influenza and other respiratory viruses amongst hospitalised adults and its economic impact have been under-estimated. In addition to influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses, cause acute exacerbations of COPD and asthma as well as other acute respiratory presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which lead to large numbers of hospitalisations every year and significant burdens upon healthcare systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Conventional rapid diagnostic tests</title><p>Rapid diagnostic tests for influenza, and other respiratory viruses, based on antigen detection in nasal samples have been available for many years but have been diagnostically inaccurate in adults, where sensitivity is around 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The poor sensitivity of these antigen-based tests limits their clinical utility and their use has not been associated with a reduction in antibiotic prescribing in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The current gold standard diagnostic test for respiratory viruses is laboratory performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which is highly sensitive and specific but has turnaround times of at least 24&#x000a0;h and requires specialist laboratory facilities and expertise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. New rapid, molecular tests have recently been developed, including the FilmArray Respiratory Panel. These molecular platforms are comparable in accuracy to laboratory PCR, without the need for specialist laboratory support and expertise, and can potentially be used as a point-of-care test (POCT), but the evidence for molecular POCT improving patient outcomes is weak.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>FilmArray Respiratory Panel</title><p>The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Utah, USA, owned by bioM&#x000e9;rieux) uses nested real-time PCR to detect 20 respiratory pathogens. The FilmArray requires only 2&#x000a0;min of &#x0201c;hands on&#x0201d; time and produces a test result in about one hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel is both FDA-cleared and CE IVD marked. The viral pathogens detected by the FilmArray Respiratory Panel are: Influenza A (untyped, A/H1, A/H1-2009, A/H3), Influenza B, Adenovirus, Coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43) Human Metapneumovirus, Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Parainfluenza (types 1, 2, 3, 4) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Three bacterial respiratory pathogens are also detected: <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The FilmArray respiratory panel is broadly equivalent in accuracy to laboratory PCR, and use has been validated on nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, lower respiratory tract samples, and samples from immunocompromised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Initial mediocre sensitivity for adenovirus detection has been greatly improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. All of these studies show favourable outcomes with FilmArray system, including reliability, accuracy, ease of use and turnaround time although these studies were conducted in a laboratory rather at the point-of-care and a disproportionate number of these studies were conducted from samples from children rather than adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Potential clinical impact of point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses</title><p>In hospitalised adults with acute respiratory illness, viruses are the most commonly detectable pathogen, with bacterial detection being much less frequent, although antibiotic use is almost universal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Antibiotic over-use is partly driven by clinical uncertainty as to the aetiology of the acute respiratory illness and so by early identification of viruses antibiotic use may be prevented.</p><p>A study examining clinical outcomes in children has shown that use of the FilmArray reduced the duration of antibiotic use, the length of inpatient stay, and the time in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, this was not a randomised controlled trial but examined outcomes pre- and post-implementation. To our knowledge, there have been no randomised controlled trials of this system as a point-of-care test examining the potential clinical and health economic benefits. Although there are data to suggest clinical benefits (in terms of duration of hospital stay, number of investigations, and antibiotic use) for use of rapid diagnostic tests of influenza and other respiratory viruses in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of such a strategy in adults are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>A Cochrane review evaluating the use of rapid antigen tests for acute respiratory illness in children in the emergency department concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to support rapid viral to reduce antibiotic use in this setting. The authors suggest an adequately powered trial with antibiotic use as the primary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Point-of-care testing in the wider context</title><p>The Department of Health commissioned Carter report into UK pathology services noted the importance of developing clinically relevant point-of-care diagnostic tests to reduce turnaround times and improve patient pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) document &#x02018;Management and Use of Point-of-Care Test Devices&#x02019; sets out the context in which POCT should be considered for use and provides guidelines for their successful and safe implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The objectives of this study are in line with these documents and it aims to examine the initial phase of a POCT programme: establishing a clinical need for the test and evaluating potential clinical benefits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Alignment with global research priorities</title><p>In addition to being focused on patient and healthcare organisation outcomes, this clinical research is strongly aligned with several global research priority initiatives including the World Health Organisation&#x02019;s Battle against Respiratory Viruses (BRaVe) initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and the global report into antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The BRaVe initiative aims to catalyse multidisciplinary research on strategies to prevent and treat medically important respiratory virus infections with the goal of timely integration of research advances into public health practice. Priority areas identified include improving diagnostic tests for viral respiratory illness and improving the clinical management of patients with acute respiratory viral illness which are both addressed by this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study aims and objectives</title><p>This study aims to prospectively evaluate whether use of a molecular point-of-care diagnostic test will improve clinical outcomes compared to routine clinical care, in adult patients presenting to the secondary care with acute respiratory illness.

Missing data was minimal in the pilot study and is not expected to be a significant issue; the use of multiple imputation will be considered should missing data exceed 10% in the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Data management</title><p>The study will be conducted in accordance with the approved protocol, ICH GCP relevant regulations and standard operating procedures. Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy in relation to source documents. Data from case report forms will be entered into a secure bespoke database at the completion of the study followed by data lock. All data will be anonymised: volunteer participant data will be identified by a unique study number in the CRF and database. A separate confidential file containing identifiable information will be stored in a secured location in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Only the Sponsor&#x02019;s representative and investigators will have access to the information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>This will be performed by a dedicated medical statistician from the University of Southampton independent from the study team. Patients tested with the rapid diagnostic test will be compared with patients treated by routine clinical care using standard descriptive and comparative statistical methods using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc; La Jolla, California) and SPSS (SPSS, Inc; Chicago, Illinois). Summaries of all baseline characteristics will be presented using means and standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges, or frequencies and percentages, as appropriate. Analysis of the primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat and will compare the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics using the chi-square test for equality of proportions between groups. The effect of group (intervention or control) on the primary outcome will be further assessed using logistic regression to control for demographics (age, sex) and other co-variables. For secondary outcomes the intervention and control groups will be compared using chi-square tests for equality of proportions for binary data (including proportions) and using t-tests and non-parametric equivalent tests for continuous data (e.g. turnaround time) as appropriate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Monitoring</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>The study was reviewed by the sponsor and felt to be of low risk on the grounds that it is not a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product and the low likelihood of harms associated with the intervention. Therefore the creation of a data monitoring committee was not felt necessary. No interim analysis of data is planned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Harms</title><p>The risks of nose and throat swabs and additional blood tests being taken are minimal and where occurring are likely to be mild. No additional adverse events s related to POCT for respiratory viruses are anticipated. However active monitoring and reporting of severe adverse events will be undertaken. Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined here as:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Death during admission or within 30&#x000a0;days of enrolment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Admission to the intensive care unit</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evidence of prolonged hospital stay</p></list-item><list-item><p>New or persistent significant disability or incapacity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evidence of congenital anomaly or birth defect</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>As participants in ED are not yet hospitalised but have a reasonable likelihood of being admitted to hospital, patients enrolled in ED who are subsequently admitted to the hospital will not automatically be counted as having experienced a SAE. Participants who are already admitted to AMU are already hospitalised however, an adverse event leading to prolongation of their existing hospitalisation will be counted as an SAE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Auditing</title><p>Regular monitoring will be performed according to ICH GCP by the sponsor. Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy in relation to source documents. Following written standard operating procedures, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Protocol amendments</title><p>All protocol modifications were communicated to investigators and to trial registries. Two amendments to the protocol have been approved by the ethics committee, the first, to change the study from a pilot study into a full study and to amend an exclusion criterion, the second, to add a laboratory analysis plan for the samples collected (current protocol version 3.0, date 26th January 2016). The local study reference is RHM MED1217.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>All data will be anonymised to protect participant confidentiality: volunteer participant data will be identified by a unique study number in the case report forms and database. Serious Adverse Events will be reported in line with Good Clinical Practice and regulatory requirements. All study staff are trained in Good Clinical Practice. Only the investigators and sponsor&#x02019;s representative (monitor) have access to the data, which is kept securely.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Access to data</title><p>The final data set will be wholly accessible to the principal investigator, co-investigators and independent statistician and may be made available to other parties on request.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p>Authorship of this and subsequent manuscripts stemming from this protocol will follow the ICMJE recommendations, and CONSORT statement where appropriate, and there is no intent to use professional writers. There are no plans to make the dataset publically available. Beyond the study team and regulatory oversight, the full protocol is only made available at the discretion of the chief investigator. The data and samples collected are expected to form multiple publications, and these publications must acknowledge this trial and study team as appropriate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Discussion</title><p>We hypothesise that molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses, in adults presenting to hospital with acute respiratory infection, will reduce antibiotic use, improve detection of influenza and use of neuraminidase inhibitors, improve isolation facility use and be safe.</p><p>This study has the potential to improve patient care by changing practice and contribute to a health economic analysis. The outcome measures are clinically important to a large number of patients, and also crucial in antimicrobial stewardship and healthcare resource management. As a randomised controlled trial, this study will provide high-quality evidence for the potential use of molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in hospitalised adults. Beyond this trial, molecular point-of-care testing for common pathogens in select populations, such as in intensive care, or other common illness presentations, such as gastroenteritis, needs to be evaluated to further improve patient care and effectively manage healthcare resources.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AMU</term><def><p>Acute medicine unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BRaVe</term><def><p>Battle against Respiratory Viruses (WHO initiative)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p>Emergency department</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>Good Clinical Practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International Conference on Harmonisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ILI</term><def><p>Influenza-like illness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>Polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POCT</term><def><p>Point-of-care test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the patients and staff in the Emergency Department and Acute Medicine Unit at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust in making this study possible.</p><sec id="FPar8"><title>Funding</title><p>
