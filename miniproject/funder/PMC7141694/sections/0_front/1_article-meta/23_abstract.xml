 <p>Chikungunya and Dengue viral infection are prevalent in South Asia. These are spread by mosquito bites and present as acute febrile illness with clinical presentation difficult to differentiate. In this study we analysed clinical findings of patients with lab confirmed Dengue virus and Chikungunya virus infection and compared the clinical symptoms to assess significant features that can differentiate the two infections at time of presentation to clinics and hospitals. The study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi Pakistan. Our study confirms presence of Chikungunya virus as an etiologic agent of fever among patients with dengue like illness in Sindh province of Pakistan. Presence of joint pains, central nervous symptoms were more common in CHKV patients, while gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated liver enzymes were more commonly associated with dengue patients. Both viruses are endemic in Pakistan and clinical and lab diagnosis is essential.</p>
