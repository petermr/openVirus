 <p>A simple and accurate reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for the detection of porcine pegivirus (PPgV). The specific RT-LAMP primers targeting the conserved regions of NS5A genes were designed and used to detect PPgV. The optimal reaction parameter for RT-LAMP assay was 63℃ for 60 min. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 10 copies of PPgV genome, which was 100 times more sensitive than that of the conventional RT-PCR and comparable to nested RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). There was no cross amplification with other related RNA viruses. In the clinical evaluation, the RT-LAMP assay exhibited a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. The results indicated that RT-LAMP assay developed in this study could be a highly specific, sensitive, and cost-effective alternative for a rapid detection of PPgV in field settings.</p>
