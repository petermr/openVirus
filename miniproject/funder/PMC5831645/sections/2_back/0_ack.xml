 <p>We would like to thank the private landowners in California and Colorado for allowing bird trapping on their respective properties. Brian Carroll at the University of California, Davis Arbovirus Field Station in Bakersfield, California provided assistance in capturing and housing House sparrows and House finches in California. We would also like to thank Dr. Amanda Calvert for critical review of the manuscript.</p>
