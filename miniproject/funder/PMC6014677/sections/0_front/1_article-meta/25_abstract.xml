 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has become a major concern due to its association with congenital birth defects and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. We enrolled 33 laboratory-confirmed Zika cases (index cases) and their household members (109 contacts) in Managua, Nicaragua, and followed them for three weeks, collecting serum/plasma, urine and saliva specimens along with clinical, demographic, and socio-economic status information. We found that 61% of the index households had contacts with ZIKV infection, with an average of 1.9 (range 1–6) positive contacts per household, and in 60% of these households, ≥50% of the members were ZIKV-positive. Analysis of clinical information allowed estimating the symptomatic to asymptomatic (S:A) ratio of 14:23 (1:1.6) among the contacts. Finding 62% of the infections to be asymptomatic emphasizes the importance of silent transmission. Evaluating the maximum number of days during which ZIKV RNA was detectable showed that ZIKV was found up to 7 days post-symptom onset in serum/plasma and saliva and 22 days post-symptom onset in urine. Finding ZIKV RNA in saliva over a similar time period and concentration as serum/plasma indicates that saliva could potentially serve as a more accessible diagnostic sample. Overall, these data increase our understanding of ZIKV transmission and help inform public health interventions in the region and globally.</p>
