<p>- The analysis suggests that most susceptibles become infected and then immune soon after the first wave of the epidemic in 2015. The second wave in 2016 has a much lower attack rate with a higher proportion of infants. However, there is potential for a new outbreak some years in the future (the exact time is difficult to determine because the x-axes in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are incorrectly labelled I think). It would be useful to show the age distribution and predicted microcephaly incidence related to the later outbreaks. If these occur mainly in young children born after 2015 then the public health relevance may be minimal. This has wider implications – does it imply that the long-term public health impact of Zika is minimal once the virus has been established as an endemic childhood infection? These are obviously very large claims that are probably unsustainable from the model in its current state, but without further clarity about results they are obvious extrapolations that readers may make.
