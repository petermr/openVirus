 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) caused a major outbreak in the Americas between 2015–2017. It remains unclear if immunity after infection offers life-long protection at an individual level and how long herd immunity can protect a population against a new ZIKV outbreak. Data from Managua, Nicaragua showed an imbalance in protective immunity after ZIKV infection across different age-strata. We used this data to parameterize an individual based mathematical model to predict the future risk of a new ZIKV outbreak and to evaluate the effect of loss of immunity and the introduction of vaccination. We found that the 15–29 age range will be at highest risk of infection during the next ZIKV outbreak, increasing the expected number of congenital abnormalities. We show that vaccination could curb the risk of infection and could extend the herd immunity, but introduction within the next decade is crucial to provide the most benefit.</p>
