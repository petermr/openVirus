It is therefore important to develop accurate methods for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences. Since data from multiple sources (such as dengue and ILI case counts, electronic health records and frequency of multiple internet search terms from Google Trends) can improve forecasts, standard time series analysis methods are inadequate to estimate all the parameter values from the limited amount of data available if we use multiple sources. In this paper, we use a computationally efficient implementation of the known variable selection method that we call the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio (ARLR) method. This method combines sparse representation of time series data, electronic health records data (for ILI) and Google Trends data to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. This sparse representation method uses an algorithm that maximizes an appropriate likelihood ratio at every step. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method recovers the underlying sparse model much more accurately than the lasso method. We apply our method to dengue case count data from five countries/states: Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand and to ILI case count data from the United States. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing time series forecasting methods in forecasting the dengue and ILI case counts. In particular, our method gives a 18 percent forecast error reduction over a leading method that also uses data from multiple sources. It also performs better than other methods in predicting the peak value of the case count and the peak time.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) are leading causes of viral infection in the world and hence it is important to develop accurate methods for forecasting their incidence.

It is estimated [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] that almost half the world&#x02019;s population spread out over 128 countries is at risk of dengue infection while 400 million people could actually be infected by dengue [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] every year. A large fraction of these cases occur in low income countries. Of these, about 100 million are estimated [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] to exhibit clinical symptoms. In the past decade, dengue cases have also been reported in Europe, China, and the USA [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] thus expanding the regions that could witness dengue outbreaks even further.</p><p>Influenza is another viral disease that affects a significant fraction of the world population. It is estimated that 3 to 5 million people worldwide are afflicted with severe illness due to influenza-like illness (ILI) of whom between 300,000 to 650,000 die [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Deaths occur mainly among people aged 65 years or above in the developed world [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and children below 5 years of age in developing countries [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Given the huge social, economic, and health burden of dengue and ILI, it is important to be able to accurately forecast dengue and ILI incidences. Such forecasts would permit timely and adequate deployment of experienced medical personnel such as physicians and nurses, resources such as mosquito nets and antivirals (especially, flu vaccines in the case of Influenza A and B), and timely application of emergency vector control measures in the affected regions/countries. Such measures can reduce mortality rates in the case of severe dengue from more than 20% to less than 1% [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the case of influenza, a recent study [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] estimated that vaccinated adults were up to 80% less likely to die than unvaccinated flu-hospitalized patients.</p><p>Several methods have been proposed to forecast dengue incidence. Some of these methods were developed in the context of the Dengue Forecasting Project [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. One class of methods uses deterministic differential equations and primarily focuses on dengue transmission [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Such methods are reviewed in [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another class of models follows a data-driven approach and uses techniques such as machine learning [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Other examples in this class include seasonal autoregressive models that incorporate weather information [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and hybrid models [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Another line of approach uses Internet searches, social media activity and phone data to forecast dengue and ILI incidences [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Other recent approaches for forecasting disease outbreaks use a variety of methods such as data-driven agent-based models [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], ensemble methods [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], phenomenological models [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], support vector machines [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], superensemble methods [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], neural networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], spatio-temporal methods [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and delta densities [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A comparison of several of these methods can be found in [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A recent leading method for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences is AutoRegression with General Online data (ARGO) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] that combines autoregressive processes with Google Trends and other online data.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Summary of contributions and significance</title><p>In this paper, we focus on a time series modelling approach to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. The standard time series methods for fitting models such as autoregressive models yield dense models. In other words, most of the regressor coefficients (model parameters) are non-zero. However, in the context of forecasting dengue and ILI incidences, it is important to have sparse models representing the data. There are several reasons for this. Using only the past incidence data to forecast future values may not be adequate since the forecast accuracies may not be high [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It should be added that this need not always be the case [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In general, one hopes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] to improve forecast accuracies by including additional sources of data such as frequencies of search terms from Google Trends data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.google.com/trends">www.google.com/trends</ext-link>) and electronic health records. Each such additional source of data leads to additional parameters that need to be estimated from the data. However, the amount of data available is typically insufficient to robustly estimate the required parameter values. Hence we need to represent this data using sparse models. A standard method for obtaining sparse models is the lasso method [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The lasso method has been implemented in the ARGO method [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences. We implement a computationally efficient method for variable selection, in order to obtain sparse representations of the data, that outperforms the lasso method. This is demonstrated by fitting autoregressive models using both the lasso method and our method to synthetic time series data generated from sparse models. We find that our method recovers the underlying sparse model with much greater accuracy than the lasso method.</p><p>We apply the method for fitting a sparse vector autoregressive model to dengue and ILI case counts time series data. Further, we adopt a comprehensive method to remove the seasonal component before applying the regression model. For both dengue and ILI, we use exactly the same data as was used for investigating the ARGO method [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This data has been made publicly available by authors of the ARGO method and this facilitates direct comparison of our method with the ARGO and other methods.</p><p>For dengue, we analyze monthly aggregated dengue case count data from five countries/states: 3 in Asia (Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand) and 2 in South America (Brazil and Mexico). This is combined with the top ten queries that were most highly correlated with the term &#x02018;dengue&#x02019; in each country [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] using Google Trends data. For each country, the monthly aggregated search fractions of these terms [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] were then used. In the case of ILI, we used weekly ILI case count data from the United States. This is combined with electronic health records and Google Trends data [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The combination of the sparse representation technique and multiple data sources that we use yields a forecasting method that outperforms other competing methods in terms of forecast error measures. More specifically, our method achieves an average of 18% reduction in the forecast error over the ARGO method which is a leading method that also uses data from multiple sources. Our method is general and could also be used to forecast other disease outbreaks.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We describe different methods that can be used to forecast dengue and ILI incidences.

Standard methods for estimating coefficients for the above VAR model use either linear regression or the Yule-Walker equations [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The models obtained using such methods are dense in the sense that the coefficient matrices <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> are all dense wherein most (if not all) of the matrix entries are non-zero. In the context of forecasting dengue or ILI incidence, using such time series models becomes problematic since this large number of parameters need to be estimated from a limited amount of data leading to noisy or inaccurate estimates. This problem is further compounded if we also incorporate Google Trends or electronic health records data into the modeling process, further increasing the number of parameters to be estimated. A standard way of overcoming this problem is to use sparse models [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we use an alternative sparse modelling method, a variable selection method, that is already known [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Variable selection method, however, is computationally inefficient. We have devised a computationally efficient process for variable selection. Variable selection is based on comparing the relative likelihoods of candidate solutions [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Instead of including, at one go, all variables at all possible lags as predictors for each of the response variables, each variable at each individual lag is included (removed) as a predictor, one at a time, based on the size of the observed error in the response variable(s) before and after the inclusion (removal). A detailed description of the method is given in the Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>). To briefly summarize, starting from a suitable initial VAR model (typically the trivial model), lagged predictor variables are added or removed depending on whether their inclusion (exclusion) significantly increases (decreases) the likelihood that the data is explained by the model, respectively. This process is continued until no further variables can be added or removed.</p><p>As mentioned above, we have implemented the variable selection method in a computationally efficient manner described in the Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>). We call this the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio (ARLR) method. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated using time complexity calculations in the Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>). We also use an alternative stopping criterion given by the <italic>AICC</italic> (corrected AIC) criterion [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Both these factors enable this method to effectively handle thousands of variables. The computationally efficient method is general and is applicable beyond disease forecasting.</p><p>We now describe the preprocessing steps required in order to make the dengue/influenza data amenable to analysis by our method. We model the time series data for each country/state as given below following a systematic approach. Given the original data <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> (dengue or ILI case count), we first separate out the deterministic and stochastic components (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, respectively). In order to accomplish this, we determine whether the model to be used is additive (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> + <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) or multiplicative (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub><italic>U</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) by computing the mean and standard deviation in a fixed-length window that slides over the data. If the underlying model is additive, the mean remains approximately constant across the windows whereas if the underlying model is multiplicative, it is the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation that remains approximately constant. We find the latter to be the case and hence we choose a multiplicative model. In the case of Taiwan, we find that it is log(<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>), rather than <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, which follows the multiplicative model. Consequently, in the case of Taiwan, we take log(<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) to be the original data so that the subsequent analysis is identical for all cases.</p><p>The multiplicative model can be transformed to a new additive model by taking a logarithm: log(<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) = log(<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) + log(<italic>U</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>). Letting <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = log(<italic>U</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>), <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> = log(<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) and <inline-formula id="pcbi.1007518.e005"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007518.e005.jpg" id="pcbi.1007518.e005g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02032;</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>log</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, we finally get

Thus we need to additively decompose the transformed data into the deterministic component <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> (which is essentially comprised of a trend and a seasonal component) and the stationary component <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. To do this, we first determine the seasonality (<italic>s</italic>) of the process as follows. We compute a smoothed power spectrum of the original forecast variable. The spectrum is smoothed by appending zeros to the case count up to a length of 1024. We obtain the location of the dominant peak. The corresponding period <italic>s</italic> (in either months or weeks) is taken to be the seasonality (s). Now the deterministic component is found by fitting the following simple model to the data:

This model also accounts for a mean and second-order seasonality, if present in the data. We refer to this step as the <italic>prefitting</italic> step. For this prefitting step, we use the same algorithm as described in the Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The residuals from this prefitting step comprise the stationary component <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. This stationary component is what is used the subsequent analysis.</p><p>Let <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> be obtained as above after prefitting. Here, <italic>t</italic> represents time in months for dengue and time in weeks for ILI. Let <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>,<italic>g</italic></sub> be the log-transformed Google search frequency for the search term <italic>g</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>. These can be considered as exogenous terms [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. There can be additional exogenous terms like the electronic health records in the case of ILI.

Each of these models produces a monthly (weekly) forecast for the dengue (ILI) case count using data from two years preceding that month (week) as the training set. We now need to weight the forecasts of each model so that we favor the better-performing models [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Performance is decided as follows. Suppose we are forecasting the dengue (ILI) case count for month (week) <italic>r</italic> in year <italic>v</italic>. For each of the models, we first forecast dengue (ILI) case counts for the same month (week) <italic>r</italic> but in the preceding 2 years (<italic>v</italic> &#x02212; 1 and <italic>v</italic> &#x02212; 2). We calculate the mean forecast error <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for the <italic>i</italic>th model using these two forecasts and the corresponding observations. The model with the largest mean forecast error <italic>e</italic>* is considered to be the worst performing model.

Obviously, the best performing model (that is, the one with the smallest error) will have the highest weight. The worst performing model will have weight 1. These weights, after rounding, can be considered as votes. The <italic>i</italic>th method casts <italic>round</italic>(<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) votes for its forecast. We use the median value of all the votes cast as the consensus forecast of the ensemble [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

The allowed autoregressive lags used used for ARLR were months 1 to 4 and month 12.</p><p>We use a 4-year training window for our method since deseasoning is carried out by directly analyzing the time series data and a longer time window leads to a better estimate of the seasonality component that is to be removed. In ARGO and Glmnet lasso, seasonality is captured by using appropriate lags in the AR model.

This is based on the hypothesis that the previous 12 months, i.e. short term influences, as well as the long term seasonal influence at 24 months which has been reported to be important for dengue prediction, are required for accurate estimation of dengue case counts. Since the lags are fixed, increasing the training window to 4 years to match with that used by ARLR method is not expected to lead to any significant changes in the results. We have verified this for the Glmnet lasso method that is a slight variant of the ARGO method. For ARGO method we have reproduced the results reported in the paper [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which uses a 2-year training window.

It should be noted that we do not predict the peak values and peak times at the start of the season but obtain them in a post-facto manner after we have the forecast values for the entire season.

This includes: planning to handle surge in hospital admissions (health care workers, protective equipment, ventilators, etc.), planning and producing pharmaceuticals, including vaccines and antivirals, taking precautionary measures such closing schools and community activities. For instance, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, forecasting was used for taking certain actions that included school closures in NYC. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, forecasts played an important role in galvanizing an international response to the outbreak. See [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] for more information and discussion on this topic.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Dengue forecasts</title><p>From the figures, it is clear that ARLR method does a good job of forecasting the dengue and ILI incidences. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007518.g003">Fig 3</xref> we observe, as expected, that the forecast error increases as the forecast horizon increases. A quantitative measure of its performance is seen from the Tables. It is clearly seen that ARLR outperforms the other methods for both dengue and ILI and for all countries/states except for one (realtime dengue incidence forecast errors for Brazil). In this context it should be pointed that ARGO method (which performs better than ours in the case of Brazil) tunes the structure of the regularization parameters to optimize the results for each country/state (see the supplementary information in [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). Our method does not require such tuning. The Glmnet lasso method is essentially identical to ARGO except that no such tuning is done. Our method does perform better than Glmnet lasso even for Brazil. Further, in all cases, ARLR forecast error is always better than the forecast error for the baseline naive method whereas this is not true for the other methods. Compared to ARGO (the next best performing method), our method (ARLR) achieves a 26% average reduction in RMSE for realtime forecast when averaged across all countries/states; a 21% reduction in MAE; and a 6% reduction in MAPE. The overall average reduction across all error measures for realtime forecast is 18% compared to the ARGO method. It should be noted that even if we use a log transformation of dengue case counts for Taiwan (as for the other countries), our method still outperforms ARGO method, but to a lesser extent. Similarly, for predicting peak value, our method achieves a 43% reduction in errors over the Glmnet lasso method when averaged across all countries/states. Predictions of peak times are also a bit better.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>ILI forecasts</title><p>For realtime (one-week ahead) ILI forecasts, ARLR method achieves a 17% reduction in RMSE, a 15% reduction in MAE, and a 3.5% reduction in MAPE as compared to ARGO. For two-week, three-week and four-week ahead ILI incidence forecasts, our method (ARLR) achieves a 19% average reduction in RMSE compared to ARGO. The substantial improvements seen using our method result from an efficient sparse representation of the time series using the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio method and proper deseasoning of the raw time series.</p><p>RMSE of the real-time forecast for several countries for shorter window lengths of 2 and 3 years were compared with RMSE of the forecast for a window length of 4 years (that has been used in this paper). For shorter windows, the RMSE can be up to 25% higher than the RMSE for a 4-year window.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Effect of backfill on forecast skill</title><p>Using ILI incidence data, the forecast skill for the nowcast averaged across all forecast windows is found to be 0.98 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007518.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The best possible forecast skill is 1. If we use the historical ILI incidence data without backfill, we get a forecast skill of 0.95. We see that forecast skill when using backfill data can be substantially better than forecast skill obtained using realtime data (without correcting for backfill). Similar improvements are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007518.g004">Fig 4</xref> for two-week, three-week, and four-week ahead forecasts. Such improvements are to be expected [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>We emphasize that, even after accounting for backfill, our forecast skill values cannot be directly compared with the values obtained in the realtime CDC flu prediction challenge [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] for the following reasons:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We use unweighted ILI incidence in order to facilitate comparison with ARGO results.

Note that weighted ILI incidences are not simple scaled versions of the unweighted ILI incidences. In fact, weighted ILI incidence and unweighted ILI incidence can often exhibit different trends. Therefore, weighted and unweighted ILI incidences are two different forecasting targets and the corresponding forecasting errors can also be different. If we use the historical weighted ILI incidence data, we get a forecast skill of 0.90 for nowcast. This value is similar to the value reported in [<xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] using Dynamic Bayesian forecasting method on national data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We predict the ILI incidence at a national scale whereas the CDC flu prediction challenge also involves prediction at a regional scale.

One reason for this is the additional data source (electronic health records) that was available for forecasting ILI incidence. Across geographies, there is again variation in the errors in forecasting dengue. There could be several reasons for this such as poorer quality of the dengue incidence data collection and less widespread usage of internet.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Comparison of different modeling approaches</title><p>Our model differs from the ARGO model in two significant ways. The ARLR method estimates the parameters using the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio algorithm. In ARGO, the lasso method is used to estimate the parameters. The improved performance of ARLR method in forecasting dengue and ILI incidences can therefore be explained based on the comparison in the Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>) between the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio and lasso algorithms. In our model, the removal of the seasonal effect is carried out through a systematic process. In ARGO, this is achieved in an ad-hoc manner by incorporating lags at months 12 and 24 in the autoregressive model. Further, in ARGO, the regularization parameter is estimated using a cross-validation process. Since this is a random process, the values of the regularization parameter obtained each time are different. Hence the forecast values and the forecast error measures can differ from run to run. This drawback is absent in our method.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are limitations to our method as listed below.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Google Trend queries would be related to disease incidence in countries where a substantial proportion of the population uses internet.

Using monthly dengue case counts and Google search term frequency data from 5 countries/states, and weekly ILI case counts, Google search term frequency data and electronic health records from USA we fitted a sparse autoregressive model (with exogenous terms) to these data using the ARLR method and obtained forecasts for dengue and ILI case counts. It was shown that the forecast error measures are, on the average, substantially lower for our method when compared to existing methods like ARGO, Glmnet lasso, Kalman filter, and ensemble method.</p><p>Our method would be most useful in cases where we need to forecast using data from multiple sources, the effect of each of which is modelled using one or more unknown parameters. In such cases, the training window immediately preceding the forecast time point has to be necessarily short since data from beyond a certain short time in the past does not contribute to the predictive ability. In summary, a large number of parameters need to be estimated using a short training window with a limited number of data points. In such cases, sparse models like ARLR become essential to obtain robust parameter estimates which then lead to more accurate forecasts. Our method could also be used to forecast incidence of other diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec035"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007518.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio algorithm.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1007518.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007518.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Additional figures.
