 <p>Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses are emerging Aedes-borne viruses that are spreading outside their known geographic range and causing wide-scale epidemics. It has been shown that these viruses can be transmitted efficiently by Aedes aegypti. Recent studies have shown that Ae. aegypti when transinfected with certain Wolbachia strains shows a reduced replication and dissemination of several arboviruses, including dengue and yellow fever viruses. This study examines the effect of the wMel strain of Wolbachia in Singapore’s Ae. aegypti on susceptibility of these mosquitoes to ZIKV and CHIKV and finds that there is very strong inhibition of replication and dissemination of both viruses in mosquitoes that contain Wolbachia. Results from this study strongly suggest that female Ae. aegypti carrying Wolbachia will have a reduced capacity to transmit ZIKV and CHIKV. This indicates that establishment of Wolbachia in Ae. aegypti populations should reduce transmission of these viruses and presents a potential control measure in this setting.</p>
