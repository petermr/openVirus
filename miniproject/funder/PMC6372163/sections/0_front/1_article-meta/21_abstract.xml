 <p>Arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses are notorious for causing unpredictable and large-scale epidemics and epizootics. Apart from viruses such as West Nile virus and Rift Valley fever virus that are well-known to cause a significant impact on human and animal health, many arboviruses remain neglected. Shuni virus (SHUV) is a neglected virus with zoonotic characteristics that was recently associated with severe disease in livestock and wildlife. Isolations from field-collected biting midges and mosquitoes suggests that SHUV may be transmitted by these insects. In this study, four main vectors that transmit other arboviruses were selected to test their susceptibility to SHUV. Laboratory-reared biting midge species (
  <italic>Culicoides nubeculosus</italic> and 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>sonorensis</italic>) and mosquito species (
  <italic>Culex pipiens pipiens</italic> and 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) were exposed to SHUV via an infectious blood meal. SHUV was able to successfully disseminate in both biting midge species, whereas no evidence of transmission by both mosquito species was found. Our results suggest that SHUV can be transmitted efficiently by diverse 
  <italic>Culicoides</italic> species, and thereby that these insects could play a major role in the disease transmission cycle.
