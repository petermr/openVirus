 <p>Characterization of the spatiotemporal distribution of dengue transmission intensity, a key measure of population infection risk, can inform the optimal use and deployment of control and prevention programmes. Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is a large urban centre with hyperendemic dengue transmission. We fitted catalytic models to age-stratified dengue surveillance data reported in Jakarta’s subdistricts from 2008 to 2017. We estimated a long-term average annual transmission intensity of 0.130 (95%CrI: 0.129–0.131) per year in Jakarta province, which varied across subdistricts from 0.090 (95%CrI: 0.077–0.103) per year in Sawah Besar to 0.164 (95%CrI: 0.153–0.174) per year in Pasar Rebo. We observed significant spatiotemporal variation and clustering of transmission intensity in Jakarta. Our estimates obtained from the analysis of yearly and cumulative case-notification data reported between 2008 and 2017 represent the first detailed estimates of average dengue transmission intensity, which will be key to assess the potential impact of future control and prevention programmes in Jakarta province.</p>
