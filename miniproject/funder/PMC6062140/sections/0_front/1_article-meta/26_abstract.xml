 <p>Febrile illnesses have many origins, but infectious agents are the most important cause. Pathogens such as viruses and bacteria can cause various diseases, but associated signs and symptoms are generally non-specific and can overlap between diseases. Treatments of infectious diseases rely on the diagnostic of the causative agent however laboratory capacities are often lacking in resources-limited settings. Thus, health care workers generally follow clinical management guidelines that are rarely supported by information on the prevalence of local infections. The main objective of our study was to describe the common causes of fever in individuals presenting at outpatient healthcare center in Madagascar. Respiratory viruses, malaria and viral infection in the blood were the main infectious agents detected. Implementation of new diagnostic tools such as bedside testing (Point of Care Testing) could help health care workers to improve diagnosis and care of febrile patients. Detection of other pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or agent responsible for tuberculosis enhances the need for extended prevention, surveillance and detection of these infections. Interestingly, our study reported cases of leptospirosis and Rift Valley Fever virus infection that are pathogens of high public health concern.</p>
