 <p>The first importation of infections into China in 2016 and the following outbreaks in Africa and Brazil of yellow fever virus (YFV) have raised again the concerns of the potential viral spread into new territories. In this study, we aimed to know the evolution dynamics of YFV by using intrahost phylogenomics and to assess the risk of virus epidemics. Through deep sequencing of consecutive samples from 12 patients, we identified hundreds of genomic variations (iSNVs and SNPs), and noticed the nearly linear accumulation of variations within individuals. The estimated evolutionary rate within host is much higher than the epidemic evolutionary rate. In comparison with Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), which share similar host vectors (Aedes spp.), life cycles, mutation rates and replication strategies to YFV, the lower epidemic evolutionary rate of YFV might have been hindered by the shorter viremia duration, which decreased the accumulated variations to get into the transmission cycle.</p>
