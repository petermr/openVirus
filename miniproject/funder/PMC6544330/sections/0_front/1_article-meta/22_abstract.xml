 <p>Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a global infectious disease, which is still a serious public health threat in China today. The reported HFRS cases in Shandong Province accounted for approximate one third of total cases in the whole country. HFRS is a zoonosis mainly caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), which natural rodent hosts are

  <italic>norvegicus</italic>, respectively. To explore the current HFRS epidemic foci based on patients, rodents and molecular epidemiology characteristics in Shandong Province, we collected the records of HFRS cases from whole province and the rodents captured in 14 surveillance sites. We found that the epidemic situation of HFRS is quiet different in temporal and spatial distribution. Three epidemic foci were defined based on patients, rodents and molecular epidemiology characteristics. The situation of HFRS epidemic foci in Shandong Province was clear. Our study provides a reference for relevant departments to develop key prevention strategies.
