 <p>Usutu virus (USUV) is an African mosquito-borne virus closely related to West Nile virus and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus serogroup in the 
  <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus. Recently several neurological disorders such as encephalitis, meningitis and meningoencephalitis were associated with USUV-infection in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. The goal of our work was to study the ability of USUV to infect neuronal cells and to characterize the effects of USUV infection in these cells. We have shown that USUV can infect efficiently several neuronal cells (mature neurons, astrocytes, microglia, IPSc-derived human neuronal stem cells (NSCs)). Interestingly, USUV replicates in human astrocytes more efficiently than another mosquito-borne flavivirus, Zika virus, reduces cell proliferation and induces strong anti-viral response. Moreover, USUV induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in NSCs. Our results suggest that USUV infection may lead to encephalitis and/or meningoencephalitis via neuronal toxicity and inflammatory response.
