 <p>The Oropouche, Mayaro, Saint Louis, and Rocio viruses are neglected emerging mosquito-borne viruses that are spreading and causing wide-scale epidemics in South America. However, under-reporting of these cases is possible, as the symptoms are shared with other endemic diseases. Moreover, little is known regarding environmental conditions that favor these tropical outbreaks of arboviral diseases. This study examined the association of environmental factors with the probability of occurrence of Oropouche, Mayaro, Saint Louis and Rocio fever outbreaks (present and future) and finds that temperature is a central variable that determines the distribution of high-risk areas. This fact is very worrying, because the average temperature of some areas has increased significantly over the time. Results from this study strongly suggest that these four diseases have the potential to become important public health problems or become increasingly relevant in Brazil and other tropical areas in the coming years and should be monitored as part of effective control programs.</p>
