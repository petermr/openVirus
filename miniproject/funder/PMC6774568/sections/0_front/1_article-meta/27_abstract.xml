  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) are often co-endemic. The high protein-sequence homology of 
   <italic>flaviviruses</italic> renders IgG induced by and directed against them highly cross-reactive against their antigen(s), as observed on a large set of sera, leading to poorly reliable sero-diagnosis.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>We selected Domain III of the ZIKV Envelope (ZEDIII) sequence, which is virus specific. This recombinant domain was expressed and purified for the specific detection of ZEDIII-induced IgG by ELISA from ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive, ZIKV-IgM-positive, 
   <italic>flavivirus</italic>-positive but ZIKV-negative, or 
   <italic>flavivirus</italic>-negative sera. We also assessed the reactivity of ZEDIII-specific human antibodies against EDIII of DENV serotype 4 (D4EDIII) as a specific control. Sera from ZEDIII-immunized mice were also tested.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Cross-reactivity of IgG from 5,600 sera against total inactivated DENV or ZIKV was high (71.0% [69.1; 72.2]), whereas the specificity and sensitivity calculated using a representative cohort (242 sera) reached 90% [84.0; 95.8] and 92% [84.5; 99.5], respectively, using a ZEDIII-based ELISA. Moreover, purified human IgG against D2EDIII or D4EDIII did not bind to ZEDIII and we observed no D4EDIII reactivity with ZIKV-induced mouse polyclonal IgGs.</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>We developed a ZEDIII-based ELISA that can discriminate between past or current DENV and ZIKV infections, allowing the detection of a serological scar from other 
   <italic>flaviviruses</italic>. This could be used to confirm exposure of pregnant women or to follow the spread of an endemic disease.
