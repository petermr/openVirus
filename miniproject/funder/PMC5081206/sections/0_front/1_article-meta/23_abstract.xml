 <p>Phleboviruses transmitted by sandflies are endemic in the Mediterranean basin. An increased number of new viruses was described during the last decade. However, levels of exposure of human and animal populations are poorly known. A total of 1,250 dogs from Greece and 422 dogs from Cyprus were tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies signing previous infection with selected phleboviruses representing the 3 serological complexes known to be present in the Old World: Toscana virus (TOSV), Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) and Salehabad viruses (Arbia and Adana viruses). Our data showed that (i) SFSV is largely predominant with infection rates higher than 50%, (ii) TOSV is widely distributed with 4.4% and 8.4% in Greece and Cyprus, respectively, and (iii) that viruses belonging to the Salehabad serocomplex should be further studied for their capacity to cause human disease in view of prevalence rates in dogs up to 22.6%. These findings confirm that dogs can be considered as excellent sentinels for sandfly-borne phleboviruses. The results also underline the importance to study the role of SFSV in humans and may lead to the set-up diagnostic tests for patients presenting unexplained febrile illness and neuroinvasive infections. Further studies are also needed to define whether these viruses cause diseases in dogs.</p>
