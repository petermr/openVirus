 <p>Dengue has led to heavy disease burden in China. The reported incidence of the disease increased dramatically in recent years and cases have expanded from southern to central and northern part of China. In this study, the findings include that DENV-1 can transmit rapidly with a short period of time and leads to high attack rate in community, and that rHBR or AVC should be recommended as primary interventions to control rapid transmission of dengue virus at the early stage of an outbreak. Therefore, dengue outbreak is at high risk in many areas in China because of the potential high receptivity (widely distribution of

  <italic>albopictus</italic>) and vulnerability (high frequency of the importation) of the transmission. The high transmissibility of the virus makes it hard and urgent to control the outbreak. Delayed intervention (larvae control or case isolation) is hard to show its effectiveness and the interventions without delay are strongly recommended. Bed net or mosquito repellents were encouraged to use in the community to reduce HBR, and space spraying of insecticides were recommended to control adult vector during the outbreak.
