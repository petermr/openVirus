We hypothesized that phospholipid scramblase-1 (PLSCR1), a calcium responsive enzyme that flips phosphatidylserines between membrane leaflets, might redistribute Akt to the outside during entry. Confocal imaging, biotinylation of membrane proteins and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that HSV activates PLSCR1 and flips phosphatidylserines and Akt to the outside shortly following HSV-1 or HSV-2 exposure. Translocation was blocked by addition of a cell permeable calcium chelator, pharmacological scramblase antagonist, or transfection with small interfering RNA targeting PLSCR1. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation studies demonstrated that PLSCR1 associated with glycoprotein L at the outer leaflet and studies with gL deletion viruses indicate that this interaction facilitates subsequent restoration of the plasma membrane architecture. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, also induced PLSCR1 activation resulting in Akt externalization, suggesting a previously unrecognized biological phenomenon.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Defining the mechanisms by which herpes simplex viruses (HSV) enter cells will facilitate the development of new strategies to prevent or treat infections and provide insights into cell biology.

HSV-2 is the leading cause of genital ulcerative disease worldwide, whereas HSV-1 has emerged as the more common cause of genital infection in industrialized nations [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Perinatal transmission of either serotype can result in severe infant morbidity or death. Moreover, HSV-1 is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis and even with optimal intravenous acyclovir therapy, mortality is 14&#x02013;19% and fewer than 50% of the survivors resume a normal lifestyle [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These epidemiological findings highlight the need to better define the mechanisms by which HSV invades cells to establish life-long persistent infection and to exploit this knowledge to develop new antiviral strategies.</p><p>HSV entry is initiated by attachment of HSV-1 glycoprotein (g) C (gC-1) or HSV-2 gB (gB-2) to heparan sulfate moieties on syndecan proteoglycans [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], followed by engagement of one of several gD receptors, most commonly nectin-1 on epithelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This activates a complex signaling cascade that requires interactions between cellular molecules and viral glycoproteins gB, gH and gL and culminates in the insertion of the gB fusion loops into the plasma membrane (or less commonly, endosomal membrane), with formation of a fusion pore through which the viral capsid and tegument proteins are delivered [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Precisely how these viral glycoproteins interact with cellular components to promote viral entry is not fully defined. In previous work, we found that chelation or pharmacological blockade of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release prevented HSV entry in multiple cell types [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was detected near the plasma membrane in response to heparan sulfate binding and nectin engagement by Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorimetry and confocal microscopy. This initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response facilitated subsequent activation of Akt and downstream signaling pathways culminating in the release of inositol-triphosphate receptor (IP3R)-regulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores that promote viral entry [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation studies demonstrated that Akt associated with gB, which was surprising as Akt is presumed to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, whereas viral envelope glycoproteins are retained at the outer surface. We subsequently showed that HSV triggered the externalization of Akt, providing access to the viral envelope. Akt was detected by fluorescently conjugated antibodies (Abs) in non-permeabilized cells shortly after exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2 by confocal imaging, but was only visualized after permeabilization in mock-infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>There are several transmembrane lipid transporter enzymes that translocate phospholipids between the inner (dominated by negatively charged phosphatidylserines (PtdS) and outer (dominated by phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) lipid bilayer of cell membranes. These include phospholipid flippases and floppases, which are ATP-dependent unidirectional enzymes that move lipids from the outer to the cytosolic face or in the reverse direction, respectively, and phospholipid scramblases (PLSCRs), which are Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive small transmembrane proteins that act bidirectionally. There are several splice variants of PLSCR, but PLSCR1 is the prototype and the most studied member of the family [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. More recently, two additional scramblase proteins, TMEM16F, which is regulated by elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and XKR8, a caspase-sensitive protein required for PtdS exposure in apoptotic cells, have been identified [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Mutations in TMEM16F are associated with Scott syndrome, a platelet disorder in which Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced PtdS exposure is impaired [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that the initial intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to HSV receptor engagement activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive scramblases to trigger the translocation of PtdS from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane resulting also in the externalization of Akt. However, because PtdS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is associated with activation of apoptotic pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we further hypothesized that HSV would flip PtdS and Akt back to restore the plasma membrane architecture. Focusing on PLSCR1, we used a combination of confocal imaging, molecular and biochemical techniques and wild type or deletion viruses to test these hypotheses in human cervical or vaginal epithelial cells and keratinocytes. To address whether the response is limited to HSV or a more generalized phenomenon, we also examined the response to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, ionomycin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>HSV redistributes phosphatidylserines to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane</title><p>To test the hypothesis that PtdS translocate from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in response to HSV, human cervical epithelial cells (CaSki) or keratinocytes (HaCAT) were infected with HSV-1(KOS) or HSV-2(G) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 or 1 pfu/cell at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h, unbound virus removed by washing the cells and then shifted to 37&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes, washed with a pH 3.5 buffer to inactivate any non-penetrated virus, fixed with or without Triton X and stained with annexin V, which binds PtdS (red) or, as a control, with an antibody (Ab) to the ATP-dependent flippase, aminophospholipid transporter class 1 (FIC-1) (green).

This results in flipping of phosphatidylserines (PtdS) from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which results in externalization of Akt and possibly other inner plasma membrane- associated proteins (Step 5). Akt interacts with gB, which may promote a conformational change in Akt that facilitates its phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 by yet to be determined kinases (Step 6). Integrin&#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 binds to gH (Step 7), and activated Akt and integrin transfer signals to the cell cytoplasm that lead to the generation of inositol triphosphates and release of inositol-triphosphate receptor (IP3R)-regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (Step 8) culminating in fusion of the viral envelope and plasma membrane and entry of viral capsids (Step 9). PtdS flip back to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to restore normal membrane asymmetry in a process that may occur in response to viral entry and may be regulated by gL binding to PLSCR1 and subsequent shift to primarily dephosphorylated PLSCR1. (Step 10).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1006766.g010"/></fig><p>In response to viral gC (HSV-1) and/or gB (HSV-2) binding to heparan sulfate and engagement of the primary co-receptor, nectin-1, by gD (both serotypes), a small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released intracellularly, which is sufficient to activate PLSCR1. PLSCR1 flips PtdS from the inner to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which results in externalization of Akt and possibly other inner leaflet proteins. Glycoprotein B binds to externalized Akt, which may promote a conformational change to expose Akt phosphorylation sites, similar to what happens when Akt interacts with 3&#x02019;-phosphoinositides at the inner plasma membrane [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Akt becomes phosphorylated by yet to be determined kinases at serine 473 and threonine 308 and activated Akt may act as a catalytic kinase, possibly via outside-in signaling, although the downstream targets of Akt&#x02019;s kinase activity require future study. Interference with PLSCR1 (chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, siRNA, or R5421) or Akt (siRNA, miltefosine [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and other Akt kinase inhibitors) prevents downstream signaling events associated with viral entry including interactions between integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and gH, generation of inositol triphosphates and release of IP3R-dependent intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Externalization of Akt had not been previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but may be a generalized response to PLSCR1 activation, as phosphorylated Akt was also detected on the outside when cells were treated with ionomycin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore. Prolonged PtdS exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is an apoptotic signal [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. HSV prevents this by flipping PtdS back within 2&#x02013;4 h following viral exposure in a process that is dependent on PLSCR1 and gL. PtdS persist on the outside if R5421 is added to the cultures 30-minutes post-infection or if the cells are infected with HSV variants deleted in gL. The major role of gL in HSV entry has been presumed to be that of a chaperone protein, enabling gH to be transported from the ER to the plasma membrane where it is incorporated into the viral envelope as a gH-gL heterodimer [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However more recent work indicates that gL becomes dissociated from gH during viral entry and may play a regulatory role [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our findings indicate that at least part of this &#x0201c;regulatory&#x0201d; role involves PLSCR1. HSV may initially &#x0201c;lock&#x0201d; PLSCR1 in a conformation that retains PtdS and Akt at the outer leaflet to allow Akt activation but, subsequently, in a process that involves gL, HSV &#x0201c;unlocks&#x0201d; PLSCR1 to allow PtdS to flip back thereby preventing apoptosis. Our studies also suggest that the conformation and activation state of PLSCR1 are linked to its tyrosine phosphorylation. PLSCR1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and readily detected by immunostaining with a mAb that recognizes an N-terminal epitope in non-permeablized cells shortly after exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2. However, 2&#x02013;4 h pi, PLSCR1 becomes inactivated and is detected only in permeabilized cells and primarily in its non-phosphorylated form. In contrast, phosphorylated PLSCR1 persists and remains detectable in non-permeabilized cells following exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2 gL deletion viruses. We speculate that interactions between gL and PLSCR1 may alter the conformation and thus the phosphorylation state of PLSCR1.</p><p>Equine herpesvirus (EHV)-1 also activates PLSCR1, but this was observed downstream of the interactions between gH and integrin &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 and was dependent on the release of IP3R-regulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In contrast, HSV-1 and HSV-2 activate PLSCR1 upstream and independent of the interactions between gH and integrins. Possibly this reflects difference in the cellular response to gD co-receptors. Both EHV and HSV bind to heparan sulfate moieties [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but EHV-1 gD interacts with MHC class 1 molecules [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], whereas HSV gD interacts with nectin-1 on most cell types. HSV binding and gD-nectin interactions trigger the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> near the plasma membrane, a response that is necessary and sufficient to activate PLSCR1. Blockade of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release with the cell-permeable chelator, BAPTA-AM, inhibiting heparan sulfate binding with soluble heparin, or gD-nectin-1 interactions by adding antibodies to gD or nectin to the cultures, prevents PLSCR1 activation.</p><p>Several viruses incorporate PtdS into their envelope and then exploit this to interact with PtdS cellular receptors such as Human T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin-domain containing proteins (TIMs) to promote subsequent entry or egress [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, Ebola virus VP40 interacts with PtdS during viral egress causing the relocalization of PtdS from the inner to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Whether this involves PLSCR1 or other scramblases has not been addressed. The PtdS on the viral envelope subsequently bind TIM-1 or TIM-4 to mediate viral entry into target cells. Similar mechanisms are employed by flaviviruses such as dengue [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, the results of the current studies including the silencing of cellular PLSCR1 suggest that the source of the PtdS is not the HSV envelope but rather flipping of cellular PtdS from the inner to the outer plasma membrane in response to the increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> observed when virus binds to heparan sulfate and engages nectin. The addition of anti-PtdS antibodies during viral entry reduced viral infection suggesting a direct or indirect role for PtdS in this process that warrants future investigation. Possibly, PtdS promote Akt-gB binding analogous to the observation that PtdS promote binding of Akt to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) and subsequent conformational changes needed for Akt phosphorylation and activation [<xref rid="ppat.1006766.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The key role of PLSCR1 and Akt in HSV-1 and HSV-2 entry into several different human cell types and their localization to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane where they interact with HSV glycoproteins L and B, respectively, represents an unprecedented opportunity for targeting these molecules to develop new antivirals. Potentially membrane-impermeable Akt or PLSCR1 inhibitors could be developed that would specifically block HSV entry without adversely impacting normal cellular signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>CaSki [human cervical epithelial cancer cell line; American Type Culture Collection (ATTC) CRL<sub>-</sub>1550, Manassas, VA, USA], VK2/E6E7 [human papilloma virus E6/E7 transformed vaginal epithelial cells ATTC CRL-2616], and Vero [monkey kidney epithelial cell line; ATCC CCL-81] cells were passaged in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); HaCAT cells [human keratinocyte spontaneously immortalized cell line; ATTC CLS 300493] were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
