The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera that belong to the family Coronaviridae. From those, at least 7 coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in humans. Four of these viruses can cause common cold-like symptoms. Those that infect animals can evolve and become infectious to humans. Three recent examples of these viral jumps include SARS CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 virus. They are responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the most recently discovered coronavirus disease during 2019 (COVID-19).</p><p>COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. The rapid spread of the disease has taken the scientific and medical community by surprise. Latest figures from 20 May 2020 show more than 5 million people had been infected with the virus, causing more than 330,000 deaths in over 210 countries worldwide.</p><p>The large amount of information received daily relating to COVID-19 is so abundant and dynamic that medical staff, health authorities, academics and the media are not able to keep up with this new pandemic.</p><p>In order to offer a clear insight of the extensive literature available, we have conducted a comprehensive literature review of the SARS CoV-2 Virus and the Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19).</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2</kwd><kwd>ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome</kwd><kwd>CDCC, The Center for Disease Control in China</kwd><kwd>COVID-19, Coronavirus disease 2019</kwd><kwd>ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</kwd><kwd>GISAID, Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data</kwd><kwd>INF, interferon</kwd><kwd>ISGs, IFN-stimulated genes</kwd><kwd>MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome</kwd><kwd>MHC-I, major histocompatibility complex I</kwd><kwd>ORF, open reading frames</kwd><kwd>PDB, Protein Data Bank archive</kwd><kwd>pDCs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>RCSB, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>RNA, ribonucleic acid</kwd><kwd>RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>RBD, receptor-binding domain</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2</kwd><kwd>SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome</kwd><kwd>TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas</kwd><kwd>TLRs, endosomal toll-like receptors</kwd><kwd>WHO, World Health Organization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="ks0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Review</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p id="p0005">The new COVID-19 disease is caused by a Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) probably originated in Wuhan, China. In mid-December 2019, the Wuhan health authorities detected few cases of an atypical pneumonia that eventually was discovered to be caused by a novel coronavirus. It probably jumped from an animal reservoir to a human during the first week of November 2019(<xref rid="bb1095" ref-type="bibr">Shanker, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0010">Subsequent investigations discovered that the etiological agent was a RNA virus related to the same family of Coronavirus that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and to Respiratory Syndrome of Middle East (MERS) pandemic during 2003 and 2012 respectively (<xref rid="bb0795" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">The specific origin of this new pandemic is not totally understood. At the beginning of the outbreak it was believed that a viral jump occurred between a wild animal and a human being in one of the most populated <italic>wet market</italic> in Wuhan, China during the November 2019. Further investigations were focused around identifying which animals were responsible for these new zoonotic diseases Although it still remains unclear which animal is the intermediary host, it is well-known that bats are the main reservoirs for these types of virus and they probably emerged in one of the local wild-animal farms (<xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">Giri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0785" ref-type="bibr">Lorusso et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s0010"><label>1.1</label><title>Chronology of the pandemic</title><p id="p0020">The Center for Disease Control in China (CDCC) reported that during the last week of December 2019, the first cases of an atypical pneumonia were seen in Wuhan, the capital of Central China's Hubei province. Days later, after the first cases were reported, the Chinese health authorities decided to close the Huanan's &#x0201c;wet market&#x0201d; after some research suggested this place as the probable initial source of contagion (<xref rid="bb1055" ref-type="bibr">Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">During the first week of January, China's authorities announced that the new atypical pneumonia was not caused by either the SARS or the MERS Coronavirus, but a new variant of the Coronaviriade family, a newly discovered virus called SARS-CoV2 (<xref rid="bb1055" ref-type="bibr">Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">On January 11, the first SARS CoV-2 related death was reported and 1 day later, a group of Chinese researchers revealed the genome of the virus implicated in the Wuhan pneumonia outbreak.</p><p id="p0035">From the initial case reported in China, the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread worldwide. At the beginning of the outbreak it started to move through Asia but only days later the first suspicious cases were reported in Europe and North America. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease a worldwide distributed pandemic. Since the first case and using the latest figures from April the 14, 2020, more than 2 million people had been infected with the virus, causing more than 120,000 deaths in over 210 countries worldwide (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>1.2</label><title>Epidemiology trends for COVID-19</title><p id="p0040">Reviewing the data collected from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports, the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) from Johns Hopkins University and the Worldometers databases, the latest figures from 20 May2020 show more than 5,090,118 people had been infected with the virus from over 210 countries, with more than 333,000 deaths worldwide. There have also been roughly 2,546,198 recovered cases.</p><p id="p0045">The epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 has changed dramatically over the course of months. At the beginning of the outbreak, the most affected continent was Asia, with China being the most affected country worldwide, however, nowadays, the Americas, driven mainly by the USA and Brazil, have converted the region in the most affected on the planet (<xref rid="bb1130" ref-type="bibr">Simbana-Rivera et al., 2020</xref>). It is important to emphasize that mortality has an important variability among each of the countries, for instance, South Korea has very low mortality rates, showing a very efficient testing strategy and an excellent response to the emergency, while other countries with less testing capacities, weaker health systems and overall poorer responses to the virus, report higher attack, mortality and case fatality rates (<xref rid="bb0940" ref-type="bibr">Ortiz-Prado et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">The transmission of COVID-19 is by droplets expelled when speaking or sneezing within a 2-meter distance, or by being in contact with exposed surfaces. Fifty percent of transmissions occur secondary to exposure to an asymptomatic people. In-fact one sign of infection of COIVD-19 is a symptom of anosmia (see below) in asymptomatic patients without nasal obstruction. Additionally, patient can transmit the infection up to 2 weeks after having recovered from symptoms of the disease. Transmission through fecal-oral stool is reported to be unlikely. Perinatal transmission has not been detected.</p><p id="p0055">The basic reproduction number (R naught also known as R<sub>0</sub>) is a measure that quantifies the epidemic potential of a pathogen. This number is defined as the average number of persons an infected person can spread the virus. Based on standard epidemics, having R<sub>0</sub> greater than 1 could lead to potential spread of diseases. The basic reproduction rate of SARS-CoV-2 ranges between 2.4 and 3.3, numbers that vary in relationship with mobility, containment measures, susceptibility, population at risk among other parameters. In this sense, each infected person would therefore infect 2 or 3 other people (<xref rid="bb0965" ref-type="bibr">Peiris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bb1470" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0060">The incubation period of COVID-19 typically ranges from 2 to 14 days (98% of patients), with an average of 5 days, although there have been cases with incubations periods of up to 24 days. Typically, the time from infection onset to development of severe disease [including hypoxia] is one week.</p><p id="p0065">COVID-19 generally causes flu-like symptoms, such as fever (80-90%), non-productive cough (50%) and lethargy (20-40%) although in some patients', diarrhea may precede these symptoms.</p><p id="p0070">In specific patient groups, particularly the elderly and those with chronic health conditions, symptoms may progress into pneumonia, with tightness-chest pain and fatigue. After a week, it can lead to difficulty breathing, with approximately 20% of patients requiring hospital treatment. COVID-19 infection rarely seems to cause a runny nose, sneezing, or sore throat [these symptoms have been seen in approximately 5% of patients]. In China, reportedly 80.9% of COVID-19 infections are mild [with flu-like symptoms] and recover at home without hospital intervention. Spain has a much lower figure of home recovery without hospital admission (70%). Recovery from the onset of symptoms in mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and, with severe or critical illness, 3&#x02013;6 weeks.</p><p id="p0075">China had much lower percentages of the population that was tested and developed complex disease (including pneumonia) compared to Spain (13.8% vs. to 23% respectively).</p><p id="p0080">Again, China had fewer critical patients than Spain (4.7% compared to 7% in Spain). Critical complications include respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiorgan damage.</p><p id="p0085">It is important to understand that these figures depend on the percentage of the population screened, if repeat tests were included and the demographics of those tested. In average, the population age in Spain is 13 years older than that in China (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>

Typically, radiographic features include ground glass patterned images, sometimes in patches, without frequently observing interstitial pattern.</p><p id="p0095">Internationally, it is recognized that relatively few cases are seen in children and generally cases are more benign than in adults.</p><p id="p0100">The risk of death increases as you get older. Mortality in the Chinese series of studies is &#x0003c;0.5% in patients younger than 50 years, 2% (50&#x02013;59 years), 4% (60&#x02013;69 years), 8% (70&#x02013;79 years) and 16% (&#x0003e;80 years). The international average mortality is 3%, although there is a difference between countries depending on the average age, the ascending curve, the method used to register COVID-19, and the health services, especially ICU units. In Spain at the time of writing mortality is 67% in patients over 80 years, 20% in those aged between 70 and 79 years and 8% between 60 and 69 years. It is important to note that if identification of cases was universal across all the population, these figures may vary considerably. It is vital that reliable, comparable data is available internationally, to facilitate comparison of mortality data in Italy, Spain and other countries such as Germany or the USA (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>

One study found that 40% of seriously ill patients had hypertension. Other comorbidities potentially associated with poor outcome include such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular and lung disease. This prevalence of hypertension has led to associating the possibility of treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARA2 and the severity of COVID-19, which we discuss below.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>1.3</label><title>Structure and genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virion</title><p id="p0110">The family <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> is a large group of viruses infecting animals and humans.

Two cellular receptors have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 so far: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD147. After receptor interaction, the cleavage of S protein by the cell surface-associated transmembrane protease serine 2 TMPRSS2 promotes the fusion of viral and cell membranes. Following the release of the nucleocapsid to the cytoplasm, the viral genomic RNA is translated through ribosomal frameshifting to produce polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which undergo cotranslational proteolytic processing into the 15 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp10 and nsp12-nsp16) that form the replication-transcription complex (RTC). The RTC is involved in the genomic RNA replication and in the transcription of a set of nested subgenomics mRNAs required to express the structural and accessory protein genes.

Evidence emerging over the past 2 decades suggests that antibodies against different coronavirus can cross-react to some extent and mediate ADE (<xref rid="bb1375" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). ADE in the context of SARS-CoV was thought to be mediated by antibodies produced against 229E-CoV (<xref rid="bb1400" ref-type="bibr">Yip et al., 2014</xref>) and was contemplated as contributing to high mortality rates in China (<xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2005</xref>). The described mechanism suggests that low affinity or low title anti-Spike protein antibodies rather than neutralizing the virus result in Fc receptor mediated infection of immune cells, further aggravating the dysregulation of anti-SARS-CoV immune responses (<xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">Jaume et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> as well <italic>as in vivo</italic> experimental models have shown that ADE hinders the ability to manage inflammation in the lung and elsewhere.

While the molecular and immunological host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been fully elucidated to confirm ADE is occurring, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been shown to partially cross-react with SARS-CoV, suggesting enhancement is a possibility. With this in mind, ADE in populations previously exposed to other coronavirus can partially explain the geographic discrepancies observed in COVID-19 pathogenesis and severity. Finally, ADE can have several implications in vaccine development as low-affinity or low-titer antibody producing vaccines can increment susceptibility rather than confer protection against the pathogen as has previously been described for a Dengue vaccine(<xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Halstead, 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">Halstead, 2016b</xref>; <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">Halstead, 2016c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>1.6</label><title>Molecular diagnosis methods to detect COVID-19</title><sec id="s0050"><label>1.6.1</label><title>RT-qPCR</title><p id="p0290">Detection methods based on nucleic amplification are often used in the case of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other viruses because of high sensitivity and specificity, particularly in the acute phase of infection (<xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">Kelly-Cirino et al., 2019</xref>).

There are several types of serological tests available, including ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), IIFT (indirect immunofluorescence test), lateral flow immunoassays and neutralization tests. Immunoassays assays are very useful because they allow to study the immune response(s) to SARS-CoV-2 in a qualitative and quantitative manner. In addition, help to determine the precise rate of the infection (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Amanat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0945" ref-type="bibr">Pang et al., 2020</xref>), and to determine more precisely the fatality rate of the infection (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Amanat et al., 2020</xref>). Several SARS-CoV-2 targeted serological tests are commercially available or in development (<xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">FIND, n.d.</xref>). A recently developed kit, reported a sensitivity of 88.66% and specificity of 90.63% (<xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>) using SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM combined antibody rapid (within 15 minutes) test (<xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Despite their simple and fast readout and their potential for being used outside laboratory environments (bedside, small clinics, airports, train stations, etc.), serological tests have a critical disadvantage; given the fact that antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear after 6 days or longer (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2020</xref>) after the illness onset (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Al Johani and Hajeer, 2016</xref>), tests based on this principle have a lag period of approximately 4 to 7 days post-infection. During this lag period, infected and non-infected individuals will both result in a negative output. In addition, it is important to highlight that because serological tests depend on the ability to produce antibodies, intrinsic immunological differences and/or responses between individuals, can significantly affect the outcome of these tests. Recently, some commercially available immunoassays received CE Mark for professional use (<xref rid="bb1115" ref-type="bibr">Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology, n.d.</xref>; <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Diagnostics, 2020</xref>), and therefore are registered as in vitro diagnostic devices.</p><p id="p0325">Currently, there are a plethora of antibody tests for COVID-19 with variable performance (sensitivity varying from 45 to 100%, specificity from 96 to 100%, reviewed in (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics) (<xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">FIND, n.d.</xref>). Different manufacturers of serological assays declare that their assays have no cross reactivity to other human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.

There is still non-specific information for the recommendation of masks, in general, having in several studies claims that surgical or cotton cloth masks do not prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Bae et al., 2020</xref>). The evidence about the transmission of the virus in the asymptomatic period also changed the containment measures, suggesting the community use of masks. It is from this that the recommendations for the rational use of masks arise since in some countries the massive use of N95 masks was reported, masks indicated for the use of medical personnel (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2020b</xref>). Regarding to this non pharmaceutical recommendations, the studies suggest to priories the resources on vulnerable population, in endemic areas, older people, adult with comorbidities and health workforce. Studies are still needed on the duration of the protective effect of the masks and above all the possibility of their reuse for resource optimization.

In terms of this public health urgency is important to consider 2 important definitions: Drug repurposing and compassionate use of drugs. The first one, drug repurposing is a crisis arrangement in which medicines having already been proved safe in humans, in similar virus or targets in the infection process, are redirected against unique objective: SARS-CoV 2 (viral structure, infection process). The second one, compassionate use of drugs is the use of a new unofficial, not yet proven drug to treat a severe sick patient in the absence of other available treatments. These concepts have been applied with COVID-19 treatment.</p><p id="p0830">Identifying targets for pharmacological use has been important to develop therapeutically drugs with roles in virus structure and infection process (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Some representative existing drugs act on targets in similar RNA viruses like Ebola, hepatitis C, influenza, and others as MERS and SARS viruses. The most important studied targets are the 2 viral proteases involved in cleavage viral peptides for replication of the virus, 3CLpro and PLpro. Thus as drug repurposing appears Lopinavir and Ritonavir (<xref rid="bb0765" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). RdRp is other important target as the polymerase in charge of viral RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase, sttopped by Remdesivir and Favipiravir. About endocytosis process into host cells, viral spike protein and its interaction with ACE2 receptor constitute other important target blocked by arbidol, used also in Influenza. ACE2 is a negative regulator, receptor of renin-angiotensin system, involved in pressure control and inflammatory lung disease. By the knowledge of physiopathology of COVID-19 infection, we know that activities of ACE2 receptors are altered, thus some drugs are being studied around these targets, but also in vitro and experimental way. Some homologue target-drug models have been proposed between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 because of some viral similarities as the receptor RBD in S protein with 76% of sequence similarity.

T cell epitope mapping showed that CD8+ responses were targeting SARS-CoV membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins and CTL memory could last up to 11 years after infection (<xref rid="bb0910" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest that vaccine strategies employing viral structural proteins that can elicit effective, long-term memory T cell responses could yield fruitful results.</p><p id="p0985">On the other hand, the S1 spike protein region containing the ACE receptor binding domain (RDB) is the obvious option when neutralizing antibody responses are considered (<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Al-amri et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, a candidate SARS vaccine antigen consisting of the RBD of SARS-CoV Spike protein was created and found it could elicit robust neutralizing antibody responses and long-term protection in vaccinated animals (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0990">The fact that COVID-19 convalescent sera shows potential as a therapeutic approach (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Casadevall and Pirofski, 2020</xref>) aligns with the theory that efficient B cell responses are mounted and lead to production of protective antibodies. Two different groups, using an immunoinformatic approach mapped several CTL and B cell epitopes on different proteins of the virus (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Baruah and Bose, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0490" ref-type="bibr">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, various CTL epitopes were found to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, illustrating their probable capacity to elicit immune responses (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Baruah and Bose, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0490" ref-type="bibr">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, these identified B and T cell epitopes could be potential targets for therapeutic vaccines.</p><p id="p0995">However, important safety considerations should be taken into account before releasing a new vaccine in the market. Previous studies on macaque models have shown that a vaccine-induced anti-Spike protein antibody at the acute stage of SARS-CoV infection can provoke severe acute lung injury (<xref rid="bb0770" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., n.d.</xref>). Similar observations of SARS-CoV vaccine-induced pulmonary injury have also been described in multiple several murine and monkey animal models (<xref rid="bb0805" ref-type="bibr">M et al., 2011</xref>). An additional factor that needs to be checked in phase II and III trials is that the vaccine does not cause ADE of the pathogen, as has previously been described. Such concerns have risen in the context of a Dengue vaccine (<xref rid="bb0825" ref-type="bibr">Mart&#x000ed;nez-Vega et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p1000">Classic vaccine strategies like use of attenuated virus or recombinant protein subunit administration begin to lose support in the scientific community. COVID-19 mainly affects older patients with underlying pathologies that debilitate their immune system. Use of attenuated virus vaccines is contraindicated in these populations as weakened immune systems can permit the reversion of the attenuated pathogen to its wild type state, therefore causing the pathology it was designed to prevent. On the other hand, subunit vaccine design can be challenging when the protein used contains extended glycosylation. Interestingly, nucleic acid-based vaccines showed great promise in response to emerging pathogens like the DNA vaccine designed for Zika virus, entering in Phase I clinical trials (<xref rid="bb1175" ref-type="bibr">Tebas et al., 2017</xref>). Another nucleic acid-based platform for vaccine development, mRNA vaccines, seems a revolutionary strategy. Being designed to possess improved stability and protein translation efficiency these vaccine platforms can act both as adjuvants and antigen sources alike, inducing potent immune responses (<xref rid="bb0955" ref-type="bibr">Pardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0830" ref-type="bibr">Maruggi et al., 2019</xref>). The optimization of the delivery system, such as lipid nanoparticles makes them excellent design candidates (<xref rid="bb1020" ref-type="bibr">Reichmuth et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, delivery systems such as recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus particles or the administration of mRNA molecules that codify for virus-like particles have been proven extremely efficient as testified by the recent FDA approved vaccine against Ebola (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Commissioner O of the, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p1005">In an unprecedentedly swift response to develop and manufacture an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, more than 40 companies and academic institutions are exploring the aforementioned strategies. An example illustrating the rapid reaction of the scientific community to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is that of the biopharmaceutical company Moderna, the first vaccine manufacturer that entered in Phase I clinical trials for one candidate vaccine for COVID-19. On the night of Saturday, January 11, 2020, in the headquarters of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of USA Barney Graham, Deputy Director of the Vaccine Research Center, received the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. During the weekend his group analyzed the data and on Monday, 13 of January he discussed his observations with a group of investigators of the biopharmaceutical company Moderna. On the same day Moderna's infectious disease research team finalized the sequence for mRNA-1273, the company's first vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. On February 7, 2020, the first clinical batch of Moderna was completed. On February 24, 2020, the clinical batch was shipped from Moderna to the NIH to be used in their own Phase I clinical study. On March 4, 2020, the U.S. FDA gave the green light for mRNA-1273 to begin clinical trials. Twelve days later, on March 16, 2020, the NIH announced that the first participant in its Phase I clinical study received the first dose of mRNA-1273. The time between virus sequencing to beginning of Phase I trials was a record total of 63 days.</p><p id="p1010">The pharmaceutical companies that are currently on a race to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 along with the vaccine developing strategies they are using are summarized in <xref rid="t0040" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>

A) and B) Adenoviral and measles recombinant viral vectors can be manipulated to express and therefore elicit robust immune responses against the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Recombinant subunit vaccine strategies use the Sf9-baculovirus insect cell expression system resulting in the production of high-quality antigen that can be used to elicit immune responses. D) Purified antigen vaccine strategies implicate the replication of large numbers of virus in cell cultures and the subsequent purification of viral antigens to be used for vaccination. E) Attenuated vaccines contain whole pathogen that has been submitted to heat or chemical treatment inactivation. F) Attenuated live pathogen vaccine strategies consist in administering a live pathogen that due to cell culture passaging has lost its virulence. They usually elicit robust and long-term memory immune responses without the need to administer an adjuvant. G) In DNA vaccines the DNA codifying a highly immunogenic antigen is administered and captured by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) leading to antigen production and presentation by these cells. H) Moderna's vaccine candidate already in Phase I clinical trials uses an mRNA vaccine approach whereby the genetic information codifying for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is delivered in LNPs to enhance absorption by APCs. Once uptaken by APCs the mRNA induces the expression of S antigen that is subsequently mounted on and presented by MHC molecules to elicit adaptive immune response.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0035">Fig. 7</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr7_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p1015">As can be easily deduced from <xref rid="t0040" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>, optimistic predictions dictate that a vaccine for COVID-19 will not be ready in the next 12-18 months. An indirect course of action that could help to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic would be a plan of vaccination against influenza strains and <italic>Strepococcus pneumoniae</italic>. Influenza is a major universal health problem accounting for 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 350 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths yearly. For the time period from 17 February 2020 to 01 March 2020 alone the WHO laboratories tested positive for influenza viruses 62423 samples (<xref rid="bb1295" ref-type="bibr">WHO, n.d.</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is the most common cause of community acquired pneumonia. In the present context of COVID-19 global outbreak vaccination against the most prevalent strains of influenza and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> would have a multifaceted effect. Firstly, it would lower the risk of severe disease, reduce hospitalization and admission to already heavily charged ICUs due to these pathologies that could prove critical for weaker health systems that would struggle to carry the burden of combined outbreaks. Moreover, vaccinating health care workers is crucial for reducing the risk of absence due to disease, thereby strengthening the healthcare workforce and minimizing the risk to infect COVID-19 hospitalized patients with additional pneumonia-causing pathogens. Lastly, COVID-19 patients vaccinated for influenza and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> allow their immune system to focus on one pathogen and, therefore, give it a better fighting chance against SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="bb0850" ref-type="bibr">Mendelson, 2020</xref>). High risk groups prioritized for vaccination for these 2 pathogens include pregnant women, persons with immunocompromised immune systems (either due to congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies), children, adults &#x02265; 65 years and health care professionals.</p></sec><sec id="s0215"><label>1.22</label><title>Climate and SARS-CoV-2</title><p id="p1020">Numerous studies confirm that climate has an impact on virus (i.e., influenza, coronavirus, etc.) spread through manipulating the conditions of i) its diffusion, ii) the virus survival outside the host, and iii) the immunity of host population (<xref rid="bb1155" ref-type="bibr">Tamerius et al., 2011</xref>). Meteorological conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation (including ultraviolet (UV) spectrum) and precipitation amount and intensity depend on the latitude and the elevation of the location, thus creating distinct climatic zones in the planet. While in some regions, such as temperate climate zones, human influenza peaks have clear seasonal cycles, in others it is not as predictable (<xref rid="bb1155" ref-type="bibr">Tamerius et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Cox, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0790" ref-type="bibr">Lowen and Steel, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Caini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0850" ref-type="bibr">Mendelson, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p1025">An array of studies, investigating the relationship between climatic factors and the activity of influenza all over the world, concluded that at the high latitudes of the world the peaks of influenza correlate with cold and dry weather conditions (i.e., winter season), while around the equatorial zone, it is more common during the months of high humidity and precipitation (<xref rid="bb1005" ref-type="bibr">Rao and Banerjee, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Dosseh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bb1200" ref-type="bibr">Viboud et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">Finkelman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bb0860" ref-type="bibr">Moura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb1160" ref-type="bibr">Tamerius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb1065" ref-type="bibr">Roussel et al., 2016</xref>). Essentially, it depends on explicit threshold conditions based on monthly averages of specific humidity and temperature. When specific humidity drops below 11&#x02013;12 g/kg and temperature drops below 18&#x02013;21&#x000b0;C, the peak of influenza is stimulated during the cold-dry season, however, for tropical and subtropical (always humid and warm) regions, it is likely to prevail during the high precipitation (&#x02265;150 mm) months (<xref rid="bb1160" ref-type="bibr">Tamerius et al., 2013</xref>). The &#x0201c;cold-dry&#x0201d; set of climatic conditions endorses a greater survival of the virus outside human body, and, thus, results in better transmission (<xref rid="bb0775" ref-type="bibr">Lofgren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bb0790" ref-type="bibr">Lowen and Steel, 2014</xref>).
