This health epidemic demands innovative solutions that require uncovering the key brain areas and cell types mediating the cause of overdose&#x02014; opioid-induced respiratory depression. Here, we identify two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids. These changes implicate the brainstem&#x02019;s breathing circuitry which we confirm by locally eliminating the &#x000b5;-Opioid receptor. We find the critical brain site is the preB&#x000f6;tzinger Complex, where the breathing rhythm originates, and use genetic tools to reveal that just 70&#x02013;140 neurons in this region are responsible for its sensitivity to opioids. Future characterization of these neurons may lead to novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Opioids such as morphine or fentanyl are powerful substances used to relieve pain in medical settings. However, taken in too high a dose they can depress breathing &#x02013; in other words, they can lead to slow, shallow breaths that cannot sustain life. In the United States, where the misuse of these drugs has been soaring in the past decades, about 130 people die each day from opioid overdose. Pinpointing the exact brain areas and neurons that opioids act on to depress breathing could help to create safer painkillers that do not have this deadly effect. While previous studies have proposed several brain regions that could be involved, they have not been able to confirm these results, or determine which area plays the biggest role.</p><p>Opioids influence the brain of animals (including humans) by attaching to proteins known as opioid receptors that are present at the surface of neurons. Here, Bachmutsky et al. genetically engineered mice that lack these receptors in specific brain regions that control breathing. The animals were then exposed to opioids, and their breathing was closely monitored.</p><p>The experiments showed that two small brain areas were responsible for breathing becoming depressed under the influence of opioids. The region with the most critical impact also happens to be where the breathing rhythms originate. There, a small group of 50 to 140 neurons were used by opioids to depress breathing. Crucially, these cells were not necessary for the drugs&#x02019; ability to relieve pain.</p><p>Overall, the work by Bachmutsky et al. highlights a group of neurons whose role in creating breathing rhythms deserves further attention. It also opens the possibility that targeting these neurons would help to create safer painkillers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>opioid respiratory depression</kwd><kwd>breathing</kwd><kwd>preB&#x000f6;tzinger Complex</kwd><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5-OD023116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yackle</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yackle</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Opioids stop breathing during overdose by silencing two small brain sites, with just 140 neurons in the breathing rhythm generator exerting the key effect.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly 400,000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose involving a prescription or illicit opioid between 1999 and 2017 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Scholl et al., 2018</xref>). This epidemic is not unique to the United States and with the increasing distribution of highly potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl, it has become a global public health emergency (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rudd et al., 2016</xref>). Death from opioid overdose results from slow and shallow breathing, also known as opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pattinson, 2008</xref>). Like humans, breathing in mice is severely depressed by opioids and this response is eliminated when the &#x000b5;-Opioid receptor (<italic>Oprm1</italic>) is globally deleted (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dahan et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Oprm1</italic> is broadly expressed, in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including sites that could modulate breathing such as: the cerebral cortex, brainstem respiratory control centers, primary motor neurons, solitary nucleus, and oxygen sensing afferents (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mansour et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kirby and McQueen, 1986</xref>). Therefore, either one or multiple sites could be mediating the depressive effects of opioids on breathing.</p><p>Indeed, multiple brain regions have been shown to independently slow breathing after local injection of opioid agonists (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kirby and McQueen, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mustapic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Prkic et al., 2012</xref>). Although informative, doubts remain for which of these sites are necessary and sufficient to induce OIRD from systemic opioids for three reasons. First, injection of opioid agonists or antagonists into candidate areas modulates &#x000b5;-opioid receptors on the cell body (post-synaptic) as well as receptors on incoming terminals (pre-synaptic). Second, these studies necessitate anesthetized and reduced animal preparations, which alter brain activity in many of the candidate <italic>Oprm1</italic> expressing sites. And third, there is not a standard and quantitative definition for how breathing changes in OIRD, and this makes comparing studies that use different breathing metrics measured in different experimental paradigms challenging.</p><p>To address these limitations, we conducted a detailed quantitative analysis of OIRD in awake animals and identify two key changes to the breath that drive the depressive effects of opioids. These two metrics thereafter define OIRD in our study and can serve as a rubric for others. We then locally eliminate the &#x000b5;-opioid receptor in awake mice, disambiguating pre and post-synaptic effects, and use these metrics to define two key brain sites that mediate OIRD. Recently, a similar approach demonstrated some role for these sites in OIRD (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Varga et al., 2020</xref>). Among these two sites in our study, we find that one is dominant and driven by just 140 critical neurons in vitro and, importantly, these neurons are not required for opioid-induced analgesia, suggesting a neutral target for developing safer opioids or rescue strategies for opioid overdose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Up to now, OIRD has generally been described as a slowing and shallowing of breath (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pattinson, 2008</xref>). We therefore felt it was important to more precisely, quantitatively describe the changes in breathing in hopes of elucidating potential mechanisms of respiratory depression. We began by asking whether specific parameters of the breath are affected by opioids. We monitored breathing in awake, behaving mice by whole body plethysmography after intraperitoneal injection (IP) of saline for control and then 20 mg/kg morphine at least 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Compared to saline, breathing after morphine administration (in normoxia) became much slower and inspiratory airflow decreased, each by 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This culminated in&#x000a0;~50% decrease in overall minute ventilation (MV&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;approximated tidal volume x respiratory rate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating that 20 mg/kg morphine is, indeed, a suitable dose to model OIRD.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Changes to breathing during opioid-induced respiratory depression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative examples of the breathing airflow (mL/sec.) in normoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub>) measured by whole body plethysmography. 15 min before recordings, animals are intraperitoneally (IP) injected with either saline (black) or 20 mg/kg morphine (red).

This prevented a precise characterization of breath parameters that dictate OIRD. To overcome this, we measured breathing in hypercapnic air (21% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) which normalizes behavior and thus breathing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As in normoxia, morphine depressed respiratory rate (by 50%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), peak inspiratory airflow (by 60%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), and minute ventilation (by 60%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Hypercapnic breaths after saline exhibited two phases, inspiration and expiration, each lasting about 50 msec. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). After morphine, only the inspiratory phase (measured as inspiratory time, Ti) became substantially longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Additionally, hypercapnic breaths showed a new, third phase after the initial expiration (measured as expiratory time, Te, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>) that was characterized by prolonged little to no airflow (&#x0003c;0.5 mL/sec.) preceding hypercapnia induced active expiration (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Pisanski and Pagliardini, 2019</xref>). We define this new phase as a pause (low airflow + active expiration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>). Such pauses lasted up to several hundred milliseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), accounting for about one-third of the average breath length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Thus, the 50% decrease in respiratory rate after morphine administration is primarily due to prolonging of Ti and pause phases, and the increased prevalence of time spent in pause significantly contributes to the decrease in minute ventilation.</p><p>Typically the length of inspiratory time is determined by a stretch-evoked feedback signal from the lung which terminates inspiration (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">West, 2005</xref>). This reflex is represented by the correlation observed between Ti and peak inspiratory airflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Breaths in morphine still maintain this correlation despite having a longer Ti and decreased inspiratory airflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). As a result, morphine breaths have a similar approximated tidal volume (TV) compared to saline control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L,M</xref>). In other words, as opioids decrease inspiratory airflow, Ti displays a compensatory increase to preserve TV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1N</xref> and <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2018</xref>). In summary, opioids cause only two primary changes to the breath, namely, 1) decreased inspiratory airflow and 2) addition of a pause phase that delays initiation of subsequent breaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). These two parameters can both be controlled by the breathing central pattern generator, the preB&#x000f6;tzinger Complex (preB&#x000f6;tC), in the brainstem and suggest that this may be a key locus affected during OIRD (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, the preB&#x000f6;tC has been proposed to play a key role in OIRD since localized injection of opioids results in respiratory depression and localized naloxone reverses decreased breathing after administration of systemic opioids (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Montandon and Horner, 2014</xref>). However, such experiments fail to distinguish between the action of opioids on presynaptic terminals (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mudge et al., 1979</xref>) of distant neurons projecting into the preB&#x000f6;tC versus direct action on preB&#x000f6;tC neurons themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>;&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dobbins and Feldman, 1994</xref>;&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al., 1999</xref>) To overcome this, we genetically eliminated the &#x000b5;-Opioid receptor (<italic>Oprm1</italic>) from preB&#x000f6;tC cells exclusively, sparing projecting inputs, by stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus constitutively expressing Cre (AAV-Cre-GFP) into the preB&#x000f6;tC of <italic>Oprm1</italic> flox/flox (<italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>) adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Injection site specificity was confirmed by the restricted expression of Cre-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>), and subsequent <italic>Oprm1</italic> deletion, was inferred. To establish a baseline, we first measured breathing after administration of saline and morphine in normoxia and hypercapnia in intact animals, as described above. At least one month after bilateral injection of virus into the preB&#x000f6;tC, we then re-analyzed breathing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). With this protocol, each animal&#x02019;s unique breathing and OIRD response serves as its own internal control, which is necessary due to the variability in OIRD severity between mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Oprm1</italic> in the preB&#x000f6;tC did not affect breathing observed after saline injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), suggesting that in this context, opioids do not exert an endogenous effect. In contrast, breathing was markedly less depressed by morphine administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>) compared to the intact control state: breaths were twice as fast (3 to 6 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,H</xref>), the peak inspiratory flow was larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,I</xref>), and pauses were nearly eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,J</xref>). Notably, histological analysis confirmed that AAV-Cre-GFP expression was localized to the preB&#x000f6;tC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>), and AAV-GFP or tdTomato injected control mice without removal of <italic>Oprm1</italic> showed no change in OIRD compared to the pre-injected control state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H&#x02013;J</xref>), demonstrating that animals do not develop tolerance to opioids within our experimental timeline. Importantly, rescue of OIRD similarly occurred in normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>) and was also specific to breathing since opioids induced analgesia in tail-flick assay after deletion of <italic>Oprm1</italic> in the preB&#x000f6;tC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Necessity of preB&#x000f6;tC ventrolateral brainstem in opioid-induced respiratory depression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a sagittal section through the adult mouse brain.

To determine which neural class mediates the depression of preB&#x000f6;tC activity, we measured rhythmic bursting activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) after selectively genetically deleting <italic>Oprm1</italic> from each neural class.

Strikingly, the bursting rhythm of <italic>Slc17a6</italic>-Cre;<italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> slices was not slowed by DAMGO, whereas the rhythm in <italic>Gad2</italic>-, <italic>Slc32a1</italic>-, and <italic>Slc6a5</italic>-Cre; <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> slices was entirely eliminated, akin to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>). This demonstrates that glutamatergic excitatory neurons, representing&#x000a0;~50% of all preB&#x000f6;tC <italic>Oprm1</italic>-expressing neurons and therefore 4% of preB&#x000f6;tC neurons, mediate OIRD in vitro.</p><p>Next, we dissected the glutamatergic <italic>Oprm1</italic> preB&#x000f6;tC neurons by two developmental transcription factors, <italic>Dbx1</italic> or <italic>Foxp2</italic> (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gray, 2013</xref>), to determine if a subset can rescue rhythm depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Triple-labeling of <italic>Dbx1</italic>-YFP, OPRM1 fused to mCherry (OPRM1-mCherry), and FOXP2 protein quantified within a single preB&#x000f6;tC revealed three molecular subtypes of P0 <italic>Oprm1</italic> glutamatergic neurons: 92&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9 Dbx1, 50&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2 Dbx1/FOXP2, and 20&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4 FOXP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>).

Elimination of <italic>Oprm1</italic> from both genotypes was sufficient to rescue the frequency and amplitude of preB&#x000f6;tC bursting in DAMGO, and the Dbx1 rescue was comparable to elimination of <italic>Oprm1</italic> from all glutamatergic neurons, while the Foxp2 rescue was substantial, but partial (~50&#x02013;60%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). This shows that opioids silence a small cohort (~140) of glutamatergic neurons to depress preB&#x000f6;tC activity, and that a molecularly defined subpopulation, about half, can be targeted to rescue these effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that two small brainstem sites are sufficient to rescue opioid induced respiratory depression in vivo. Between them, the preB&#x000f6;tC is the critical site and we molecularly define&#x000a0;~140 <italic>Oprm1</italic> glutamatergic neurons within that are responsible for this effect in vitro. Future study of these neurons will provide the first example of endogenous opioid modulation of breathing. Furthermore, characterization of these neurons and their molecular response to opioids may extend existing strategies (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Manzke et al., 2003</xref>) or reveal a novel strategy for separating respiratory depression from analgesia and therefore enable the development of novel opioids or related compounds that relieve pain without risk of overdose.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A rubric for studying opioid and other respiratory depressants</title><p>We find that although multiple breathing parameters are impacted by opioids, decreased inspiratory airflow and delayed breath initiation, which we term pause, represent the primary changes that result in OIRD. Pauses occur during expiration and account for tens to hundreds of milliseconds of low airflow per breath. In hypercapnia, these pause periods terminate with an active expiration. The force, timing of inspiration, and expression of active expiration are ultimately determined by the inspiratory rhythm generator, the preB&#x000f6;tC, and focused our initial studies to this site (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Huckstepp et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, correlates of these two changes manifest as decreased burst size and frequency in the activity of the preB&#x000f6;tC slice in vitro. These two key changes in the breath can guide future OIRD studies and efforts to characterize and test novel opioid drugs. Additionally, this workflow can be applied to the analysis of other respiratory depressants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Just two small brainstem sites mediate OIRD</title><p>Our experimental design allowed us to determine that both the preB&#x000f6;tC and PBN/KF have independent and additive rescue of OIRD. Of these two, the preB&#x000f6;tC has the larger magnitude rescue of our two core breathing parameters. The combined deletion of &#x000b5;-Opioid receptor from both sites essentially eliminates OIRD, even to extremely high doses of the potent opioid fentanyl. This suggests that targeting just these two sites is sufficient to rescue opioid respiratory depression. We interpret the small remaining effect of opioids we observe to be due to incomplete transduction of these brain areas but cannot rule out other minor contributing sites. It is also possible, given the challenge of restricting viral transduction, that some of the demonstrated effects are already due to spillover deletion of &#x000b5;-Opioid receptor in neighboring brain areas, such as the bulbospinal rostral ventral respiratory group. Our studies were limited to two opioids (morphine and fentanyl) at a specific dose and it will be important in future work to determine if these two brain sites are also critical for OIRD caused by these opioids at different doses or other opioids altogether.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Depression of preB&#x000f6;tC rhythm by silencing a small glutamatergic subpopulation</title><p>The two hallmark changes during OIRD, decreased inspiratory airflow and delayed initiation, perfectly match the opioid induced depression of amplitude and frequency in the preB&#x000f6;tC slice. We show that&#x000a0;~140 <italic>Oprm1</italic> glutamatergic preB&#x000f6;tC neurons mediate this effect. And surprisingly, half this number, just&#x000a0;~70 glutamatergic neurons are sufficient to rescue opioid depression of the preB&#x000f6;tC rhythm (50 Dbx1/FOXP2 and 20 FOXP2 in <italic>Foxp2-</italic>Cre;<italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 3</xref>). Further, given the importance of Dbx1 neurons in respiratory rhythm generation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>), rescuing <italic>Oprm1</italic> in just&#x000a0;~50/140 Dbx1 neurons (the Foxp2+ subset) may be sufficient to prevent preB&#x000f6;tC depression, the smallest number of neurons we propose. This small number is remarkably consistent with the number of Dbx1 neurons that must be lesioned to arrest preB&#x000f6;tC activity (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Given the similarity of these effects, we hypothesize that opioids are primarily acting by silencing presynaptic release, effectively removing these neurons from the network. Alternatively, it is proposed that just a small subset of preB&#x000f6;tC excitatory neurons may generate the inspiratory rhythm (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>) and perhaps these key <italic>Oprm1</italic> neurons are enriched within this subgroup. In this instance, since hyperpolarization of preB&#x000f6;tC rhythmogenic neurons slows and silences breathing (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Koizumi et al., 2016</xref>), opioids may act postsynaptically as proposed by others (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>). Regardless, it is profound that such a small number can abruptly halt the respiratory rhythm in a network of more than 1000 neurons and suggests that either these neurons act as a key population for rhythmogenesis, or that recurrent excitatory networks are exquisitely sensitive to the number of participating cells. Important future work will need to use the <italic>Dbx1/Oprm1</italic> and <italic>Foxp2/Oprm1</italic> molecular codes to selectively eliminate <italic>Oprm1</italic> from these neurons to test if truly so few neurons profoundly control or modulate breathing in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The isolated brains from neonates and adults were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and dehydrated in 30% sucrose the next 24 hr at 4&#x000b0;C. Brains were embedded and frozen in OCT once equilibrated in 30% sucrose. Cryosections (18&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;M) were washed twice for 5 min in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, once for 10 min in 0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS, and then twice for 5 min in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. Following wash, sections were blocked for 20 min with either 10% goat serum in 0.3% Trition-X100 PBS. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in the appropriate block solution containing primary antibody. Primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-SST (Peninsula T-4103, 1:500), rabbit anti-FOXP2 (Abcam ab16046, 1:500), chicken anti-GFP (Abcam ab13970, 1:500), rat anti-mCherry (Lifetech. M11217, 1:500). After primary incubation, sections were washed three times for 10 min in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, then incubated for 1 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in block containing secondary antibody.

After secondary incubation, sections were washed in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS and mounted in Mowiol with DAPI mounting media to prevent photobleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Plethysmography, respiratory and behavioral analysis</title><p>Adult (8&#x02013;20 weeks) <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were first administered either IP 100&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;L of saline or morphine (20 mg/kg, Henry Schein 057202) and placed in an isolated recovery cage for 15 min to allow full onset of action of the drug. Individual mice were then monitored in a 450 mL whole animal plethysmography chamber at room temperature (22&#x000b0;C) in 21% O<sub>2</sub> balanced with N<sub>2</sub> (normoxia) or 21% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> balanced with N<sub>2</sub> (hypercapnia). For fentanyl (150 mg/kg, Sigma F3886) onset of action was so fast (&#x0003c;10 s) that animals were placed directly in the plethysmography chamber after administration of drug. Each session (combination of drug and oxygen condition) was separated by at least 24 hr to allow full recovery. Breathing was monitored by plethysmography, and other activity in the chamber monitored by video recording, for 40 min periods in normoxia and 10 min periods in hypercapnia. In cases where mice were subject to single or double site AAV injection to delete <italic>Oprm1</italic> or sham controls, breathing was recorded first before viral injection and then again after deletion (or sham) more than 4 weeks later. Breathing traces were collected using EMKA iOX2 software and exported to Matlab for analysis. Each breath was automatically segmented based on airflow crossing zero as well as quality control metrics. Respiratory parameters (e.g. peak inspiratory flow, instantaneous frequency, pause length, tidal volume, etc) for each breath, as well as averages across states, were then calculated. Instantaneous frequency was defined as the inverse of breath duration. Pause length was defined as the expiratory period after airflow dropped below 0.5 mL/sec. The pause period is initially a prolonged airflow around or just above 0 mL/sec. and terminates with an increase in expiratory airflow, likely the active expiration induced by hypercapnia (<italic>11</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>). The 0.5 mL/sec. threshold was chosen since it identifies low airflow pauses that are just above 0 mL/sec. which rarely occur in control hypercapnic breaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>). Although pauses in length 50-100msec. could be considered false positives because they do not have a considerable low airflow period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1 and</xref> , panel 2), they occur at a low rate in saline (1.53%) and we see an increased distribution of pauses in morphine that last hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1 and</xref> , panel 3 and 4). Other respiratory parameters were defined by when airflow crosses the value of 0, with positive to negative being inspiration onset and negative to positive being expiration onset. Note, reported airflow in mL/sec. and tidal volume in mL are approximates of the true volumes. Whole body plethysmography imperfectly measures these parameters without corrections for humidity and temperature. However, since humidity and temperature are largely stable between recordings, because they are conducted in a temperature and humidity stable mouse facility, the estimated airflow (mL/sec.) and tidal volume (mL) can be compared in saline vs. morphine or pre and post-Cre virus injection studies. Additionally, in some instances respiratory parameters are appropriately normalized to animal weight in order to accurately compare between animals. However, this normalization is not appropriate for our study since lung volume in mice does not change in adulthood (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mitzner et al., 2001</xref>), and all respiratory measurements are compared statistically as the ratio of saline to morphine injections within the same animal. The analysis was performed with custom Matlab code available on Github with a sample dataset (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bachmutsky, 2020</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/YackleLab/Opioids-depress-breathing-through-two-small-brainstem-sites">https://github.com/YackleLab/Opioids-depress-breathing-through-two-small-brainstem-sites</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Opioids-depress-breathing-through-two-small-brainstem-sites">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Opioids-depress-breathing-through-two-small-brainstem-sites</ext-link>).</p><p>Due to limitations in breeding, a power calculation was not explicitly performed before our studies. Studies were conducted on all mice generated; six cohorts of animals. After respiration was measured, mice were sacrificed and injection sites were validated before inclusion of the data for further statistical analysis. We first conducted a Shapiro-Wilk normality on the average values (averaged across breaths) of the pre- and post-morphine respiratory parameters (e.g., peak inspiratory flow, instantaneous frequency) from n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;29 animals. We then used either paired Student&#x02019;s t-test (if normal) or Wilcox Rank Sum test (if not normal) to evaluate statistical significance in comparing the distribution of these values. In comparisons of <italic>Oprm1</italic>-deleted vs. Sham conditions a mixed-repeated measure two-way ANOVA was performed to determine if these two groups were significantly different. Post-hoc Student&#x02019;s t or Wilcox Rank Sum tests were then used to evaluate statistical significance between normalized (morphine/saline, or morphine-saline) respiratory parameters for intact vs. <italic>Oprm1</italic> deleted or intact vs. Sham conditions. Normality in this case was determined by Shapiro-Wilk test on the distribution of normalized respiratory parameters from n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;29 animals. All the above statistics were performed using the publicly available Excel package &#x02018;Real Statistics Functions&#x02019; and SPSS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Tail flick assays</title><p>Mice were injected with saline (control trials) or 20 mg/kg morphine. 15 min later mice were put into a restraining wire mesh with the tail exposed. One-third of the tail was dipped into a 48&#x02013;50&#x000b0;C water bath and time was measured for the tail to flick. Immediately after the flick, the tail was removed from the bath. If the tail did not flick within 10 s, then the tail was removed. The procedure was video recorded so time to response could be quantified post-hoc. Each mouse was recorded for two saline and two morphine trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Stereotaxic injection</title><p>Bilateral stereotaxic injections were performed in mice anesthetized by isoflurane. Coordinates used for the preB&#x000f6;tC were: &#x02212;6.75 mm posterior, &#x02212;5.05 mm ventral from surface,&#x000a0;&#x000b1;1.3 mm lateral from bregma. Coordinates used for the PBN/KF were: &#x02212;5.05 mm posterior, &#x02212;3.7 ventral from surface,&#x000a0;&#x000b1;1.7 lateral from bregma. Injection sites specificity was confirmed by the restricted expression of Cre-GFP, GFP, or tdTomato centered in the anatomically defined Parabrachial/Kolliker-Fuse (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>) and preB&#x000f6;tC (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>) areas. In the case of preB&#x000f6;tC injections, anatomical location of injection site was also confirmed by localization with Somatostatin antibody staining (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). &#x000b5;-Opioid receptor deletion was not explicitly demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. After injection of the virus, mice recovered for at least 3&#x02013;4 weeks before breathing metrics were recorded again. In a subset of animals, mice were then subject to a second site deletion of the complementary brain area, ie. preB&#x000f6;tC and then from the PBN/KF (Cohort 1) or vice versa (Cohort 2). These mice were then allowed to recover for another period of at least 3&#x02013;4 weeks, after which a third set of breathing metrics were recorded. A subset of PBN/KF injected mice had only unilateral expression of Cre and their use is acknowledged in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Slice electrophysiology</title><p>Rhythmic 550 to 650 &#x003bc;m-thick transverse medullary slices which contain the preB&#x000f6;tC and cranial nerve XII (XIIn) from neonatal <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>, <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup>;Slc17a6</italic>-Cre+/-, <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup>;Gad2</italic>-Cre+/-, <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup>;Slc6a5</italic>-Cre+/-, <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup>;Slc32a1</italic>-Cre+/-, <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup>;Dbx1</italic>-Cre+/-, <italic>Oprm1<sup>f/f</sup>;Foxp2</italic>-Cre+/- (P0-5) were prepared as described (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2014</xref>).

For recordings, slices were incubated with ACSF from above and the extracellular K+ was raised to 9 mM and temperature to 27&#x000b0;C. Slices equilibrated for 20 min before experiments were started. The preB&#x000f6;tC neural activity was recorded from either XIIn rootlet or as population activity directly from the XII motor nucleus using suction electrodes. Activity was recorded with a MultiClamp700A or B using pClamp9 at 10000 Hz and low/high pass filtered at 3/400 Hz. After equilibration, 20 min. of baseline activity was collected and then increasing concentrations of DAMGO (ab120674) were bath applied (20 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM). Activity was recorded for 20 min. after each DAMGO application. After the rhythm was eliminated or 500 nM DAMGO was reached, 100 nM Naloxone (Sigma Aldrich N7758) was bath applied to demonstrate slice viability. Rhythmic activity was normalized to the first control recording for dose response curves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single cell mRNA sequencing and analysis</title><p>650 &#x000b5;m-thick medullary slices containing the preB&#x000f6;tC were prepared from 10 P0 mice C57Bl/6 mice as described above.

The experimental approaches employed are novel, providing a number of important results that more clearly define the critical brainstem sites and molecular phenotypes of neurons involved in OIRD. The authors' strategy of Cre-viral injection into the preB&#x000f6;tC and/or PBN/KF of Oprm1 (f/f) mice to genetically delete Oprm1 together with the in vivo behavioral analyses to measure the individual and combined contribution of these two functionally defined regions to OIRD proved to be very effective. Also very effective is their use of Vglut2-Cre, Vgat-Cre, Gad2-Cre, or Glyt2-Cre transgenic mouse lines crossed with the Oprm1 (f/f) mice to selectively genetically delete Oprm1 from different neuronal classes, as well as the dissection of the glutamatergic Oprm1 preB&#x000f6;tC neurons by two developmental transcription factors, Dbx1 or Foxp2, all combined with electrophysiological analyses of the rhythmic activity responses to opioid receptor agonists in slices in vitro. The important results are that between the preB&#x000f6;tC and PBN/KF, the preB&#x000f6;tC is the more critical site in vivo, and that at least in the slices in vitro, a small subpopulation (~140) Oprm1-expressing glutamatergic neurons, including Dbx1and Foxp2 expressing glutamatergic neurons, within the preB&#x000f6;tC are responsible for the opioid suppression of rhythmic activity. The paper is well written and the figures and supplementary material very nicely illustrate the essential experimental results. However, there are several concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors try to introduce a "gold standard" definition for how breathing changes in OIRD. Yes, it would be nice if there were a simple gold standard. However, this is not the reality. Gold standard for OIRD should come from a consensus of studies showing similar results. The research presented here show one example of respiratory depression with only one type of opioids, not highly specific for the &#x000b5;-opioid receptors, at only one dosage. Also the "gold standard" proposed here is based upon flow which cannot be reliably measured with whole-body plethysmography. So don't state that you are introducing a gold standard. OIRD is very state dependent and shows huge interindividual variability. Trying to imply that the respiratory rhythm is simply depressed is an oversimplification. Just look at the huge variability in Te (Figure 1H). Plethysmograph recordings are extremely difficult to evaluate, because animals behave, morphine will be sedating before measuring the OIRD, this will not be a static response. We don't understand the definition of inspiratory time, expiratory time, and pause. It seems in Figure 1G that flow doesn't cross the zero at the end of expiration as shown in the figure, but rather at the end of the pause. Is the "pause" only a longer expiration? How was this pause detected or defined? If those pauses are part of expiration, then expiratory time is also increase by morphine. How was the criterion for pause of 0.5mL/sec defined? Knowing that flow is highly variable from one animal to the other it is very likely an unreliable threshold.</p><p>Along the same lines: The authors respiratory assessments in freely-behaving rodents limited for a few reasons: a) using an arbitrary threshold based on flow to define the end of expiration is not reliable. Flow can change from one animal to another, so the duration of their "pause" may differ depending upon the initial baseline of the animal. How do you determine the amplitude, where do you set the threshold = look at Figure 1A, what do you consider a breath and what not?</p><p>b) Using tidal volume or flow as measurements in whole-body plethysmography in rodents is problematic. Unless the right formula is used, it is very difficult to evaluate tidal volume in rodents. In addition, mL cannot be a correct measurement in rodents without normalizing the value according to body weight. Unless all animals have the exact body weight, flow and tidal volume need to be measured as ml/10g or other units. You need to carefully consider these caveats</p><p>c) One of the difficult of measuring breathing with plethysmography is to control for arousal levels. It is well know that sedation by opioids may affect the severity of respiratory depression so arousal levels before morphine may be an issue. Please discuss this important caveat.</p><p>2) While using hypercapnia as a tool may simplify the approach, it will dramatically change the behavioral state of the animal. Under hypercapnia, arousal levels may be severely disrupted and it has been shown that arousal levels are tightly linked to respiratory depression. Hypercapnia will also affect the opiate sensitivity, and this effect will not be uniform in different areas. Carefully discuss this important caveat, and don't imply that this is an advantage, other than the fact that it regularizes the rhythm.</p><p>3) Figure 2 characterizes the necessity of PreB&#x000f6;tC. Without quantitative immunohistochemical confirmation (Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1) it is indeed difficult to know whether the injections were restricted to the preB&#x000f6;tC, same applies to the KF injections. (Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1).</p><p>4) Oprm1-/- animals were not compared with other mice that received injection of scrambled AAV, but were compared to themselves before surgery, microinjection, and recovery. It is possible that the inflammation induced by AAV, and the damage done by the microinjection may change the response to opioids. We recommend that this should be verified with proper controls.</p><p>5) From the transcriptome profiling and neonatal in vitro results, the authors propose that opioids silence a small subset (~140) of glutamatergic neurons to depress preB&#x000f6;tC activity, and that a molecularly defined subpopulation (~70 neurons) can be targeted to rescue these effects. It would be important to emphasize in the Discussion that tests need to be performed in the awake behaving mice in vivo with the transgenic lines utilized for the in vitro studies to determine if so few neurons are also responsible for OIRD in the adult system in vivo.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article "Opioids depress breathing through two small brainstem sites" for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gaspard Montandon (Reviewer #2); Jeffrey C Smith (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper has been previously reviewed and requires some further revisions. All these revisions can be accomplished without any further experiments. Some new analysis in needed but the vast majority of the changes involve rewriting.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are still some outstanding issues that must be addressed.</p><p>Anatomy a) Regarding PBN/KF injection sites, it is clear that these encompassed a much larger area than the targeted region, which is not surprising for targeting these small areas in the mouse brainstem, although it looks like (at least from the examples shown) that the most concentrated fluorescent protein expression may typically be in and immediately around the targeted areas. So it is clear that the authors have included the targeted areas with their stereotaxic injection approach.</p><p>b) Regarding preB&#x000f6;tC targeting, the reconstructions shown in Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1, part A and the two anterior sites in part B are reasonable for demonstrating preB&#x000f6;tC targeting in the mouse, but the labeling for the posterior site reconstructed extends too caudal as the authors have represented the anatomy, implying some receptor deletion in the rVRG. The authors thusly should modify statements in the manuscript regarding site-specificity and that injection sites were confirmed by the restricted expression of Cre-GFP (subsection &#x0201c;Stereotaxic injection&#x0201d;, and figure legends), and they need to discuss any caveats associated with this issue.</p><p>c) Given the results showing functional rescue from depressed breathing frequency and peak inspiratory flow obtained with their Oprm1f/f transgenic and Cre vector construct, their results with control vector injections, and the injection site anatomical reconstructions, it is likely that the authors have deleted some opioid receptors in the regions of interest. We ask the authors to further clarify in the manuscript if/how they have validated deletion of opioid receptors with their experimental approach and to address any associated caveats. The authors could confirm the absence of MOR in knockout animals with Immunohistochemistry.</p><p>Hypercapnia</p><p>Measuring breathing in 5% CO2 likely limits the authors' conclusions. They need to mention that these data are valid in animals that are exposed to CO2, and discuss the issues related to high CO2, low pH, hyperventilation induced by CO2, and reduced arousal, which may limit the role of the preBotC in opioid-induced respiratory depression. The authors don't mention any papers in the discussion related to hypercapnia, medullary sites sensitive to CO2, arousal states, opioid receptor knockout animals etc.</p><p>Pauses</p><p>Definition of pause versus expiration. The definition of a pause according to the authors is when volume goes below 0.5mL during the expiratory period. According to Figure 1G, the last part of the pause with morphine seems to be above this threshold. This arbitrary threshold is concerning. The threshold is likely detecting different pauses in saline versus morphine considering that volume is considerably reduced by morphine. For instance, in Figure 1G, peak flow with saline condition is -6 mL/sec versus -2ml/sec for morphine, with corresponding differences in volume. The use of an absolute value (0.5mL) as a threshold means that the detection of the "pause" will likely be different between saline and morphine conditions, so not due to different timings but different detections. It would be easier to use the simple definitions of inspiratory and expiratory times, which would be consistent with previous reports showing that expiratory duration is affected by opioids. Also, we are not sure what the physiological relevance of a pause is. Is it controlled by different brainstem circuits? The long expirations are likely due to a combination of hypercapnia and hypoxia with morphine.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The authors do not discuss previous studies about MOR-/-, preB&#x000f6;tC, etc. There are many studies investigating this topic that could be discussed in the Discussion. Dahan et al., 2001, Montandon et al., 2011, 2016, Varga et al., 2020, Stucke et al., Mustapic et al., Lalley et al. etc.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="sa2" article-type="reply"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52694.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors try to introduce a "gold standard" definition for how breathing changes in OIRD.

We have now clarified in the manuscript that this is the initial portion of expiration (Results, second paragraph, subsection &#x0201c;A rubric for studying opioid and other respiratory depressants&#x0201d;, subsection &#x0201c;Plethysmography, respiratory and behavioral analysis&#x0201d;, first paragraph).</p><p>3) The pause is defined as the airflow after Te until the onset of the next inspiration.

Is the "pause" only a longer expiration?</p></disp-quote><p>The pause is an expiratory period that occurs after the initial large-amplitude expiratory pulse wherein the majority of tidal volume has been expelled. The pause is characterized by very low airflow and ends with a final brief expulsion of air. Since this phenomenon is being described in hypercapnia, we interpret this terminating expiratory airflow to be "active expiration" (Pisanski and Pagliardini, 2019). The low airflow pause period can vary in length from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. We have now clarified this definition in the second paragraph of the Results, subsection &#x0201c;A rubric for studying opioid and other respiratory depressants&#x0201d; and in the first paragraph of the subsection &#x0201c;Plethysmography, respiratory and behavioral analysis&#x0201d; and have added a supplementary figure (Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1) which shows breaths with different pause lengths aligned by the onset of the pause to better qualitatively demonstrate this phenomenon. Additionally, we have added a description in the Materials and methods and Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2 to clarify how the airflow threshold was chosen to define pause onset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was this pause detected or defined?</p></disp-quote><p>The pause is an apneic period of low airflow which we believe represents a failure or delay to initiate a subsequent breath. This period is qualitatively defined as the point during expiration when expiratory airflow crosses below 0.5mL/sec. All airflow after this point, until the next inspiration begins (continuous airflow below 0mL/sec.) is defined as the pause. In control hypercapnic breathing fewer than 2% of breaths have a pause longer than 5msec. by this definition (Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2). After morphine, ~40% of breaths have a pause between 5 and several hundred milliseconds (Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2). This definition is now clarified in the first paragraph of the subsection &#x0201c;Plethysmography, respiratory and behavioral analysis&#x0201d;and we have added a supplementary figure (Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If those pauses are part of expiration, then expiratory time is also increase by morphine.</p></disp-quote><p>It is certainly true that the overall time between two inspirations does increases. However, the initial portion of expiration (before our pause) does not change in length. This is the data displayed in Figure 1H. We have now clarified our language to include the pause as part of the overall expiratory period in the second paragraph of the Results, subsection &#x0201c;A rubric for studying opioid and other respiratory depressants&#x0201d; and in the first paragraph of the subsection &#x0201c;Plethysmography, respiratory and behavioral analysis&#x0201d;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was the criterion for pause of 0.5mL/sec defined?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see discussion above and Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Knowing that flow is highly variable from one animal to the other it is very likely an unreliable threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the pause analysis was conducted on data from adult animals in hypercapnia, airflow recordings are very reproducible between animals and not "highly variable". For example, for 29 animals recorded, the mean+/-SD for average peak inspiratory airflow after saline injection was 7.2+/-0.57mL/sec. and after morphine injection was 3.60+/-0.62mL/sec. Furthermore, in Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2, where the pause threshold is defined, the data in the scatter plot was generated from 100 breaths from 15 different animals and all data points are intermixed and not clustering as individual animals. Therefore, our pause threshold is chosen to be a reliable metric between animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the same lines: The authors respiratory assessments in freely-behaving rodents limited for a few reasons: a) Using an arbitrary threshold based on flow to define the end of expiration is not reliable. Flow can change from one animal to another, so the duration of their "pause" may differ depending upon the initial baseline of the animal. How do you determine the amplitude, where do you set the threshold = look at Figure 1A, what do you consider a breath and what not?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see explanations above and Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2. Briefly, data and pause threshold between animals is highly reproducible and data from 29 animals was used to define the pause threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Using tidal volume or flow as measurements in whole-body plethysmography in rodents is problematic. Unless the right formula is used, it is very difficult to evaluate tidal volume in rodents.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the criticism that whole-body plethysmography inaccurately measures tidal volume and that a more correct estimate necessitates the incorporation of chamber humidity and temperature via the Drorbaugh and Fenn formula. We have now indicated that the displayed tidal volumes are approximates in the first and third paragraphs of the Results, the first paragraph of the subsection &#x0201c;Plethysmography, respiratory and behavioral analysis&#x0201d;, and in the legend of Figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, mL cannot be a correct measurement in rodents without normalizing the value according to body weight. Unless all animals have the exact body weight, flow and tidal volume need to be measured as ml/10g or other units. You need to carefully consider these caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>It is certainly important to normalize the airflow and tidal volume to body weight when animals of very different sizes are being compared. For example, this correction is particularly important when comparing developing rodents where lung size strongly correlates with size. However, we feel that this correction is not appropriate in our manuscript for four reasons:</p><p>1) When different animals are being compared, the respiratory parameters after morphine injection are normalized to those after saline injection recordings. These two recordings are performed within several days of each other (i.e. without significant weight change). All statistical tests are performed on normalized data.</p><p>2) As mentioned above, one mechanism that could explain changes in airflow in differently sized mice is if lung volume increased with body size. However once mice reach their adult size, although their body weight can increase, their lung volume does not. This has been clearly demonstrated with serial computed tomography imaging of lung size (Mitzner, Brown and Lee, 2001).</p><p>3) Another possible mechanism that could contribute to changes in airflow across different sized mice is if increased displacement of air in the plethysmography chamber distorts the airflow signal. However, in a toy experiment wherein the chamber is filled with objects that displace either 20, 25, or 30mL&#x02019;s of air, the total volume of air injected by syringe (10ml) can be accurately calculated in all conditions. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This indicates that normalizing approximate airflow or tidal volume to weight, as a proxy for body volume, will negatively impact the accuracy of those estimates.</p><p>4) We can demonstrate the stability of airflow across recordings over time, even though the animal has gained some weight. When airflows from the same animal, after injection of saline, are compared at the beginning and end of our studies, the airflows are indistinguishable despite some mice increasing in weight (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> where specific breaths in hypercapnia are compared). In this case normalizing by weight would lead the experimenter to believe lung volume significantly decreases as animals increase in weight which would have no biological basis.</p><p>In summary, it is unlikely that either animal weight or size in adult mice is significantly biasing approximated respiratory airflow or tidal volume values, and therefore it would be inappropriate to normalize these values by weight.</p><fig id="respfig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The plethysmograph was filled with either a 20, 25 or 30mL object to approximate a 20, 25, or 30 gram mouse.</title><p>The plethysmograph was injected with 10mL of air and the change in pressure was integrated to calculate a tidal volume.

It is well know that sedation by opioids may affect the severity of respiratory depression so arousal levels before morphine may be an issue. Please discuss this important caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly appreciate that arousal levels impact the distribution of breaths that are taken by awake, behaving mice and in fact, this concern is exactly why we decided to measure breathing before and after morphine in hypercapnia in addition to normoxia (see Results, first paragraph). Although hypercapnia stimulates the respiratory system, it also normalizes the behavior and we presume the arousal state of mice. As a result, as we show in Figure 1, all of the changes in respiratory parameters are more reproducible between mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While using hypercapnia as a tool may simplify the approach, it will dramatically change the behavioral state of the animal. Under hypercapnia, arousal levels may be severely disrupted and it has been shown that arousal levels are tightly linked to respiratory depression. Hypercapnia will also affect the opiate sensitivity, and this effect will not be uniform in different areas. Carefully discuss this important caveat, and don't imply that this is an advantage, other than the fact that it regularizes the rhythm.</p></disp-quote><p>Although it is certain that hypercapnia alters arousal levels, breathing, and sensitivity to opioids, we use the regularization of breathing as a way to dissect the role of the preB&#x000f6;tC and PBN/KF in OIRD. We acknowledge the benefit of hypercapnia (Results, first paragraph) is simply that it regularizes the respiratory rhythm which is in large part due to a reduction of behaviors performed, for example, far less sniffing and grooming. Although the changes to breathing in hypercapnia are quantitatively distinct from normoxia (Figure 1), the ability to eliminate the variability in breathing due to behavior enabled us to quantitively measure how breaths change in morphine and how these changes can be rescued after deletion of Oprm1 in the preB&#x000f6;tC and/or PBN/KF sites.</p><p>Even if hypercapnia produces an altered arousal state that changes the OIRD response, we do not anticipate that it is due to the "masking" a third brain site that it critical for ORID in normoxia. This is because in all the animals studied, we also performed recordings in normoxia that demonstrate a rescue in respiratory rate and peak inspiratory flow after deletion of Oprm1 from the preB&#x000f6;tC and then the PBN/KF which we now include in additional supplementary figures (Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 2, Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 3). This demonstrates that the rescues we observe are not unique to hypercapnia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2 characterizes the necessity of PreB&#x000f6;tC. Without quantitative immunohistochemical confirmation (Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1) it is indeed difficult to know whether the injections were restricted to the preB&#x000f6;tC, same applies to the KF injections. (Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the supplementary figures that detail the preB&#x000f6;tC and PBN/KF viral injections (Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1 and Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 1). These figures now contain a schematic that details the brain anatomy from anterior to posterior brain sections and the extent of Cre-GFP expression from each animal. Note that the overlapping GFP-expressing region from all animals is the preB&#x000f6;tC and PBN/KF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Oprm1-/- animals were not compared with other mice that received injection of scrambled AAV, but were compared to themselves before surgery, microinjection, and recovery. It is possible that the inflammation induced by AAV, and the damage done by the microinjection may change the response to opioids. We recommend that this should be verified with proper controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now used a mixed repeated measures two-way ANOVA to compare our preB&#x000f6;tC AAV-Cre injected animals with the control preB&#x000f6;tC AAV-GFP or AAV-TdTomato injected animals (Figure 2 legend). Additionally, we have added 3 new control preB&#x000f6;tC injected animals (new total is n=7) in order to match or exceed number of experimental animals (n=6). The addition of new mice has verified our original observations of no change in frequency, airflow and pause in control injected animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) From the transcriptome profiling and neonatal in vitro results, the authors propose that opioids silence a small subset (~140) of glutamatergic neurons to depress preB&#x000f6;tC activity, and that a molecularly defined subpopulation (~70 neurons) can be targeted to rescue these effects. It would be important to emphasize in the Discussion that tests need to be performed in the awake behaving mice in vivo with the transgenic lines utilized for the in vitro studies to determine if so few neurons are also responsible for OIRD in the adult system in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>The limited expression of Oprm1 within the preB&#x000f6;tC coupled with the in vivo OIRD rescue observed after deletion of Oprm1 from the preB&#x000f6;tC makes (which is likely even incomplete, i.e. not all cells are expressing viral), makes the powerful prediction that just a small number of neurons is capable of dramatically changing the respiratory rhythm in vivo. Still, at the end of the Discussion we have now clarified that this is an important hypothesis that future experiment should test directly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Please note, during the course of the revision we validated that our dose of morphine (20mg/kg) does not change respiration in mice completely lacking &#x000b5;OR-/-. This demonstrates that this dose of morphine is specific to &#x000b5;OR. As a result, we have removed a phrase in our Discussion suggesting this dose of morphine could activate kappa and &#x003b4; opioid receptors (per the request of the reviewer in revision round 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are still some outstanding issues that must be addressed.</p><p>Anatomy a) Regarding PBN/KF injection sites, it is clear that these encompassed a much larger area than the targeted region, which is not surprising for targeting these small areas in the mouse brainstem, although it looks like (at least from the examples shown) that the most concentrated fluorescent protein expression may typically be in and immediately around the targeted areas. So it is clear that the authors have included the targeted areas with their stereotaxic injection approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Ok.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Regarding preB&#x000f6;tC targeting, the reconstructions shown in Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1, part A and the two anterior sites in part B are reasonable for demonstrating preB&#x000f6;tC targeting in the mouse, but the labeling for the posterior site reconstructed extends too caudal as the authors have represented the anatomy, implying some receptor deletion in the rVRG. The authors thusly should modify statements in the manuscript regarding site-specificity and that injection sites were confirmed by the restricted expression of Cre-GFP (subsection &#x0201c;Stereotaxic injection&#x0201d;, and figure legends), and they need to discuss any caveats associated with this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Subsection &#x0201c;Stereotaxic injection&#x0201d; now indicates that the site-specificity is indicated by the center of the Cre-GFP expression. We also have added additional discussion (subsection &#x0201c;Just two small brainstem sites mediate OIRD&#x0201d;) to note that we cannot exclude &#x000b5;OR deletion from neighboring regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Given the results showing functional rescue from depressed breathing frequency and peak inspiratory flow obtained with their Oprm1f/f transgenic and Cre vector construct, their results with control vector injections, and the injection site anatomical reconstructions, it is likely that the authors have deleted some opioid receptors in the regions of interest. We ask the authors to further clarify in the manuscript if/how they have validated deletion of opioid receptors with their experimental approach and to address any associated caveats. The authors could confirm the absence of MOR in knockout animals with Immunohistochemistry.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified our methodology and describe that the Cre-GFP determined injection site-specificity indicates where the &#x000b5;-opioid receptor deleted. Although we infer a deletion by the rescue of OIRD, we indicate that we do not explicitly confirm deletion by immunohistochemistry (Results, fourth paragraph and subsection &#x0201c;Stereotaxic injection&#x0201d;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hypercapnia</p><p>Measuring breathing in 5% CO2 likely limits the authors' conclusions. They need to mention that these data are valid in animals that are exposed to CO2, and discuss the issues related to high CO2, low pH, hyperventilation induced by CO2, and reduced arousal, which may limit the role of the preBotC in opioid-induced respiratory depression. The authors don't mention any papers in the discussion related to hypercapnia, medullary sites sensitive to CO2, arousal states, opioid receptor knockout animals etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer that our conclusions are limited to 5% CO2 and a limited role of the preB&#x000f6;tC for two simple reasons:</p><p>1) Much of the presented data are in under 5% CO2 conditions for uniformity and clarity of data presentation. However, as indicated in our experimental methods and Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 2 and Figure 3&#x02014;figure supplement 3, the OIRD rescues in peak inspiratory flow and frequency observed in 5% CO2 also occur in normoxia.</p><p>2) If 5% CO2 &#x0201c;[limits] the role of the preB&#x000f6;tC in opioid induced respiratory depression&#x0201d; (as suggested above), then elimination of &#x000b5;OR from the preB&#x000f6;tC would not result in rescued OIRD. This is simply not what we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pauses</p><p>Definition of pause versus expiration. The definition of a pause according to the authors is when volume goes below 0.5mL during the expiratory period. According to Figure 1G, the last part of the pause with morphine seems to be above this threshold. This arbitrary threshold is concerning. The threshold is likely detecting different pauses in saline versus morphine considering that volume is considerably reduced by morphine. For instance, in Figure 1G, peak flow with saline condition is -6 mL/sec versus -2ml/sec for morphine, with corresponding differences in volume. The use of an absolute value (0.5mL) as a threshold means that the detection of the "pause" will likely be different between saline and morphine conditions, so not due to different timings but different detections. It would be easier to use the simple definitions of inspiratory and expiratory times, which would be consistent with previous reports showing that expiratory duration is affected by opioids. Also, we are not sure what the physiological relevance of a pause is. Is it controlled by different brainstem circuits? The long expirations are likely due to a combination of hypercapnia and hypoxia with morphine.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that by introducing the concept of a &#x0201c;pause&#x0201d; period is important for two reasons: 1) it is the most accurate way to describe our data and 2) reflective of the underlying physiology.</p><p>1) Perhaps the most obvious qualitative change in breathing under morphine are that many breaths have long periods (lasting several hundred milliseconds at 20mg/kg morphine) of little to no airflow (Figure 1A and D, Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1). We sought to rigorously and quantitatively describe this phenomenon. As we show in Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2, we do not &#x0201c;arbitrarily&#x0201d; choose the 0.5mL/sec. threshold, and instead chose this threshold because it identifies essentially no pauses in hypercapnia after saline injection (only 1.53% of breaths have a pause). Although pauses in length 50-100msec. could be considered false positives because they do not have a considerable apneic period (see Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1, panel 2), they occur at a low rate in saline (1.53%) and we see an increased distribution of pauses in morphine that last hundreds of milliseconds (Figure 1I, see Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1, panel 3 and 4). We now clarify this in the first paragraph of the subsection &#x0201c;Plethysmography, respiratory and behavioral analysis&#x0201d;.</p><p>2) We interpret the &#x0201c;pause&#x0201d; period as a delay to initiate the subsequent breath and this implicates the preB&#x000f6;tC in OIRD. This falls in line with the fact that the autonomous respiratory rhythm generated by the preB&#x000f6;tC slice slows after bath administration of opioid agonists, independent of any other brain areas. Further, after deletion of Oprm1 from the preB&#x000f6;tC pause lengths are significantly decreased (Figure 2J). Since our recordings occur in hypercapnia, the pause terminates with a brief active expiration. However, active expiration depends upon preB&#x000f6;tC activity (Huckstepp et al., 2016) and thus remains consistent with the pause reflecting a delay in preB&#x000f6;tC inspiratory initiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>The authors do not discuss previous studies about MOR-/-, preB&#x000f6;tC, etc. There are many studies investigating this topic that could be discussed in the Discussion.
