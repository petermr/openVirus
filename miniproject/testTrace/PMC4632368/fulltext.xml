Although many caesarean sections are performed for concerns about fetal welfare on the basis of abnormal cardiotocography, the majority of babies are shown to be well at birth, meaning that the operation, with its inherent short and long term risks, could have been avoided without compromising the baby&#x02019;s health. Previously, fetal scalp blood sampling for pH estimation was performed in the context of an abnormal cardiotocograph, to improve the identification of babies in need of expedited delivery. This test has largely been replaced by lactate measurement, although its validity is yet to be established through a randomised controlled trial. This study aims to test the hypothesis that the performance of fetal scalp blood lactate measurement for women in labour with an abnormal cardiotocograph will reduce the rate of birth by caesarean section from 38&#x000a0;% to 25&#x000a0;% (a 35&#x000a0;% relative reduction).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Prospective unblinded randomised controlled trial conducted at a single tertiary perinatal centre. Women labouring with a singleton fetus in cephalic presentation at 37 or more weeks&#x02019; gestation with ruptured membranes and with an abnormal cardiotocograph will be eligible. Participants will be randomised to one of two groups: fetal monitoring by cardiotocography alone, or cardiotocography augmented by fetal scalp blood lactate analysis. Decisions regarding the timing and mode of delivery will be made by the treating team, in accordance with hospital protocols.</p><p>The primary study endpoint is caesarean section with secondary outcomes collected from maternal, fetal and neonatal clinical course and morbidities. A cost effectiveness analysis will also be performed. A sample size of 600 will provide 90&#x000a0;% power to detect the hypothesised difference in the proportion of women who give birth by caesarean section.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This world-first trial is adequately powered to determine the impact of fetal scalp blood lactate measurement on rates of caesarean section.

Although many caesarean sections are performed for concerns about fetal welfare, the majority of babies are shown to be well at birth, meaning that the operation, with its inherent short- and long-term risks, could possibly have been avoided, without compromising the baby&#x02019;s health. This project is a randomised trial of fetal scalp blood sampling for lactate measurement during labour, with a view to reducing the caesarean section rate for apparently non-reassuring fetal status. The trial proposal derives from the Cochrane systematic review of intrapartum fetal scalp blood sampling for lactate measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which highlighted the need for a randomised trial of its effectiveness.</p><p>It is imperative that a randomised controlled trial of lactate measurement be conducted so that potentially unnecessary caesarean sections can be avoided, that may otherwise harm, rather than help, mothers and their babies. As such, this will be a world-first trial.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>The burden of disease associated with caesarean sections</title><p>Despite the evidence that caesarean section rates above 15&#x000a0;% seem to do more harm than good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], countries such as Australia, the United States of America and China report alarmingly high rates of 27-50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Australian caesarean section rate of 32&#x000a0;% translates to over 95,000 women having this surgery per year, with over 39,000 of these occurring following the onset of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Risks that are increased with a caesarean birth include anaesthetic risks, maternal infection, venous thromboembolism, haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and intensive care unit admissions for babies with breathing difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Having had a caesarean section delivery increases risks in subsequent pregnancies of having further caesarean sections, stillbirth, rupture of the uterus, hysterectomy and increased bleeding due to the placenta implanting over the scar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These concerns must be balanced against the need on occasions to urgently deliver a sick baby who would be compromised by remaining in the uterus.</p><p>A common indication for caesarean sections following the onset of labour is the identification of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern. The chief investigator of this study has previously found that 38&#x000a0;% of Australian labouring women, where a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern had been identified, proceeded to delivery by caesarean section if no further testing of fetal well-being was performed (i.e. for pH or lactate). On the other hand, the caesarean section rate was 10&#x000a0;% when such testing was undertaken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cardiotocography assessment of fetal well-being during labour</title><p>Cardiotocography (CTG), which detects and records the fetal heart rate by Doppler along with uterine contractions, was introduced into clinical practice in the 1960s with the aim of improving perinatal outcomes by improving intrapartum fetal welfare surveillance. A recent clinical audit revealed that 71&#x000a0;% of labouring women have continuous CTG in labour at the Royal Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Melbourne. Fetal heart rate patterns can be classified in a number of ways. These include: (i) normal/reassuring; and (ii) when non-reassuring, a range of terms including non-reassuring, suspicious, atypical, abnormal, pathological or ominous. These classifications are based on the fetal heart rate, its variability and the presence of accelerations or decelerations, compared with the occurrence of uterine contractions. Several groups have published guidelines in an attempt to provide uniformity of interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Consistent with these guidelines and with the review team&#x02019;s clinical practice, this protocol generally refers to &#x0201c;non-reassuring fetal status or abnormal /CTG/patterns&#x0201d;, rather than the term &#x0201c;fetal distress&#x0201d;, which is sometimes used inappropriately to refer to CTGs that do not meet normal/reassuring status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Reassuring patterns require no specific action. Non-reassuring patterns are identified in approximately 15&#x000a0;% of those with CTG monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and may prompt clinical actions ranging from simple manoeuvres, such as maternal position change, improved maternal hydration, through to expedited birth of the baby by caesarean section, forceps or vacuum. These actions aim to prevent or minimise hypoxia in the fetus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Compensation mechanisms for decreased oxygen supply: can the intrapartum CTG identify the baby&#x02019;s response?</title><p>Non-reassuring CTG patterns may reflect adaptations made by the individual fetus to decreases in oxygen supply. Inadequate oxygen supply results in anaerobic metabolism of glucose, which leads to metabolic acidosis and the production of lactate. Low pH is a combined measure of both metabolic acidosis (including base deficit) and the more labile component, respiratory acidosis.</p><p>The differences in individual fetal responses to a decrease in oxygen (and therefore differences in fetal heart rate changes) mean that the positive predictive value of non-reassuring CTG for adverse outcome is low, although the negative predictive value of a reassuring pattern is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This means that a normal CTG almost always indicates reassuring fetal status, while a non-reassuring CTG on its own significantly overestimates the occurrence of babies that would have a poor perinatal outcome if birth were delayed. These features, combined with marked inter-observer variation in CTG interpretation by midwives and doctors, result in high caesarean section rates for non-reassuring fetal status in many hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Fetal scalp blood sampling</title><p>Collection of a small capillary blood sample from the fetal scalp (a fetal blood sample) for blood gas analysis has been used in clinical practice since the 1960s to assist in intrapartum fetal welfare evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Following identification of one abnormal or two non-reassuring features on the CTG, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom recommends fetal blood sampling (FBS) for pH or lactate estimation, with a published action algorithm based on the result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Following rupture of the amniotic membranes and at cervical dilatation greater than or equal to approximately 3&#x000a0;cm, an amnioscope is placed vaginally to allow adequate visualisation of the fetal head. A small sample of blood is then taken from the fetal scalp. This procedure may be uncomfortable and intrusive for the mother and is invasive to the baby. Rare complications include fetal scalp infection and haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and it is contra-indicated when the mother is known to have HIV or viral hepatitis, or where there is suspicion of a bleeding tendency in the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, such testing has required approximately 30 to 50 microlitres of blood, which is often difficult to obtain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Even when the clinician is able to collect this quantity of blood, samples are frequently rejected by the testing equipment due to contamination with air or amniotic fluid. Some equipment can analyse for other components, such as lactate. Fetal lactate testing equipment requiring a much smaller blood volume (as little as 5 microlitres) is now available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Fetal blood sampling for pH estimation: what is the supporting evidence for use?</title><p>The Cochrane systematic review of intrapartum CTG for fetal welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] reported that:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In a meta-analysis of five RCTs enrolling 18,700 mother/baby pairs, the relative risk (RR) for caesarean section was 1.96 (95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals [CI] 1.23 to 3.09) for the continuous CTG group compared with intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Meta-analysis of six RCTs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15,000) resulted in an RR of 1.5 (95&#x000a0;% CI 1.10 to 2.06) for caesarean section when fetal well-being was monitored by CTG and fetal scalp blood pH sampling, versus intermittent auscultation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Only one of the published RCTs compared outcomes following allocation to CTG&#x02009;+&#x02009;FBS (pH) or CTG alone: four of 229 women in the CTG&#x02009;+&#x02009;FBS group underwent caesarean section, compared with 41 of 230 in the CTG-only group, yielding a relative risk of 0.64 (95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals 0.40 to 1.00) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Not all countries follow this line of persuasion, however, with FBS for pH estimation being uncommon in the United States of America, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>The use of pH estimation in Australia has declined, largely replaced by the availability of hand-held bedside lactate testing units, which require much smaller blood samples than for pH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Fetal blood sampling for lactate measurement: an alternative to pH estimation</title><p>A fetal scalp blood sample for lactate measurement (FBSLM) taken within 60&#x000a0;min prior to birth correlates well with umbilical arterial and venous lactate, pH and base excess measured following birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Umbilical arterial (UA) lactate values correlate well with UA pH and base deficit values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Allen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] reported that fetal scalp lactate values greater than or equal to 4.2&#x000a0;mmol/L offered the best sensitivity and specificity for detecting clinically important outcomes. Kruger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] retrospectively examined the predictive values of 326 simultaneous fetal scalp blood estimations of lactate and pH for Apgar scores, umbilical arterial pH, umbilical arterial base deficit and neonatal encephalopathy. Cut-off values were the 75th centile for lactate (4.8&#x000a0;mmol/L) and the 25th centile for pH (7.20). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was significantly greater for lactate than for pH in predicting neonatal encephalopathy and low Apgar score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These findings and evidence from animal studies of the effects of lactate on brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] suggest that lactate estimation may be a better predictor of severe neonatal morbidity than pH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Lactate values that prompt clinical intervention</title><p>Because different lactate values can be simultaneously recorded from different lactate measurement systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], the cut-off lactate value selected to prompt clinical action must be considered specifically for the lactate meter in use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The available data support a lactate value greater than 4.8&#x000a0;mmol/L as a cut-off value for intervention when measured with the Lactate Pro (Arkray, Kyoto, Japan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which is used at the RWH and included the RWH Clinical Practice Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intrapartum lactate values</title><p>Observational studies suggest that fetal lactate concentrations are constant during the first stage of labour in the absence of hypoxia, and that intrapartum lactate measurements are better than estimations of pH for the prediction of severe neonatal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Nordstr&#x000f6;m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] found that, on average, maternal lactate rose by 2&#x000a0;mmol/l per 30&#x000a0;min in the second stage of labour. Fetal lactate concentrations correlate positively with the duration of active pushing at a rate about half that of the maternal lactate (1&#x000a0;mmol/L per 30&#x000a0;min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The question of whether this lactate rise is driven by fetal hypoxia or derived from the mother was investigated by studying the arterio-venous lactate difference at birth. They found that the main contributor to the fetal lactate increase is the fetus itself, especially with prolonged second stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This is also supported by animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. These findings suggest that fetal scalp lactate measurements remain an appropriate indicator of fetal hypoxia in second stage, particularly, for example, when the fetal head is relatively high in the mother&#x02019;s pelvis and a dense epidural analgesia is in place that limits the mother&#x02019;s ability to bear down and give birth to the baby in a short timeframe (i.e. minutes). The clinical appropriateness of performing a FBSLM in response to abnormal fetal heart rate monitoring in active/advanced second stage warrants consideration, where the option of assisting the birth with vacuum or forceps would be a reasonable option, achievable within minutes, rather than delaying this intervention to take a blood sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Appraising the evidence for lactate measurement in labour: Systematic review</title><p>There is only one published systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and risks of fetal scalp lactate sampling used to assess fetal well-being in labour, in the presence of a non-reassuring CTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Only two randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] compared outcomes following fetal scalp blood sampling for pH or lactate measurement. Fetal scalp blood lactate estimation was more likely to be successfully undertaken than pH, with fewer scalp incisions and results available within 60&#x000a0;s. Larger blood volumes and longer test times were required for pH estimation. No randomised trials were identified that compared the use of CTG-only with CTG and lactate, although one ongoing trial has been identified (The SCALP trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]) during the process of updating the published Cochrane systematic review. This creates an untenable dilemma. Lactate measurement has essentially replaced pH estimation clinically, but there is no evidence from randomised trials and systematic reviews supporting its use. The value of using lactate measurements in labour without this evidence is uncertain, given the contribution that pH estimation has previously been shown to make for avoiding caesarean birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>The need for a randomised trial of lactate for assessment of fetal well-being</title><p>It is proposed that undertaking this randomised trial is timely and mandatory because:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Caesarean section following onset of labour is a major contributor to the alarmingly high overall caesarean section rate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Caesarean section increases maternal mortality and morbidity in the index and subsequent pregnancies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Caesarean section may increase fetal/neonatal morbidity in the index pregnancy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fetal blood sampling following identification of a non-reassuring CTG was previously done for pH estimation and was considered the best option to reduce the risk of unnecessary caesarean sections in many clinical settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lactate measurement has replaced pH estimation as the test of choice by FBS in contemporary Australian clinical practice and also in many overseas centres.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although lactate measurement is possible and the technology readily available, it is not widely practiced in Australian and many overseas maternity centres &#x02013; that is, a state of equipoise exists.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There currently exists no RCT data establishing the benefits and risks of FBSLM in labour.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is therefore an urgent need for evidence about the benefits and risks of lactate measurement when a non-reassuring CTG has been identified in labour, to enable childbearing women and their clinicians to make an informed choice for mode and timing of birth.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Aim</title><p>The primary aim of this randomised trial is to determine whether the addition of FBSLM during labours complicated by a non-reassuring fetal heart rate cardiotocography trace reduces the risk of birth by caesarean section, compared with monitoring by CTG alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>When a woman in labour has a non-reassuring CTG, she has a 38&#x000a0;% chance of delivery by caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Fetal scalp blood sampling for lactate measurement following identification of a non-reassuring CTG in labour has the potential to reduce caesarean section rates, without compromising fetal or neonatal well-being. Such a result would mean that the addition of FBSLM can substantially reduce the health and financial burden from birth by caesarean section. This outcome has significant worldwide implications for women&#x02019;s health during and following childbirth. Avoiding a caesarean section in an index pregnancy will influence the health of the mother in future pregnancies and will influence health service provision.</p><p>Notwithstanding the cost of this trial, there are substantial economic savings to be realised should the hypothesis of reducing caesarean section rates be supported by the trial result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Australian public maternity hospitals receive about $5,000 from the government for each caesarean section, i.e. twice the amount allocated for a vaginal birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Even if the results of this trial support the hypothesis and were then translated into practice only partially by Australian maternity centres, the cost of the trial would be covered many times over within a relatively short time period of several years. Worldwide, the cost savings would be of great magnitude.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CEA</term><def><p>Cost-effectiveness analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTG</term><def><p>Cardiotocography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FBS</term><def><p>Fetal blood sample</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FBSLM</term><def><p>Fetal blood sample for lactate measurement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RWH</term><def><p>Royal Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Author&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CE, MAD, COK and SPB designed and are the Chief Investigators on the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) protocol for this trial, which secured funding under the NHMRC Project Grants scheme.
