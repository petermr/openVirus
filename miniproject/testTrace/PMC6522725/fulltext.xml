Moreover, Sa was regarded as a major pathogenic bacterial strain for perinatal infections in pregnant women and their newborns as early as in 1970s. It was the leading cause for sepsis and meningitis in infants and young children, and has been a serious concern in perinatal medicine. Therefore, a rapid, specific, economical and reliable detection technique is particularly required to facilitate the detection of Sa in clinical samples [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>A recently developed nucleic acid amplification technology, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), has been utilized for the detection of various pathogens in seafood and clinical samples, which was first proposed by Notomi et al. in [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with the amplification of 109-fold from single digital copies of the targeted gene. The technology was a PCR-based reaction conducted at a constant temperature (60&#x02013;65&#x000b0;C) for 30&#x02013;60 min using a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity (Bst DNA polymerase). The reaction rate was further increased two to three times by Nagamine et al. [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and two loop primers were specially designed and adopted. This significantly increased the detection sensitivity as compared with conventional PCR, and the reaction time was greatly reduced. Till date, LAMP technology has been successfully applied for the detection of multiple bacterial and viral strains, demonstrating its significant application potential. A novel real-time LAMP (Real Time-LAMP or Real-LAMP) was developed, and first utilized for the diagnostic detection of malaria by Naomi et al. in 2011, with the detection sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 91.7%. Meanwhile, this technology was also tested for HBV detection in China.</p><p>Though LAMP technology has been utilized for Sa detection in aquaculture research, including samples from the red tailed crown fish and tilapia in China [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Sa detection based on Real-LAMP has not yet been reported. Therefore, in this study, a Real-LAMP-based approach was established for Sa detection, which combined the high sensitivity of real-time fluorescent detection and the short detection time course of LAMP, to investigate its feasibility in clinical practice and facilitate the rapid detection of Sa in clinical samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Bacterial strains and bacterial genomic DNA extraction</title><p>The strains were obtained from the Department of microbiology laboratory, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, where the strains were isolated, identified by VITEK 2 automatic microorganism identification instrument, and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C.

However, rapid and reliable detection of Sa infection is an unmet medical need in clinical practice. Therefore, a rapid, specific, sensitive and cost-effective diagnostic methodology was developed in the present study based on Real-time LAMP technology.</p><p>Real-time LAMP is the combination of real-time fluorescent technology and isothermal amplification technology, with the advantages of being simple, rapid and highly specific. The whole process of amplification could be dynamically monitored through Real-LAMP. The high specificity and enhanced amplification efficiency by adoption of multiple specific primers was the unique advantage of LAMP.</p><p>The high specificity of Real-LAMP relied on well-designed primers, which ensured strict alignment between primers and targeted region, not only facilitating major amplification of the targeted sequence but also differentiating one-base pair-difference among all similar templates; to avoid any interference with non-targeted DNA sequences [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the present study, LAMP was performed to detect the presence of DNA samples for Sa and 10 other strains of common pathogenic bacteria. Positive amplification was only observed in Sa, but not in the other 10 strains, indicating high specificity of LAMP primers and no cross-reactivity with other non-targeted strains. In addition, the ring primers against the target sequence could increase the reaction rate and significantly reduce the reaction time. The reaction rate was increased by 3-fold; the positive readout could be visually detected at 17 min after reaction initiation, and the whole reaction could be completed within 45 min, demonstrating significantly reduced detection time as compared with conventional PCR.</p><p>The readout of conventional LAMP was the white precipitates and dependent on visual inspection. However, weak positive results obtained due to low amplification efficiency or minute amount of templates were usually very challenging for visual inspection [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>]. To overcome this challenge, the fluorescent dye SYTO-9 was used in the present study and the ABI7500 system was employed. The real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR instrument was utilized as LAMP platform, which allowed dynamic observation with increased detection sensitivity. However, the SYTO-9 dye could bind to double-stranded DNA if there was dimer formation of primers, which could lead to false-positive result. To test for potential false-positive results, the melting curve was analyzed and no double-peak was found, indicating no primer dimer formation during the reaction and high specificity of our assay setup.</p><p>Though Real-LAMP is a highly sensitive detection technology, it has some limitations. For instance, aerosol pollution was the main cause of false-positive in Real-LAMP [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; the influence of aerosol diffused into the reaction system was sometimes significant due to the high sensitivity of this technique. The fluorescent dye was usually added into the reaction when LAMP was completed, which might result in false-positive because of lid-opening related LAMP product diffusion. In the present study, the SYT0-9 fluorescent dye was added before the reaction to avoid the lid opening step, which can induce aerosol pollution. The lid was opened once and the whole process was completed with the closed lid. Therefore, aerosol pollution from amplification products was effectively prevented. In order to avoid false-positive results, preventive measures should be considered such as ventilation during operation, avoiding repeated lid opening and processing reaction product timely. In addition, the pipette tips should be frequently changed during the reaction system set up.</p><p>Molecular biology-based techniques, such as PCR and real-time PCR assays, have been successfully established for detection of Sa. However, the PCR-based techniques relied on sophisticated apparatus including high precision temperature cycler and gel imager or complex sample-handling procedures, which limited their application in primary medical facilities or epidemic outbreaks requiring rapid &#x02018;on-site&#x02019; detection screening. Although temperature cycler is not required for self-sustained sequence replication and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, the low amplification temperature and poor specificity make it difficult for clinical application. Strand displacement amplification has overcome all the drawbacks of the above assays, but the non-specific nucleic acid sequences within the samples may lead to non-specific amplification. Even though the irrelevant DNA templates could be removed by treating with restriction enzymes, strong background signal was induced simultaneously, which was very difficult to remove afterward [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Given the drawbacks and limitations of conventional nucleic acid amplification technologies, the establishment of alternative methodologies for improved sensitive and specific detection of Sa was needed, and LAMP was an optional approach.</p><p>There are multiple merits of LAMP technology for detecting pathogenic bacteria. First, LAMP has high specificity with no interference by non-targeted DNA sequences; and high efficient amplification occurred once the special regions were strictly recognized by six well-designed primers [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Second, trace amount of template as low as fg/ml could be detected by LAMP, the sensitivity of LAMP was approximately 1&#x02013;2 orders of magnitude folds as compared with other technologies. However, it was also reported that the sensitivity was not significantly increased by LAMP, which might be associated with the differences in manipulation processes adopted by different research groups. Third, the reaction rate was increased by LAMP; and few copies of the targeted gene could be amplified 109 times within 30&#x02013;60 min. Constant temperature was utilized in LAMP without the time consuming steps of temperature alterations. In addition, ring primers were adopted in LAMP, which could significantly increase the reaction rate and further reduce the time and cost. Only one water bath or constant temperature metal bath was required for LAMP, and the readout could be directly visualized without any expensive instrument. Therefore, LAMP has broad applications in developing countries, and has been validated in Africa for HIV and malaria detection.</p><p>Some researchers have used sip gene instead of fbs-B and carried out the LAMP for the detection of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic>. Which gene is better in the detection of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic>, it needs further study [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>As compared with conventional PCR, the working mechanism of LAMP was relatively complicated and the requirement for primer design and selection was very strict [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;20</xref>]. However, real-time LAMP offers dynamic monitoring and detection, and the samples with high concentration of targeted DNA could be detected within 30 min, which greatly reduced the turnaround time [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;25</xref>]. Overall, LAMP is a gene amplification technology that does not require special reagents or instruments, and has the advantages of speed, simplicity, high sensitivity and high specificity [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;30</xref>].</p><p>Given the limited number of samples in the present study, further validation is required with more samples. Meanwhile, since the DNA amount in the clinical samples was varied, and the DNA extraction process was easily interfered, the risk of obtaining non-specific DNA templates remained; so the assay will be repeated using clinical samples such as vaginal secretions for further validation. Optimization of DNA extraction from various clinical samples should be performed in order to extend the LAMP assay from laboratory testing to clinical detection.</p><p>In summary, Real-LAMP used in the present study for Sa detection was demonstrated to have advantages of sensitivity, specificity, speed and ease of operation, and could be considered as a novel detection alternative for Sa with the potential to be a routine clinical assay. The LAMP assay would be continuously improved with the advances in technology, and it is likely that it could be used in the clinical detection of Sa in the near future.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec5" sec-type="funding"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was funded by the General Research Projects of Medical and Health Sciences of Guangzhou City [grant number 20161A010082]; Bureau of Science, Technology and Information of Liwan District of Guangzhou [grant numbers 20151217081 and 2016080067].</p></sec><sec id="sec6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors declare that there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="sec7" sec-type="author-contrib"><title>Author Contribution</title><p>X.-G.
