ZIKV infection may represent a serious disease, causing neonatal microcephaly and neurological disorders. Nowadays, there is no approved antiviral against ZIKV. Several indigenous or endemic medicinal plants from Mascarene archipelago in Indian Ocean have been found able to inhibit ZIKV infection. The purpose of our study was to determine whether essential oil (EO) from Reunion Island medicinal plant <italic>Ayapana triplinervis</italic>, whose thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether (THQ) is the main component has the potential to prevent ZIKV infection in human cells. Virological assays were performed on human epithelial A549 cells infected with either GFP reporter ZIKV or epidemic viral strain. Zebrafish assay was employed to evaluate the acute toxicity of THQ in vivo. We showed that both EO and THQ inhibit ZIKV infection in human cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 38 and 45 &#x000b5;g/mL, respectively. At the noncytotoxic concentrations, EO and THQ reduced virus progeny production by 3-log. Time-of-drug-addition assays revealed that THQ could act as viral entry inhibitor. At the antiviral effective concentration, THQ injection in zebrafish does not lead to any signs of stress and does not impact fish survival, demonstrating the absence of acute toxicity for THQ. From our data, we propose that THQ is a new potent antiviral phytocompound against ZIKV, supporting the potential use of medicinal plants from Reunion Island as a source of natural and safe antiviral substances against medically important mosquito-borne viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Ayapana triplinervis</italic></kwd><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>essential oil</kwd><kwd>antiviral activity</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>medicinal plant</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-24-03447"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Zika virus, belonging to the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, is an enveloped and single-stranded positive-sense RNA mosquito-borne virus close to dengue virus [<xref rid="B1-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ZIKV was first isolated in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 [<xref rid="B2-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The clinical syndromes of ZIKV infection are similar to those of other arbovirus infections and include, among others, fever, headache, and muscle pain. However, unlike other flavivirus, ZIKV infection has been associated with severe disorders, like Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome and meningoencephalitis in infected adults and congenital defects in affected infants [<xref rid="B3-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

The open reading frame of ZIKV genome encodes a single polyprotein, which is post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases to yield three structural (Capsid, C; pre-membrane, prM; and Envelope, E) and seven nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) proteins [<xref rid="B10-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The ZIKV E-protein mediates the binding of viral particles to the host receptors and the virus enters the target cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref rid="B12-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>We recently reported several indigenous or endemic medicinal plants from Mascarene archipelago which are able to inhibit ZIKV infection through various mechanisms of action [<xref rid="B13-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

We further investigated the possible mechanism of action of THQ for inhibiting ZIKV infection. Finally, we aimed at exploring the innocuity of an acute exposure of an efficient antiviral concentration of THQ in vivo.

Noncytotoxic Doses of Ayapana triplinervis EO Inhibit ZIKV Infection in Human Cells</title><p>Within a project aiming to investigate the potential antiviral activity of medicinal plants from Reunion Island recently registered in the French Pharmacopeia, this study evaluated the anti-ZIKV activity of <italic>Ayapana triplinervis</italic> essential oil. After extraction of EO from the fresh aerial part of <italic>A. triplinervis</italic>, we initially performed <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> EO for cellular cytotoxicity using human A549 cells. Dose-dependent experiments showed that the higher nontoxic concentration of EO (more than 90% of cell viability) was 300 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). By nonlinear regression analysis, the CC<sub>50</sub> value was calculated as 475 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref rid="molecules-24-03447-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We reported that ZIKV replicates efficiently in human lung epithelial A549 cells [<xref rid="B40-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, to assess whether EO inhibits ZIKV infection, A549 cells were infected 24 h with the molecular clone of ZIKV expressing the GFP (ZIKV<sup>GFP</sup>) at the MOI (Multiplicity Of Infection) of 1 in the presence of different concentrations (250, 125, 62,5, 31, 25, 15, 62, 7, 8, 4, and 1 &#x000b5;g/mL) of EO throughout the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f001">Figure 1</xref>B).

Thirty-eight volatile organic compounds were identified, accounting for 99.18% of the EO composition. The main identified compound was thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether (THQ), representing 87.06% of the total EO composition (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03447">Table S1</xref>). Such a chemical composition of <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> EO is consistent with a previous report for <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> harvested in Reunion Island, where the concentration of THQ was estimated from 89.9 to 92.8% [<xref rid="B25-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, we decided to investigate the antiviral activity of the main compound THQ isolated from <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> EO after purification by silica gel column chromatography and characterization by GC/MS and NMR (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03447">Figure S1</xref>).

THQ showed no cytotoxicity at concentrations &#x0003c; 150 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The CC<sub>50</sub> values was calculated as 410 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref rid="molecules-24-03447-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As previously performed for EO, the antiviral activity of THQ was assessed using ZIKV molecular clone expressing the GFP. Flow cytometric analysis showed that THQ severely restricted ZIKV infection in A549 cells, yielding 80% inhibition of ZIKV infection at 125 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The IC<sub>50</sub> value was 45 &#x000b5;g/mL (<xref rid="molecules-24-03447-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The selectivity index (SI), which measures the preferential antiviral activity of a drug in a relation to its cytotoxicity [<xref rid="B15-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], was estimated according to the values of CC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> (SI = CC<sub>50</sub>/IC<sub>50</sub>).

Thymohydroquinone Dimethyl Ether Prevents ZIKV Entry in Human Cells</title><p>To characterize the antiviral activity of THQ against ZIKV, different experimental approaches were conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). To assess the effects on the viral entry stage, ZIKV and THQ were simultaneously co-added to the cells during 2 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, Entry). To investigate whether THQ interferes with ZIKV replication, A549 cells were first infected with ZIKV for 2 h and then treated with THQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, Replication). To investigate whether EO directly affects the cell-free virions to abolish the subsequent infection (virucidal effect), ZIKV particles were pre-incubated with THQ for 2h, and then diluted 50-fold prior infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, virus-free particles). THQ was also maintained throughout the experimental period as positive control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, throughout). The preincubation of ZIKV with THQ prior to incubation with A549 cells demonstrated that THQ does not exhibit virucidal effect against ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Also, the treatment of cells with THQ showed no significant effect on ZIKV replication. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f003">Figure 3</xref>B suggest that THQ-mediated inhibition was associated to an inability of ZIKV to initiate a productive infectious cycle. All together, these data suggest that THQ targets the initial stages of ZIKV infection.</p><p>To further elucidate the underlying mechanism of THQ antiviral activity, we subsequently tested the effect of THQ on ZIKV entry steps. We first investigated whether THQ was able to affect viral attachment. Thus, binding assays were performed at 4 &#x000b0;C which allows virus binding but prevents viral entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Epigallocatechin gallate, EGCG, the main polyphenol compound from green tea, which is known to inhibit ZIKV binding, was used as positive control [<xref rid="B14-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. After 1h of ZIKV attachment in the presence of THQ, the temperature was shifted to 37 &#x000b0;C without THQ to allow ZIKV internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Our data show that the percentage of fluorescence in ZIKV-infected A549 cells was similar to untreated control cells. However, EGCG significantly inhibits ZIKV attachment to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that THQ is not able to inhibit ZIKV binding, suggesting that a postattachment step of the infectious virus cycle could be altered.</p><p>To investigate whether THQ inhibits ZIKV internalization step, A549 cells were infected with ZIKV<sup>GFP</sup> at 4 &#x000b0;C for 1h without THQ, then the temperature was shifted to 37 &#x000b0;C to allow virus penetration, in the presence of THQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). The natural flavonoid Q3G, which is known to inhibit ZIKV internalization, was used as positive control [<xref rid="B18-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

These results suggest that THQ is a potent inhibitor of ZIKV internalization process. Thus, THQ-mediated inhibition of ZIKV infection occurs early after virus binding to the cell membrane and could be explained by the incapacity of the ZIKV-attached particles to be internalized into the host cell in presence of THQ.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-24-03447"><title>2.4.

Indeed, zebrafish shares a high genomic homology with humans (&#x0003e;70%) as well as many physiological processes, making it an interesting model for toxicity test and drug development [<xref rid="B38-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We consequently performed intraperitoneal injection of THQ (0.15 mg/g of body weight) for evaluating its potential acute toxicity. This dose (0.15 mg/g of body weight) was chosen as it corresponds to the maximum noncytotoxic concentration estimated in vitro. Any sign of suffering and behavioral changes were carefully checked every day and fish survival was monitored for 6 days. Interestingly, no striking behavioral changes (locomotor activity, feeding behavior, and stress) have been detected in THQ-treated fish compared to controls. In addition, as shown by the respective Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves, from the injection to day 6, THQ-injected fish display a 100% survival similar to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03447-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that THQ does not exhibit acute toxicity in vivo in our experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-molecules-24-03447"><title>2.5. Concluding Remarks</title><p>Recently, we reported that a nonvolatile extract isolated from <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> in Reunion Island exhibited no antiviral effect against ZIKV [<xref rid="B14-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, we showed that a volatile extract from the same plant and represented by an essential oil was efficacious against ZIKV. Whereas the nonvolatile fraction from <italic>A. triplinervis</italic>, which is mainly constituted of alkaloids, coumarins, and polyphenols, has no antiviral effect [<xref rid="B23-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B41-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The terpene derivative-rich <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> EO was effective against ZIKV. We found that a major phytocompound in <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> EO, the thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether, accounts for inhibition of ZIKV in human cells. Interestingly, both EO and THQ are effective against the contemporary epidemic ZIKV strain reducing ZIKV growth up to 3-log. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a noncytotoxic dose of EO and THQ has been demonstrated efficacious against a mosquito-borne RNA virus of medical concern.</p><p>Early viral entry assays revealed that THQ-mediated ZIKV inhibition relates to a blockade in the early stages of virus infection presumably at viral entry level. The antiviral mechanism of THQ is likely close to that of natural flavonoid Q3G as it has been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="B18-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, we hypothesized that THQ-mediated ZIKV inhibition is due to a defect in the endocytosis steps of virus particles. It has recently been reported that clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway involving Axl/Gas6 as entry factors may play a key role in ZIKV entry into the host-cell [<xref rid="B42-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Whether THQ-mediated ZIKV inhibition involves Axl/Gas6 entry factors remains to be investigated. Such studies would also broaden our knowledge on the antiviral mechanisms associated to phytocompounds, such as THQ.</p><p>In conclusion, our data identified, for the first time, the medicinal plant <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> as a new source of antiviral phytocompounds targeting the cell entry of viral pathogens [<xref rid="B13-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B43-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We demonstrated that THQ from <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> EO is a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infection in human cells. It is of great interest to evaluate the toxicity of <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> major phytocompound THQ in vivo. Consequently, we took advantage of a newly established zebrafish model to test the biosafety of THQ extracted from <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> [<xref rid="B35-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B37-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-molecules-24-03447" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We noted that inoculation of THQ at the doses showing antiviral effect against ZIKV in vitro caused no obvious stress nor impaired locomotor and feeding behaviors in inoculated zebrafish. The data obtained in a zebrafish experimental model reinforce the great interest that represents THQ as a newly identified antiviral phytocompound, which could be potentially efficacious against different enveloped RNA viruses known for their incidence in terms of public health. The results presented in this study underscore viral entry inhibitors as a promising class of antivirals and add <italic>A. triplinervis</italic> to the group of medicinal plants and their phytochemicals that interfere with the early stage of ZIKV replication cycle. Whether or not EO and THQ also exert antiviral activity against other medically important flaviviruses such as dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus is a critical issue that remains to be investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-24-03447"><title>3.
