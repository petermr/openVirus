However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV&#x02013;host interactome and drug targets in the human protein&#x02013;protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV&#x02013;host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the &#x0201c;<italic>Complementary Exposure</italic>&#x0201d; pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV&#x02013;host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Comparative genomics</kwd><kwd>Proteomic analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HL138272</award-id><award-id>R00HL138272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Feixiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the past two decades, two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. For example, 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to $100 billion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2), as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated as COVID-19)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, was found in Wuhan, China. As of 24 February 2020, there have been over 79,000 cases with over 2600 deaths for the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide; furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, there are currently no effective medications against 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Several national and international research groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, but effective vaccines are not available yet. There is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.</p><p id="Par3">Although investment in biomedical and pharmaceutical research and development has increased significantly over the past two decades, the annual number of new treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has remained relatively constant and limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

However, traditional structure-based methods are limited when three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which, unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition, targeting single virus proteins often has high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Viruses (including HCoV) require host cellular factors for successful replication during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

For example, network-based drug&#x02013;disease proximity sheds light on the relationship between drugs (e.g., drug targets) and disease modules (molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules within the PPIs), and can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new indications for approved drugs, as well as drug combinations, as demonstrated in our recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we present an integrative antiviral drug repurposing methodology, which combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virus&#x02013;host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network.

In total, we obtained 119 host proteins associated with CoVs with various experimental evidence.

The HCoV&#x02013;host interactome network is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. We identified several hub proteins including JUN, XPO1, NPM1, and HNRNPA1, with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins.

Yet, several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities (including pneumonia) associated with mesalazine usage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Integration of lung-specific gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 host proteins and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup> may reduce side effects of repurposable drugs or drug combinations. Preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Furthermore, we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. However, we expect that our methodology remain to be a useful network-based tool for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs&#x02019; targets with the HCoV&#x02013;host subnetwork in the human interactome. Finally, we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting nCoV host proteins only. Thus, our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only. Thus, combination of the existing anti-virus drugs (such as remdesivir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>) with the network-predicted repurposable drugs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) or drug combinations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, this study offers a powerful, integrative network-based systems pharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drug combinations for the potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other emerging viral infections and other human complex diseases as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>Genome information and phylogenetic analysis</title><p id="Par26">In total, we collected DNA sequences and protein sequences for 15 HCoVs, including three most recent 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 genomes, from the NCBI GenBank database (28 January 2020, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).
