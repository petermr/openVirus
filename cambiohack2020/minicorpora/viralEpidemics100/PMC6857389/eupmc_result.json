    "Dengue fever, the most notorious of vector borne diseases is under global resurgence. Incidence has increased 30 fold with global expansion. It is thus imperative to review the origin, history and current epidemiology of dengue, its transmission, factors responsible for resurgence, surveillance and the treatment options available. India being hyperendemic, national level comprehensive studies to estimate the true burden of dengue along with its geographical mapping is the need of the hour. Through integrated and combined efforts from various sectors and policy makers, prevention of dengue must be identified and intensified to control further disease transmission as there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine against dengue is available in India."
