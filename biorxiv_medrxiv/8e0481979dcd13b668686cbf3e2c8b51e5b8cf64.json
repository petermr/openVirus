The initial cases have been linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, pointing to an animal source of the epidemic (3) . Subsequently, rapid humanto-human transmission of the disease was confirmed in January 2020, and the etiological agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to its genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV discovered in 2003 (4, 5) . The total global case tally has reached 95,333 infections including 3282 deaths and involving 85 countries as of March 5, 2020 (6) . As the virus continues to spread in the human population, obtaining an accurate \"real-time\" picture of the epidemic's trajectory is complicated by several factors including reporting delays and changes in the case definition (7, 8) . Although the epidemic appears to be on a downward trend in China, local transmission continues in Singapore, Italy, South Korea and Iran (2) . Therefore, detailed epidemiological data from these countries is needed to monitor transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time.",

Thus, the distributions of cluster sizes for SARS and MERS outbreaks are characterized by high heterogeneity (18) . To minimize the risk of hospital-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the Ministry of Health of Singapore has restricted the movement of patients and staff across hospitals (20) . Also, because multiple unlinked community cases of COVID-19 have been reported (21) , various social distancing measures have been put in place including advising the public against large social gatherings in order to mitigate the risk of community transmission (22, 23) . These social distancing measures reduce the risk of onward transmission not only within Singapore, but also beyond the borders of this highly connected nation (24).",

It quantifies the average number of secondary cases generated per case. If the reproduction number is below 1.0, infections occur in isolated clusters as self-limited chains of transmission, and persistence of the disease would require continued undetected importations. On the other hand, reproduction numbers above 1.0 indicate sustained community transmission (18, 26) . Using epidemiological data and mathematical modeling tools, we are monitoring the effective reproduction number, Rt, of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Singapore in real-time, and here we report the evolution of Rt by March 5, 2020. Specifically, we assess the effective reproduction number from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset after adjusting for reporting delays, and we also derive an estimate of the reproduction number based on the characteristics of the clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore.",

However, it is possible to adjust epidemic curves by reporting delays using statistical methods (34). The reporting delay for a case is defined as the time lag in days between the date of onset and date of reporting. Here we adjusted the COVID-19 epidemic curve of local cases by reporting delays using a nonparametric method that employs survival analysis techniques (35-37). The 95% prediction limits are derived according to Lawless et al. (38) . For this analysis, we exclude 6 imported cases and 6 local cases for which dates of symptoms onset are unavailable.",

Estimates of Rt>1 indicate sustained transmission; whereas, Rt <1 implies that the outbreak is slowing down and the incidence trend is declining. Hence, maintaining Rt <1 is required to bring an outbreak under control. Using the reporting delay adjusted incidence curve, we estimate the most recent estimate of Rt for COVID-19 in Singapore. We first characterize daily incidence of local cases using the generalized logistic growth model (GLM) after adjusting for imported cases. This model characterizes the growth profile via three parameters: the growth rate (r), the scaling of the growth parameter (p) and the final epidemic size (K). The GLM can reproduce a range of early growth dynamics, including constant growth (p=0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0<p<1), and exponential growth (p=1) (40) . The generation interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a standard deviation of 3.17 days based on refs. (41, 42) . We denote the local incidence at calendar time \" by \" , the raw incidence of imported cases at calendar time \" by \" , and the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval by \" . Then, we can estimate the effective reproduction number by employing the renewal equation (43-45)",

Temporary sustained transmission in early February can be partly attributed to multiple case importations and initiation of local transmission in the region. However, as cases get identified, transmission potential starts to decline after mid-February 2020. While large-scale transmission has not been reported in Singapore, the fact that asymptomatic and subclinical cases are now well documented for COVID-19 (49) suggests that our estimates could be underestimated (50) . On the other hand, it is not clear if asymptomatic or subclinical cases are as infectious as symptomatic cases. Indeed, we have reported that multiple local cases have yet to be traced to existing transmission chains. Additional data collected during the course of the outbreak will help obtain an improved picture of the transmission dynamics (9). These findings emphasize the need to strengthen public health interventions including active case contact tracing activities in countries with emerging transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that current data suggests that imported cases have contributed little to secondary cases in Singapore, with most of the imported cases dating back to the early phase of the epidemic.

Similarly, a recent study has shown an average reporting delay of 6.1 days in China (60) which agrees with our mean estimate for cases in Singapore (7.6 days). Moreover, the scaling parameter for growth rate (p) indicates a sub-exponential growth pattern in Singapore, reflecting the effective isolation and control strategies in the region.

This event was apparently seeded by two visitors from Wuhan China who infected a couple with SARS-CoV-2 at the church. The infected couple likely passed the infection to another case during a Lunar New Year's celebration on January 25, 2020. This case had subsequently infected Grace Assembly of God church staff at the Tanglin branch, generating secondary cases by the time he was reported on February 14, 2020. Two branches of the Grace Assembly of God church at Tanglin and Bukit Batok have been included in this cluster (28, 31). This church serves an average of 4800 people in attendance over the weekend. While the church has momentarily closed, field investigations have not led to conclusive evidence regarding super-spreading transmission (32). No further cases have been added to this cluster as of February 25, 2020. SAFRA Jurong cluster This cluster composed of 8 local cases is linked to a private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong restaurant on February 15, 2020. The restaurant was closed for cleaning from February 16-February 19, 2020 following the dinner function. The latest case was added to this cluster on March 5, 2020.",

Our estimates were not sensitive to changes in parameter . Based on the entire distribution of cluster sizes, we jointly estimated the overall reproduction number R and the dispersion parameter k. Fitting the negative binomial distribution to the cluster data in the empirical distributions of the realizations during the early stages of the outbreak in Singapore, the reproduction number is estimated at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0) after adjusting for the independent and identically distributed observation probability of 50%. The dispersion parameter is estimated at 0.4 (95% CI: 0.1, Inf.) indicating higher transmission heterogeneity.",
