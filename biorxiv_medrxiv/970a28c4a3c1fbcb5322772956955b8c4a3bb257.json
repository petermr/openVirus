Collectively, there were 36% of the COVID-19 patients absent from fever as the onset symptom. In this case, such patients may have been ignored at the early stage if we focused heavily on fever examination for initial screening. Our composite analysis showed that fever remains the most common symptom (83.0%) in patients with COVID-19. However, the proportion of fever is somewhat lower than that of other coronavirus related respiratory illness, such as SARS (100%) 80 81 or middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (98%) 82 . Similarly, the accompanied symptoms of dyspnea (14.5%) and diarrhea (6.1%) are relatively less common in patients with COVID-19 than those seen in SARS and MERS 52 . More importantly, this study revealed an overall CFR of 3.7%, which was quite similar to that reported by the WHO official statistics as of March 5, 2020 (CFR 3.7%, 3,015 died of 80,565 cases) 4 . Nevertheless, the CFR of COVID-19 was much lower than that of SARS (9.6%) 83 and MERS (37.1%) 84 . By far, the mechanisms underlying the varying symptoms and CFR for these three coronavirus-infected diseases are not fully understood. One reason may be that there were still some COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals at the time of the manuscripts submitted, so the outcome (death or recovery) is not known yet.",

To our knowledge, this updated systematic review analyzed the largest number of cases demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, which covers ten countries. As of March 5, 2020, there have been 95,333 confirmed cases distributing over 86 countries 4 . The rapid and wide spreading of the infection has clearly shown the pandemic potential of COVID-19, to which we should pay great attention. Through literature searching and data extraction, we included 3,470 confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the positive assays of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR or antibody detection. The present study showed that the infected patients aged from 17-day to 92-year old. A recent report by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) have shown that 86.6% the patients aged 30-79 years 5 . This study together with China CDC report indicated that the general population, regardless of age, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In our summary, most of the patients (88.2%) had abnormal findings in the lungs with chest CT scan. In some early cases of COVID-19, clear evidence of pneumonia has been shown on HRCT while X-ray radiographic findings are still normal 51 . Thus, chest CT scan should be routinely recommended for the early identification of COVID-19. Routine blood tests showed that 62.8% of COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia, of which the level is relatively lower than that of SARS 86 . Similarly, a large proportion (64.8%) of COVID-19 patients had an increase level of CRP. Taken together, a combination of the epidemiologic history with auxiliary examinations, e.g., chest CT scan and blood tests, will improve the diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19. Our further analysis revealed that patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan in particular) are facing much more severe situations (higher ICU admission rate and CFR) than those diagnosed in other parts of China. Reasons for the tough situations being caught in Hubei province might be as follows. Firstly, the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 had not been cutting down at its early stage in Wuhan, Hubei province. Second, when encountering such a large number of infected patients, a limited healthcare workforce in Wuhan could not support to treat all patients at their mild or moderate stage. This might result in a higher rate of ICU admission or CFR. Since substantial number of patients as well as healthy residents have been kept in lockdown of Wuhan, great efforts are urgently needed to cutdown the virus transmission from COVID-19 patients to local healthy residents.This systematic review has some limitations.

This might have affected the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 to some extents. Third, since the disease is still ongoing, newly published data on COVID-19 might not be included at the time of manuscript submission. Nevertheless, we have summarized the largest number of patients demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the present study. Finally, we could not determine the incubation periods of COVID-19 due to heterogeneity across studies in reporting the timeline of cases.In summary, COVID-19 represents an emerging acute respiratory infection with various clinical presentations that share similarities as well as discrepancies with SARS and MERS. Combining clinical presentations with radiographic findings as well as blood tests may add value in early diagnosis and managements. Dynamic changes of clinical features in the course of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies. Since specific treatments are not available at the moment, urgent efforts should be taken to explore for this emerging disease.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
