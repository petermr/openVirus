HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 exhibited similar 37 half-lives in aerosols, with median estimates around 2.7 hours. Both viruses show relatively long viability 38 on stainless steel and polypropylene compared to copper or cardboard: the median half-life estimate for 39 HCoV-19 is around 13 hours on steel and around 16 hours on polypropylene. Our results indicate that 40 aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for 41 multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. 42 for use under a CC0 license.",

Airborne transmission or fomite transmission were 51 thought to play important roles in the epidemiology of the two zoonotic coronaviruses that emerged this 52 century, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. 6 Airborne transmission may have been responsible for the largest 53 superspreading event during the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003, 7 and numerous nosocomial 54 superspreading events of SARS-CoV-1 were linked to aerosol-generating medical procedures. 8-10 Fomite 55 transmission was also suspected during the SARS epidemic, and one analysis of a nosocomial SARS-56 CoV-1 superspreading event concluded that fomites had played a significant role. 11 57 Given the potential impact of different routes of transmission on the epidemiology of emerging 58 viruses, it is crucial to quantify the virological traits that may shape these aspects of HCoV-19 59 transmission. Here, we analyze the aerosol and surface stability of HCoV-19 and compare it with SARS-60CoV-1, the most closely related coronavirus known to infect humans.12  We evaluated the aerosol stability 61 of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 for up to three hours in aerosols and up to 7 days on different surfaces.62We estimated decay rates of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 in each condition using a 19 nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) 13 and SARS-CoV-1 Tor2 (AY274119.3) 14 were the 67 strains used in our comparison.

Stability on cardboard was evaluated by depositing 50 \u00b5l of virus on the surface and 81 recovering the inoculum by swabbing of the surface, the swab was deposited 1 mL of DMEM. Three 82 replicate experiments were performed for each surface. Viable virus in all surface and aerosol samples 83 was quantified by end-point titration on Vero E6 cells as described previously. 16 The Limit of Detection 84(LOD) for the assays was10 0.5 TCID 50 /mL for plastic, steel and cardboard and 10 1.5 TCID 50 /mL for copper 85 (due to toxicity caused by the copper in the undiluted samples).86The durations of detectability depend on initial inoculum and sampling method, as expected. To 87 evaluate the inherent stability of the viruses, we estimated the decay rates of viable virus titers using a 88 Bayesian regression model. This modeling approach allowed us to account for differences in initial 89 inoculum levels across replicates, as well as interval-censoring of titer data and other sources of 90 experimental noise. The model yields estimates of posterior distributions of viral decay rates and half-91 lives in the various experimental conditions -that is, estimates of the range of plausible values for these 92 parameters given our data, with an estimate of the overall uncertainty.17  We describe our modeling 93 approach in more detail in the Supplemental Materials.94for use under a CC0 license.",

This reduces the efficacy of 130 quarantine and contact tracing as control measures relative to SARS-CoV-1. 21 Other factors likely to play 131 a role include the infectious dose required to establish an infection, the stability of virus in mucus, and 132 environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity. 16,22 In ongoing experiments, we are 133 studying virus viability in different matrices, such as nasal secretion, sputum and fecal matter, and while 134 varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity. 135 The epidemiology of SARS-CoV-1 was dominated by nosocomial transmission and SARS-CoV 136 was detected on variety of surfaces and objects in healthcare settings. 9 HCoV-19 transmission is also 137 occurring in hospital settings, with over 3000 reported cases of hospital-acquired infections. 23 These cases 138 highlight the vulnerability of healthcare settings for introduction and spread of HCoV-19. 10 However, in 139 contrast to SARS-CoV-1, most secondary transmission has been reported outside healthcare settings 23 and 140 widespread transmission in the community is being seen in several settings, such as households, 141 workplace and group gatherings. 142 A notable feature of SARS-CoV-1 was super-spreading events, in which a single infected 143 individual was responsible for a large number of secondary cases, well above the average number denoted 144 by the reproduction number R eff . 7-11,20 A tendency toward such super-spreading events has two important 145 consequences for the epidemiology of emerging infections: it makes any given introduction of infection 146 for use under a CC0 license.",
