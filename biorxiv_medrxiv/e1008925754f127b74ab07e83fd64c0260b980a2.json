Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are therefore essential components of the public health response to outbreaks. 1, [5] [6] [7] These include isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, travel restrictions, school and workplace closures, and cancellation of mass gathering events. [5] [6] [7] These containment measures aim to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the timing and reducing the size of the epidemic peak, buying time for preparations in the healthcare system, and enabling the potential for vaccines and drugs to be used later on. 5 For example, social distancing measures have been effective in past influenza epidemics by curbing human-to-human transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [8] [9] [10] Three major NPIs have been taken to mitigate the spread and reduce the outbreak size of COVID-19 across China. 11, 12 First, inter-city travel bans or restrictions have been taken to prevent further seeding the virus during the",

In Wuhan, where the largest number of infected people live, residents were required to measure and report ther temperature daily to confirm their onset, and those with mild and asymptomatic infections were also quarantined in \"Fang Cang\" hospitals, which are public spaces such as stadiums and conference centres that have been repurposed for medical care. 11 The average interval from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation has dropped from 12 days in the early stages of the outbreak to 3 days in early February, highlighting how the efficiency of disease detection and diagnosis has greatly improved. 15, 16 Third, inner-city travel and contact restrictions were implemented to reduce the risk of community transmission. This involved limiting individual social contact, using personal hygiene and protective measures when people needed to move in public, and increasing the physical distance between those who have COVID-19 and those who do not. 11 As part of these social distancing policies, Chinese government encouraged people to stay at home as much as possible, cancelled or postponed large public events and mass gatherings, and closed libraries, museums, and workplaces. 17, 18 Additionally, to fully cover the suspected incubation period of COVID-19 spread before Wuhan's lockdown, the CNY and school holidays were also extended, with the holiday end date changed from January 30 to March 10 for Hubei province, and Feb 9 for many other provinces. [19] [20] [21] The implementation of these NPIs has coincided with the rapid decline in the number of new cases across China, albeit at high economic and social costs. 15, 16 On February 17, the State Council required localities to formulate differentiated county-level measures for precise containment of the COVID-19 outbreak and the restoration of socioeconomy affected by the outbreak. 22 The timing of implementing and lifting interventions is likely to have been and continue to be important, to take advantage of the window of opportunity to save lives and minimize the economic and social impact. 23, 24 The increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 outside China and establishment of secondary transmission in multiple places highlights its pandemic potential.

We assumed that the pattern of population movements was the same in years when there were no outbreaks and interventions. Adjusted by the level of travel reductions derived from the 2020 dataset where applicable, the second dataset was used to simulate the COVID-19 spread and predict future transmission via population movements under various scenarios, with or without inter-city travel restrictions. Corresponding city-level population data in 2015 for modelling were obtained from the Chinese Bureau of Statistics. 37 The third Baidu dataset measures daily population movements at county level (2862 counties in China) from January 26 through April 30, 2014, as described elsewhere. 38 Based on the assumption that the pattern of population contact was consistent across years when there were no interventions, it was used to estimate inner-city travel and contact reduction under the outbreak and interventions. First, we aggregated data from county to city level and rescaled the daily flows since January 29, 2014 by the mean of the daily flow for the January 26 -28 period, aligning with the date of Wuhan's lockdown and the 2020 CNY holiday.

The epidemics outside of Hubei province likely reached a low level (< 10 cases per day) in late February or early March, while cities in Hubei Province may need another two or three weeks to reach same level as other provinces. The estimated epidemics and peaks were consistent with patterns of reported data by onset date, with a high correlation (p<0.001, R 2 =0.86) found across regions (Figure 2).

Addtionally, if population contact resumed to the normal levels seen in previous years, the lifting of travel restrictions since February 17 might cause the epidemic to rise again (Figure 5 and appendix Figure S5). Therefore, the social distancing intervention should be continued for several months. Additionally, sensitivity analyses suggested that our model could have robustly measured relative changes of efficacy of various interventions on containing the COVID-19 outbreak under different epidemiological parameters and transmission senarios (appendix Figures S6-S12). Discussion Our findings show that combined NPIs, inter-city travel restrictions, social distancing and contact reductions, as well as early case detection and isolations, have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission across China. The lifting of inter-city travel restrictions since February 17, 2020, aiming to minimize the socioeconomic impact, does not appear to lead to an increase in cases if social distancing intervention can be maintained. Additionally, earlier implementation of interventions could have significantly reduced the magnitude and geographical range of the COVID-19 outbreak that has occurred in China. China's vigorous, multifaceted response is likely to have prevented a far worse situation, which would have accelerated spread globally. The lessons drawn from China provide robust evidence and provide a preparation window and fighting chance for containing the spread of COVID-19 in other regions around the World. raised by our findings are important. First, they support and validate the idea that population movement and close contact has a major role in the spread of COVID-19 within and beyond China, 3,14 indicating the global risk of a pandemic via travellers infected with this virus. As the lockdown of Wuhan happened at the late stage of movement before CNY, travel restrictions did not halt the seeding of the virus from Wuhan, but it likely prevented extra cases being exported from Wuhan to a wider area. The second point is that the importance and effects of various NPIs differed. Compared to travel restrictions, improved detection and isolation of cases as well as the social distancing likely had a greater impact on the containment of outbreak. The social distancing intervention reduced contact with people who travelled from the epicentre of the epidemic, who were encouraged to quarantine at home. This is likely to have been especially helpful in curbing the spread of an emerging pathogen to the wider community, and reduced the spread risk from asymptomatic or mild infections. 5 Third, given travel and work resuming in China, the country should consider at least partial continuation of NPIs to ensure that the COVID-19 outbreak is sustainably controlled. For example, early case identification and isolation should be maintained, and social distancing and personal hygiene are still proposed. Teleworking at home and staggered shifts are considered for mitigating COVID-19 transmission in workplaces or during the commute to and from work. Although the number of reported cases in the COVID-19 outbreak in China has decreased rapidly since February, we cannot be certain that the SARS-CoV-2 can be eradicated, as occurred for SARS-CoV. 42 Ours is the most comprehensive study yet in which the effect of NPIs on COVID-19 transmission has been quantitatively assessed. Our model framework accounts for daily interactions of populations, interventions between and within cities, as well as the inherent statistical uncertainty associated with paucity of epidemiological parameters, before and after the interventions. Together with near-real time population movement and case data, our approach can be used for risk assessment for near real-time estimation of the effectiveness of different NPIs in the ongoing outbreaks in different countries. Our network-based SEIR model is methodologically robust and built on the basic SEIR models previously used to predict COVID-19 transmission in its early stages. 3 Additionally, we assessed the effect of interventions by comparing estimates under various scenarios.

            "text": ",44 Third, our models and findings were based on some assumptions on parameterizations. If the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 transmission in other cities across China differed with estimates from the outbreak at the early stage where no NPIs were in place in Wuhan, then our estimates of the effectiveness of interventions in reducing COVID-19 transmission could be biased. Although previous studies have supported the consistent seasonality of travel patterns across years in China and other countries, 14,36 the magnitude and pattern could change year by year. Additionally, inner-city travel restrictions and population contact reductions might not be highly correlated, and other data sources and further investigations are needed to explore this. Fourth, some coverage biases of mobile phone and Baidu users likely exist. Though a high percentage of the population owns mobile phones in China, 45 the mobile user group still does not cover specific subgroups of the population, particularly children, and not all mobile owners use the Baidu location-based service. Therefore, our population movement data may provide an incomplete picture, and the spatiotemporal and demographic variations in the behaviour of phone users could have biased population distribution and travel estimates. Last, we only measured the main the pandemic potential of the virus, should the outbreak spread widely in other countries, it will put a substantial burden on local health systems and society. From a public health standpoint, our results highlight that countries facing potential spread of COVID-19 should consider proactively planning NPIs and relevant resources for containment, given how the earlier implementation of NPIs could have lead to significant reductions in size of the outbreak in China. The results here provide some guidance for countries as to the likely effectiveness of different NPIs at different stages of an outbreak. Suspected and confirmed cases should be identified, diagnosed, isolated and reported as early as possible to control the source of infection, and the implementation of cordon sanitaires or travel restrictions for significantly affected areas may prevent seeding the virus to wider regions. Reducing contact and increasing social distance, together with improved personal hygiene, e.g. hand washing, can protect vulnerable populations and mitigate COVID-19 spread at the community level, and these interventions should be promoted throughout the outbreak to avoid the resurgence. As called for by the World Health Organization, and backed up by our findings for China here, early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, deployed and adjusted to maximise benefits of these interventions and minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions, considering the narrowing window of opportunity around the World. the study, collected data, finalised the analysis, interpreted the findings, and wrote the manuscript.
