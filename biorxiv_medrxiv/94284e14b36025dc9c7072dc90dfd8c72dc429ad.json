Laboratory examination of the COVID-19 nucleic acid positive group of 31 patients, negative group of 23 patients are mainly characterized by reduced lymphocyte counts, increased C-reactive protein. Except for dyspnea, there was no significantly different in the clinical characteristics of the covid-19 nucleic acid negative and positive group[11]. Studies demonstrated that clinical features of clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 nucleic acid positive and negative patients are similar, faster and more accurately methods were urgently needed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The positive diagnosis rate of combination of IgM and IgG detection for patients with COVID-19 negative and positive nucleic acid test was 72.73% and 87.50%. Although several IgM and IgG detection kit promotion were reported by news, however, little study was reported. One study enrolled 6 cases of COVID-19 Gansu Province were analyzed by COVID-19 specific IgM antibody detection kit. 5 cases were positive and 1 case was negative[12]. All rights reserved.

Study analyzed the clinical symptoms of 20 medical workers infected with COVID-19, Compared with normal patients, white blood cell count and liver enzyme showed significantly increased in severe patients, the lymphocyte count in peripheral blood were significantly decreased[14]. In our study, the concentration of hsCRP in the COVID-19 nucleic acid negative and positive groups were 1.10 (0.36, 2.43) and 0.51(0.20, 0.77), separately. It showed significantly difference between the two groups (P=0.0298). C-reactive protein is an acute phase protein synthesized by liver cells when the body is exposed to inflammatory stimuli such as microbial invasion or tissue damage. The detection of CRP is widely used in clinical applications, including the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of acute infectious diseases, the monitoring of postoperative infections, the observation of the efficacy of antibiotics, the detection of disease course and prognosis. In clinical practice, some patients with COVID-19 would suddenly worsen in the later stage and soon enter a state of multiple organ failure. It may be related to the sudden initiation of an inflammatory storm in critically ill patients. The inflammatory storm not",

Timely and accurate diagnosis of it is very important for the detection and therapy of patients. However, in the clinical practice, the detection standard varied partly with rapidly growing awareness of COVID-19. Nucleic acid detection, chest CT, epidemiological history and clinical manifestations were recognized as diagnostic basis[7, 8]. However, the nucleic acid detection had the limitation of operators, time consuming, easy pollution. CT results often can be changed at severely infected patients, and the specificity was also limited. IgM/IgG antibody detection method has the advantages of simple, easy, and high sensitivity.In our study, by evaluating the clinical significance of IgM and IgG for the highly suspected COVID-19 infection patients, we aimed to provide a quick, simple, accurate diagnostic method for the detection of suspected patients.",

It showed significantly difference between the two groups (P=0.0365). Studies demonstrated that the liver function indicators of patients with COVID-19 intensive care unit were significantly higher than those in non-intensive care units[15, 16]. In another 1099 patients from multiple centers study, it found that ALT and AST were also mainly elevated in severe patients[17]. Studies revealed that COVID-19 enters cells mainly through angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Bile duct epithelial cells specifically express ACE2, which is 20 times higher than hepatocytes, suggesting that 2019-nCoV infection may cause bile duct epithelial cell damage[18]. The reason of liver function abnormalities is more mainly due to drugs, systemic inflammation, and multiple organ dysfunction Secondary liver damage, not liver damage caused by the virus itself[19].",
