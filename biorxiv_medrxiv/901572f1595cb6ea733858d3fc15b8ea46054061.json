The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). the mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8 (IQR, 0.6-1.1) 10 9 /L in Wuhan, 1.0 (IQR, 0.7-1.4) 10 9 /L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 10 9 /L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality.

Recently, a report shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shared the same functional host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 7 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors. 7 Another report shows SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2. 8 Since ACE2 receptors on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine are dominant, lung alveolar epithelial cells or enterocytes of the small intestine may be an important susceptibility factor for human. 9 According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic case, mild and severe cases of pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis, septic shock). Severe cases of pneumonia are defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO 2 < 90% on room air. 10 Asymptomatic case has been reported in China and Germany. 11, 12 Huang et al 3 first reported 41 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.

Many specific diseases directly or indirectly cause secondary immunodeficiencies. This includes many types of cancer, and certain chronic virus infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus). Our findings indicated the PLD at presentation were associated with the severity of disease ( Table 3 ). The severe PLD or the secondary immunodeficiencies (CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm 3 ) is common in HIV patients. When CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm 3 , patients with T cell depletion have increased susceptibility to fungal infections. 15, 16 It has been reported that SARS-CoV directly infects monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes in human. 17 The PLD may also be secondary to activation of T lymphocytes. 18 Our findings showed that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes have significant difference (p < 0.01) between mild (Non-ICU) and severe or critical (ICU) cases without glucocorticoid treatment indicating COVID-19 directly effected on immune system is possible.",
