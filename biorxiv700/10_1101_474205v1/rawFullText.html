<meta name="DC.Description" content="Background The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) developed infections that caused serious epidemics. Special priority of awareness and prompt initiative involvement of health workers (HW) during such intensified health situation necessitated an assessment of their preparedness, appropriate attitudes and protective strategies for better efficiency modes and acceleration during emergency.

Methods HW of Prince Sultan Military Medical city in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were reviewed through specifically designed questionnaires to acquire the demanded data. It included clinical and demographic information about the viral diseases, associated signs and symptoms, transmission and protection, and attitudes about the MERS-CoV disease.

Results The study was accomplished between August and November, 2017 and 477 participants of the medical city, successfully completed the study questionnaire ([Appendix I][1]). Females represented a majority and there was an indirectly proportional decrease with the increasing age. Gradual educational increase levels reflected dominance of the university degree holders. Jobs were dominated by nurses and non-Saudis were a majority whilst, the highly experienced, (&gt;10 years) were a minority. A majority recognized the viral transmission methods, popular information sources of MERS-CoV and associated medical terms. Highest scores were observed in dealing with protective aids and recognizing symptoms of disease. High adherence to hand hygiene protocols and correct washing steps were recorded. Correct and high levels were observed in taking preventive measures and avoiding infection. Participants responded correctly to negative and wrong actions that patients should refrain from. High scores were observed in taking appreciable attitudes towards oneself and towards others.

Conclusions Expatriates were majority and nurses were dominant which, necessitates Saudization of this sector. Ministry of health pamphlets and seminars were of less impact in invigilating HW, hence, more attention and efforts are demanded. HW were quite aware of the basic and emergent health policies during epidemic episodes of MERS-CoV.

Special priority of awareness and prompt initiative involvement of health workers (HW) during such intensified health situation necessitated an assessment of their preparedness, appropriate attitudes and protective strategies for better efficiency modes and acceleration during emergency.</p></div><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><p id="p-6"><strong>Methods</strong> HW of Prince Sultan Military Medical city in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were reviewed through specifically designed questionnaires to acquire the demanded data. It included clinical and demographic information about the viral diseases, associated signs and symptoms, transmission and protection, and attitudes about the MERS-CoV disease.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-7"><strong>Results</strong> The study was accomplished between August and November, 2017 and 477 participants of the medical city, successfully completed the study questionnaire (<a id="xref-app-1-1" class="xref-app" href="#app-1">Appendix I</a>). Females represented a majority and there was an indirectly proportional decrease with the increasing age. Gradual educational increase levels reflected dominance of the university degree holders. Jobs were dominated by nurses and non-Saudis were a majority whilst, the highly experienced, (&gt;10 years) were a minority. A majority recognized the viral transmission methods, popular information sources of MERS-CoV and associated medical terms. Highest scores were observed in dealing with protective aids and recognizing symptoms of disease. High adherence to hand hygiene protocols and correct washing steps were recorded. Correct and high levels were observed in taking preventive measures and avoiding infection. Participants responded correctly to negative and wrong actions that patients should refrain from. High scores were observed in taking appreciable attitudes towards oneself and towards others.</p></div><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><p id="p-8"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Expatriates were majority and nurses were dominant which, necessitates Saudization of this sector. Ministry of health pamphlets and seminars were of less impact in invigilating HW, hence, more attention and efforts are demanded. HW were quite aware of the basic and emergent health policies during epidemic episodes of MERS-CoV.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2 class="">Introduction</h2><p id="p-9">The coronavirus that causes acute respiratory infection in humans is known as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and was discovered in 2012 [<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>].</p><p id="p-10">Reports indicate that two-thirds of the infection that effect humans are not related to camels. Kharma and colleagues thus suggested that another species could act as an intermediary to human infection. Since fragments of the human MERS-CoV RNA sequence was isolated in a Taphozous bat [<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>], [<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>] they have since been suspected as a possible source of viral transmission to humans. However, the rare contact between humans and bats implies hypothetically that they are the least responsible for the human infection. For deeper investigation to find the role that bats play as MERS-CoV risk factor of viral transmission, more research is needed [<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>].</p><p id="p-11">Human-to-human transmission is an increasingly public health concern since more than fifty percent of the confirmed secondary cases have been identified within hospitals and healthcare center boundaries [<a id="xref-ref-2-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>]. Most of this coronavirus infections reported in Saudi Arabia were transmitted through human interactions within the health center boundaries, that might have been due to inadequate infection control within these areas [<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>].</p><p id="p-12">Usually the incubation period of MERS-CoV after infection is within two weeks [<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>]. According to recommendations of the WHO and CDC, individuals who had visited the Middle East region within the previous 14 days should be screened for MERS-CoV [<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>]. In a hospital outbreak in September 2012, the first cases of pneumonia that were caused by the new coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were reported by the World Health Organization [<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>]. The reported symptoms in patients included fever, cough, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms, associated with a mortality rate of 65% [<a id="xref-ref-6-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>]. Most patients infected with MERS-CoV show signs of pneumonia and ARDS, as well as acute kidney injury in some of the cases [<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>]. Whether the severity of MERS-CoV in patients depends on other conditions is still not clear [<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>]. One study in Saudi Arabia reported that an overwhelming majority of patients with MERS-CoV had underlying comorbidities [<a id="xref-ref-6-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>]. Previous studies suggest that patients with diabetes, chronic lung diseases, renal failure, or immunocompromised are prone to greater risk of severe coronavirus onsets, however, there is little evidence to suggest that such underlying comorbidities contributed to disproportionate infection of MERS-CoV [<a id="xref-ref-8-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>]. The WHO estimated the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be approximately 30% [<a id="xref-ref-2-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>], [<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">11</a>]. Currently, the treatment is rather non-specific and there are no recommended antiviral agents [<a id="xref-ref-2-4" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>]. Though, Nitazoxanide which is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug is being tested against influenza and other viral respiratory infections and it exhibited appreciable activity against MERS-CoV and other viruses by inhibiting their N protein expression [<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12">12</a>], [<a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13">13</a>]. Since human-to-human transmission is said to occur in more than 60% of the total infections, mostly involving medical staffs, inpatients prone to and are at an increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. The WHO suggested that infection in healthcare settings were due to overcrowding and insufficient control measures [<a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14">14</a>]. Secondly, it would be necessary for the patients to avoid contact with camels or to eat properly cooked camel meat [<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-15">15</a>]. Sufficient knowledge of the etiology and prevention of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus among healthcare professionals is essential in combating the virus.</p><p id="p-13">Significant improvement in patients administered with a combination of ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a was seen, in comparison with controls that received only supportive medical care [<a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16">16</a>]. However, further evaluation of the therapy regimen is required to enable the conclusive use of the therapy in the management of the disease.</p><p id="p-14">Several preventive measures to control infections in healthcare settings, to expedite management of the disease is essential, such as developing of an emergency department visual triage scores for early detection of the MERS-CoV [<a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a>]. It has been shown that the use of triage for early detection of various types of disease had positive outcomes.

Ratios of different groups of HW characteristics like gender, jobs and educational levels reflected a gradual increase approaching higher learning degrees, with Bachelors as a majority, whilst fresh employees were a majority but, the most experienced (&gt;10 years) were the least in number.

Whilst, the highest score recorded by participants, regarding their multiple choice answer about viral transmission of MERS was the unhygienic spread of coughing and sneezing droplets.

Whilst, the most effective method to deal with this situation was to avoid the patients until they recover. Other options were also found to be useful measurements with less variable grades. Investigators and other workers in this field found these measures also useful [<a id="xref-ref-25-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">25</a>].</p><p id="p-48">In evaluating knowledge about associated signs and symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, a majority of the participants chose ‘Diarrhea’ as an answer. On this point, the answer with such an appreciable majority, shouldn’t be overlooked, without some attention. Diarrhea with fever was said to be one of the symptoms of MERS-CoV infection when people were immuno-compromised or organ transplanted, a situation where these patients might not experience the usual route respiratory symptoms [<a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>].</p><p id="p-49">The participants got it quite right in dealing with their protective equipment and showing the right order of putting them on, whilst, they were also correct in taking them off.

In dealing with this type of mask, they were correct in choosing the right steps, which reflects their seriousness and carefulness in entering infected zones, but, they were that quite careful in taking it off, as they put this choice as a second step. Whilst, Attention must be paid to this point, as it might reflect some unjustified hastiness practiced by professionals [<a id="xref-ref-20-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20">20</a>]. Also assessment of the participants reflected their high awareness of infection transmission and protection as precautionary steps for having good hand hygiene experience and practice during rush hours and epidemics. Majorly stating the right timing use reflects the strict adherence to hand hygiene which, is an essential and a basic practice and regime in health fields [<a id="xref-ref-20-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20">20</a>].</p><p id="p-51">In choosing the correct steps in applying and practicing hand wash, the participants were able to get the highest scores which, meant that they understand and are well aware of correct and full hand wash, infection transmission and protection.

They adhered to the basic rule of hand washing throughout the day, before and after every action whilst, they also preferred to avoid infected patients and their contaminated belongings, their own eyes, ears and nose and to eat fruits only after thoroughly washing them. It was important to mention to use proper compensatory methods to prevent cross infection when sneezing or coughing. Keeping always clean and avoiding sources of infection is always a hygienic routine that guarantees awareness and gratifies with success in health media [<a id="xref-ref-2-7" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>].</p><p id="p-53">Attitudes and actions evaluation of the participants towards themselves and towards others reflected high levels of awareness and knowledge. In certain cases of being sick, generally, people commit serious mistakes and decisions, even within the health field workers. Decision to stay at home with such obvious symptoms of, at least common colds, is a serious one. Also to have your prescription such as antipyretics over the counter and join work is not at all advisable. It is a double hazard and a dangerous behavior, to the patient himself and to his colleagues at the same time. It is an appreciable level of knowledge and good practice that the participants responded correctly to these queries, whilst, few ones might have not understood the rest of queries correctly. With seriously infective viruses such as MERS-CoV, it is mostly crucial to get access to the right treatment and avoid spreading the virus in the vicinity [<a id="xref-ref-2-8" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>].</p><p id="p-54">During serious episodes of community viral infections like MERS-CoV, people should take precautionary steps and build good protective attitudes and actions, towards oneself and towards others in the community. It is quite convincing that participants in the health field have built good and correct awareness to take attitudes of taking lots of fluids, having healthy foods and taking sufficient and beneficial body rest.</p><p id="p-55">Whilst, to help in cutting the vicious circuit of infective body contacts, it is always best attitude towards others to clean hands routinely, use disposable tissues to mask coughing and sneezing, and evade shaking hands. It is highly appreciated that participants in health media should stick to building and adhering to such attitudes [<a id="xref-ref-27-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a>].</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-12"><h2 class="">Conclusions</h2><p id="p-56">The majority of the hospital staff was expatriates and the nursing group was the largest which, emphasizes the selective need for Saudization of this health sector. Ministry of health informative pamphlets and seminars about MERS CoV were of less impact, according to the participants opinions, a situation that demanded more attention in this field. Professional HW were quite aware of the basic and newly emergent policies and were very careful of actions before and during their duties in epidemics of seriously infected patient media as those of MERS-CoV.</p><p id="p-57">Attention must be paid by health professionals to using special protective aids, as dealing with them inappropriately might have reflected some unjustified hastiness practiced by them. Strict adherence of HW to correct hand hygiene experience affirmed and guaranteed healthiness and safety whilst, ideal protective attitudes towards themselves and others represented the firm plateau of awareness they had attained in corona virus combat.</p></div><div class="section ack" id="ack-1"><h2 class="">Acknowledgements</h2><p id="p-58">We would like to deeply thank Dr. Susan Al Maddah, Director of the Scientific Research Center (SRC) for supporting this research.
