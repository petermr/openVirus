Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.</p><div id="sec-1" class="subsection"><p id="p-3"><strong>Importance</strong> No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising <em>in vitro</em> antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2 class="">Introduction</h2><p id="p-4">Bunyaviruses are the largest family of viruses, composed of hundreds of members. These segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses are transmitted primarily by an arthropod vector, and several family members pose significant threats to human health. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) frequently infects humans and ruminants, resulting in severe morbidity and mortality. While RVFV is primarily transmitted in Africa and the Middle East, the threat of global spread looms, and recent examples of Zika<sup><a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> and chikungunya<sup><a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> viruses illustrate this tangible hazard. In addition to RVFV, several other bunyaviruses infect humans and are associated with severe pathologies as well. La Crosse virus (LACV), distantly related to RVFV, is a bunyavirus present primarily in the midwestern and eastern United States<sup><a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>. LACV is transmitted by <em>Aedes triseriatus</em>, though <em>Aedes albopictus</em><sup><a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>–<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a></sup> efficiently carries the virus as well. While relatively unknown and frequently undiagnosed, LACV infects and causes neuroinvasive disease in dozens of people every year. In fact, from 2009 to 2018, 679 such cases were reported according to the Centers for Disease Control<sup><a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a></sup>. Further, LACV cases recently have emerged in the southeastern United States, suggesting spread of the virus<sup><a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a></sup>. The ability of LACV to infect <em>Aedes albopictus</em> mosquitos will likely lead to its continuing spread. Despite this spread and the severe disease associated with LACV infection, no antivirals or vaccines are available to prevent or treat infection. Thus, LACV presents a significant threat to human health.</p><p id="p-5">Despite their prevalence, no antivirals are available to treat bunyavirus infection and palliative care is given to patients presenting with LACV encephalitis. While several vaccine candidates have been developed to target RVFV<sup><a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>–<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">11</a></sup>, no similar effort has been invested in anti-LACV therapeutics. With the increasing availability of drug panels to screen molecules for antivirals, rapid investigation and deployment of antivirals for emerging viruses is possible. Several prior screens for antivirals have successfully identified lead molecules and highlighted cellular pathways critical to virus infection. For example, recent screens with chikungunya virus highlighted berberine, abamectin, and ivermectin as promising antivirals<sup><a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12">12</a></sup>. Additionally, Zika virus screens have uncovered known and novel antivirals<sup><a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13">13</a>–<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-15">15</a></sup>, including mycophenolic acid and daptomycin, among others. More closely related to LACV, a RVFV screen highlighted azauridine and mitoxatrone<sup><a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. The ability to rapidly screen molecules highlights an opportunity to identify both unique virus-specific and broad-spectrum antivirals, as these reports have highlighted.</p><p id="p-6">Antivirals may target viral particles, viral processes and critical host-targeted antivirals<sup><a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a></sup>. Host-directed antivirals have gained appreciation recently, as interfering with host processes crucial to viral processes has several benefits, including potential for broad-spectrum activity and a heightened requirement for antiviral resistance beyond minor mutations in the virus. Additionally, numerous approved and available drugs are already available that can be repurposed as antivirals<sup><a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19">19</a></sup>. While significant work remains to be done to identify and verify such antivirals, rapidly screening compounds can provide insight.</p><p id="p-7">Using the NIH’s Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), we obtained and screened &gt;500 compounds for activity against LACV. We identified several known antivirals, including deoxyuridine and quinonone. Importantly, we also identified a variety of novel classes of antivirals, including metal ion chelators. Valinomycin, a top hit in our screen, functions by transporting potassium ions against the electrochemical gradient. We investigated the antiviral activity of valinomycin, observing that valinomycin exhibits antiviral activity in several cellular systems, in a dose-dependent manner and independent of treatment time. We also found that valinomycin does not directly inactivate viral particles, highlighting a cellular role for potassium ions in virus infection. We expanded our results to additional ionophores, observing that some but not all effectively blocked LACV replication. Finally, we determined that valinomycin is broadly antiviral, as it reduced replication of several viruses from diverse families, including flaviviruses and enteroviruses. Together, these data highlight the utility in rapid screening of antiviral molecules as well as a crucial role for potassium ions in LACV infection.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2 class="">Results</h2><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><h3>Development of rapid screening of NIH DTP compounds active against LACV</h3><p id="p-8">We developed a simple, rapid assay to measure antiviral activity in Huh7 cells (<a id="xref-fig-1-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Figure 1A</a>). We plated Huh7 cells to confluency in 96-well plates, to which we added 2 µM drug from the NIH NCI Development Therapeutics Program (DTP). Two hours late, cells were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 plaque-forming units (pfu) per cell. At 48 h post infection (hpi), cells were fixed with formalin and stained with crystal violet stain. Because viable cells robustly stain with crystal violet, while dead cells do not, we could discriminate between live and dead cells. Importantly, any cytotoxic molecule would not stain with crystal violet; thus, stained cells indicate antiviral molecules that are not cytotoxic at 2 µM. Crystal violet stain was subsequently resuspended in 10% acetic acid and absorbance read at 595 nm. To control for inter-plate variability, each plate contained an untreated and infected (low survival), untreated and uninfected (high survival), and ribavirin-treated (400 µM) control (high survival). Absorbances of drug-treated and infected wells (<a id="xref-fig-1-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Figure 1B</a>) were compared to untreated and uninfected controls by dividing their absorbance values (<a id="xref-fig-1-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F1">Figure 1C</a>). This ratio highlighted several candidate antivirals, including lagistase, lapachol, superacyl, and valinomycin. Interestingly, we identified several known antivirals in our screen, including deoxyuridine and nelarabine (summarized in <a id="xref-table-wrap-1-1" class="xref-table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Thus, our assay identified molecules with novel activity against LACV, including some recognized antivirals.</p><div id="T1" class="table pos-float"><div class="table-inline table-callout-links"><div class="callout"><span>View this table:</span><ul class="callout-links"><li class="view-inline first"><a href="##" class="table-expand-inline" data-table-url="/highwire/markup/1120863/expansion?postprocessors=highwire_tables%2Chighwire_reclass%2Chighwire_figures%2Chighwire_math%2Chighwire_inline_linked_media%2Chighwire_embed&amp;table-expand-inline=1" data-icon-position="" data-hide-link-title="0">View inline</a></li><li class="view-popup last"><a href="/highwire/markup/1120863/expansion?width=1000&amp;height=500&amp;iframe=true&amp;postprocessors=highwire_tables%2Chighwire_reclass%2Chighwire_figures%2Chighwire_math%2Chighwire_inline_linked_media%2Chighwire_embed" class="colorbox colorbox-load table-expand-popup" rel="gallery-fragment-tables" data-icon-position="" data-hide-link-title="0">View popup</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="table-caption"><span class="table-label">Table 1.</span> <div class="sb-div caption-clear"></div></div></div><div id="F1" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/23/2020.01.21.914929/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="Rapid screening for LACV antivirals.

As an initial consideration of its antiviral activity, we performed secondary screening on Huh7 cells. Cells were seeded to confluency, treated with increasing doses of valinomycin, from 1 to 64 µM, and infected at MOI 0.1. At 48h, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and stain was quantified by absorbance reading. We observed that valinomycin exhibited antiviral activity at doses above 10 µM, as crystal violet staining was stronger, suggesting more surviving cells (<a id="xref-fig-2-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2A</a>). Doses as high as 64 µM did not affect crystal violet stain, suggesting that cellular viability was not compromised. To confirm this phenotype with titers, we treated cells with increasing doses of valinomycin 2h prior to infection at MOI 0.1 and measured titers by plaque assay at 48 hpi. We observed that viral titers were significantly decreased compared to untreated controls (<a id="xref-fig-2-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2B</a>, dotted line) at concentrations above 1 µM. In fact, viral titers were reduced over 100-fold at 10 µM. We calculated an IC50 value of 1.4 µM. To confirm that cellular viability was not compromised, we used a fluorescent assay to measure cellular ATP content after treatment with increasing doses of valinomycin. We observed cellular toxicity at doses at and above 16 µM (<a id="xref-fig-2-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Figure 2C</a>, CC50 value of 14 µM), though no toxicity was observed either by cellular morphology or fluorescent ATP assay below 10 µM.</p><div id="F2" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/23/2020.01.21.914929/F2.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="Valinomycin is antiviral.

La Crosse virus lacks any approved treatment, and antiviral development could benefit not only LACV-infected patients but perhaps patients infected with related bunyaviruses. Unfortunately, antiviral development is a nonlinear process that has provided no promising targets for this specific virus to date. Our screen is the first to investigate a large number (&gt;500) of compounds in their ability to reduce LACV infection <em>in vitro</em>, and our hits demonstrate that several known antivirals may exhibit anti-LACV activity. Additionally, the identification of novel antivirals, such as valinomycin provides novel avenues of antiviral development.</p><p id="p-23">In our screens, valinomycin consistently exhibited antiviral activity and was selected for follow-up experiments. Based on our results, valinomycin is a host-targeted antiviral with broadspectrum activity. In fact, our tests against eight distinct viruses and four diverse families of virus suggest (1) valinomycin has activity against evolutionarily-distant viruses and (2) these viruses rely on this conserved host process for efficient replication. Precisely why each virus is sensitive to valinomycin is likely virus-specific, though mechanisms for bunyaviruses have been described<sup><a id="xref-ref-22-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-22">22</a>,<a id="xref-ref-24-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. As a potassium ionophore, valinomycin disrupts potassium ion gradients, resulting in aberrant cellular events, including endocytosis. This potassium-dependent endocytosis is required for efficient bunyavirus entry<sup><a id="xref-ref-24-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-24">24</a></sup>. Additionally, a study using Hazara virus, a distantly related bunyavirus, demonstrated that the viral fusion spike conformation was potassium-sensitive<sup><a id="xref-ref-21-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">21</a></sup>. Thus, valinomycin’s antiviral activity fits with the prescribed role of potassium ions during virus infection, both highlighting the importance of this pathway for virus infection and its potential as an antiviral target.</p><p id="p-24">Valinomycin is a naturally occurring cycling peptide, synthesized by <em>Streptomyces</em> species as an antibiotic<sup><a id="xref-ref-25-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">25</a></sup>. In our assays, we did not observe significant cellular toxicity, as measured either by gross cellular morphology or by measuring cellular ATP levels, until doses above 10 µM, while our IC50 of 1.4 µM suggests there is a window of therapeutic potential. However, given the drug’s toxicity <em>in vivo</em>, modification of the valinomycin structure may tune toxicity while maintaining antiviral activity. Additionally, using other, less toxic potassium ionophores may similarly function to inhibit LACV infection, as we observed with nonactin and nigericin. For outbreak viruses like SARS CoV or ZIKV, however, limited valinomycin usage might be beneficial. Interestingly, valinomycin was identified in an earlier screen for anti-SARS-CoV molecules<sup><a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a></sup>, underscoring the antiviral potential of valinomycin despite its negative characteristics. Importantly, the emergence of a new group 2B CoV, nCoV-2019 signals the ongoing threat and need to rapidly respond to novel emergent virues. Additional <em>in vivo</em> testing, combined with medicinal chemistry approaches to structural modification, would be necessary prior to clinical use.</p><p id="p-25">In addition to valinomycin, our screen identified several tantalizing antiviral candidates. In fact, several known antivirals were identified (summarized in <a id="xref-table-wrap-1-2" class="xref-table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Dasatinib has previously been described to inhibit dengue virus and HIV infection<sup><a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a>,<a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a></sup>. Quininone has activity against enterovirus proteases as well as reverse transcriptases<sup><a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-29">29</a>,<a id="xref-ref-30-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-30">30</a></sup>. As mentioned previously, mitoxantrone was identified in a screen for anti-RVFV molecules<sup><a id="xref-ref-16-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16">16</a></sup>. Additionally, we identified a number of cancer therapeutics, targeting processes such as angiogenesis and topoisomerase, that show significant promise. Nonetheless, further verification of antiviral activity and investigation of the mechanisms of action is necessary. Regardless, the development of novel antivirals is crucial to combat virus infection and to respond to the possibility of rapid virus dissemination and evolution. LACV is a significant threat to human health, and continued development of novel antivirals may prove fruitful if the virus were to spread, as arboviruses are wont to do.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-12"><h2 class="">Materials and Methods</h2><div id="sec-13" class="subsection"><h3>Cell culture</h3><p id="p-26">Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies) with bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin.

Primers were verified for linearity using eight-fold serial diluted cDNA and checked for specificity via melt curve analysis following by agarose gel electrophoresis. All samples were used to normalize to total RNA using the ΔC<sub>T</sub> method.</p></div><div id="sec-19" class="subsection"><h3>Genome-to-PFU ratio calculations</h3><p id="p-32">The number of viral genomes quantified as described above were divided by the viral titer, as determined by plaque assay, to measure the genome-to-PFU ratio. Values obtained were normalized to untreated conditions to obtain the relative genome-to-PFU ratio. Primers used were: Small 5’-GGC-AGG-TGG-AGG-TTA-TCA-AT-3’ (forward), 5’-AAG-GAC-CCA-TCT-GGC-TAA-ATA-C-3’ (reverse, Medium 5’-CCT-GCC-TAG-AGA-CTG-AGA-GTA-T-3’ (forward), 5’-GAG-TTG-CAA-TGT-TGG-TGT-AAG-G-3’ (reverse), Large 5’-ACT-GGA-AGG-TCG-AGG-ATC-TAA-3’ (forward), 5’-GTC-GCT-TGT-CTC-ACC-CAT-AAT-A-3’ (reverse), GAPDH 5’-GAT-TCC-ACC-CAT-GGC-AAA-TTC-3’ (forward), 5’-CTG-GAA-GAT-GGT-GAT-GGG-ATT-3’ (reverse).</p></div><div id="sec-20" class="subsection"><h3>Statistical Analysis</h3><p id="p-33">Prism 6 (GraphPad) was used to generate graphs and perform statistical analysis. For all analyses, one-tailed Student’s t test was used to compare groups, unless otherwise noted, with a = 0.05. For tests of sample proportions, p values were derived from calculated Z scores with two tails and a = 0.05.</p></div></div><div class="section ack" id="ack-1"><h2 class="">Acknowledgments</h2><p id="p-34">We are gracious to Drs.
