  <meta name="DC.Description" content="Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small, double-stranded DNA tumor viruses carried by diverse vertebrates. PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus . Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of PyV than geographic distance. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence of inter-family host-switching events of PyV in mammals and challenge the prevailing evolutionary paradigm for strict host restriction of mammalian PyVs. Author summary Since the discovery of murine polyomavirus in the 1950s, polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been considered both genetically stable and highly host-restricted in their mammalian hosts. In this study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans."/>

PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus . Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of PyV than geographic distance. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence of inter-family host-switching events of PyV in mammals and challenge the prevailing evolutionary paradigm for strict host restriction of mammalian PyVs. Author summary Since the discovery of murine polyomavirus in the 1950s, polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been considered both genetically stable and highly host-restricted in their mammalian hosts. In this study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans."/>

     <em>Polyomaviridae</em> by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and classified into four separate genera (
     <em>Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-</em> and 
     <em>Deltapolyomavirus</em>) with nine floating species [

     <h3>Extensive genetic diversity of polyomaviruses among bats</h3>
     <p id="p-13">VP1 genes of PyV were amplified using broad-spectrum primers from 186 positive samples and then cloned into vectors. Four clones derived from each amplicon were sequenced to detect potential co-infection of multiple PyVs in each positive sample. As a result, 180 of 186 bats were confirmed to harbor one PyV, while the remaining 6 had a co-infection with two distinct PyVs (detailed in S1 Table). A total of 192 non-redundant partial VP1 sequences were obtained and phylogenetically compared with VP1 sequences of known PyVs. Results showed that the 192 VP1 sequences had extensive diversity and could be classified into 44 clusters within the 
      <em>Alpha-</em> and 
      <em>Betapolyomavirus</em> genera (
      <a id="xref-fig-2-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Fig 2</a> and S1 Fig), with 46.6-90.1% nt identities between clusters and 95.1-100% within clusters. Of these 44 PyVs clusters, 42 showed exclusive host specificity within a single bat species while, surprisingly, the remaining 2 clusters included viruses detected in two bat species within different families (
      <em>Rh. affinis</em> and 
      <em>Hipposideros larvatus; Rh. affinis</em> and 
      <em>Myotis horsfieldii</em>, respectively). This finding provided preliminary evidence of inter-family transmission of PyVs (
      <a id="xref-fig-2-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F2">Fig 2</a> and S1 Fig). The majority (n= 191) of these partial VP1 shared less than 90% nt identity with the closest known PyVs. Interestingly, one VP1 sequence (marked by cluster 10 in S1 Fig), named here as Pipistrellus pipistrellus polyomavirus XJPp02 (strain PyV10-YXAC25) shared 98% nt identity with Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus 1, previously identified in brown rats in Germany [

Early and late regions were separated by a non-coding control region harboring regulatory elements. For all samples from which PyVs genomes were obtained, a ∼1,800 bp fragment of the

Of these novel bat-borne PyVs, 26 were identified in a single bat species, indicative of a high degree of host specificity. They included one PyV identified in a cryptic bat species (provisionally named 
      <em>Rhinolophus sp. CN2016</em>) the permanent identification of which awaits formal binomial classification of the host species as the

The PyVs named in the present study were based on the binomial names of their host bat species and the chronological order of discovery, as per ICTV guidelines. For example, Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 was the first PyV discovered in 
      <em>Aselliscus stoliczkanus</em> bats, and Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2 was the second PyV discovered in 
      <em>Rh. affinis</em> bats. Interestingly, two remaining PyVs were identified in more than one bat species. In detail, a PyV, herein provisionally named as Rhinolophus affinis-Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus (Ra-Hl PyV), was identified in both 
      <em>Rh. affinis</em> and 
      <em>H. larvatus</em> bats. Similarly, another PyV named as Rhinolophus affinis-Myotis horsfieldii polyomavirus (Ra-Mh PyV) was identified in 
      <em>Rh. affinis</em> and 
      <em>My. horsfieldii</em> bats. For clarity and according to the naming tradition of PyV, the Ra-Hl PyV identified in 
      <em>Rh. affinis</em> was named Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 5 (the fifth PyV discovered in

CN 2016 polyomavirus 1 shared 85% identity (Alpha 6); Rhinolophus ferrumequinum polyomavirus 2 shared 89% identity with Rhinolophus simulator polyomavirus 1 (LC269978) previously identified in Zambian bats (Alpha 7); and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum polyomavirus 1 shared 90% identity with Rhinolophus simulator polyomavirus 3 (LC269980) also identified in Zambian bats (Alpha 6). These last two instances showed that PyVs from Chinese and African horseshoe bats were remarkably similar despite the geographical separation.

      <a id="xref-table-wrap-3-1" class="xref-table" href="#T3">Table 3</a>, correlation analysis was performed using three groups of data: 1) a total of 42 PyVs with full genomes from the present study; 2) a total of 48 PyVs including the 42 PyV genomes described here and 6 PyV genomes we previously identified in Zambian horseshoe bats [
      <a id="xref-ref-26-4" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>]; 3) a total of 37 PyVs obtained by removing 11 PyVs (marked in 
      <a id="xref-fig-4-8" class="xref-fig" href="#F4">Fig 4</a> which potentially arose by host-switching events) from the 48 PyVs identified in both China and Zambia. Analysis of each of these three groups of data showed that there was negligible correlation between geographical distances and divergence for either hosts or viruses. Moreover, the geographical proximity between the colonies had little effect on the co-evolution of viruses with their respective hosts.

     <h3>Bayesian estimation of tMRCA of bat hosts and PyVs</h3>
     <p id="p-28">To test whether the host-switching events of the PyV species occurred after the divergence of host species, the times to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of both bat hosts and the PyVs were estimated employing a Bayesian approach. As shown in 
      <a id="xref-fig-5-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">Fig 5A</a>, the tMRCA of bat hosts were estimated based on the 
      <em>cytb</em> sequences (∼1800 bp) of bats that harbored the 28 novel PyVs. The results showed that divergence among 
      <em>Rhinolophus</em> species happened 14.2 to 17.3 million years ago (MYA) with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD), which is consistent with previously reported divergence times (16–17 MYA) of the bat hosts based on mitochondrial DNA [
      <a id="xref-ref-39-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-39">39</a>] and other sampled bat families [
      <a id="xref-ref-40-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-40">40</a>]. The Bayesian results for PyV divergence times (
      <a id="xref-fig-5-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">Fig 5B</a>) also showed that the tMRCAs for both 
      <em>Alpha</em>- and 
      <em>Betapolyomavirus</em> genera were 115-182 MYA with 95% HPD, overlapping with the divergence times of the tMRCA of placental mammals (92 to 116 MYA) [
      <a id="xref-ref-41-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-41">41</a>]. However, when compared with the Bayesian results for the bat hosts, the time scale of PyV divergence was not always in agreement: specifically, 1) the divergence time between 
      <em>Rhinolophus</em> and 
      <em>Hipposideros</em> hosts was estimated with a median 36.3 MYA in the 95% HPD range (34, 38) MYA, while the tMRCAs of Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 5 and Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1 were estimated with a median of 0.02 MYA in the 95% HPD range (0.0012, 0.12) MYA; 2) The tMRCAs of Myotis horsefieldii polyomavirus 3 and Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3 had a median of 1.05 MYA in the 95% HPD range (0.4, 1.9) MYA, while the median tMRCA of both corresponding host species was 66.76 MYA in the 95% HPD range (60.9, 73.5) MYA; 3) The median tMRCA of Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2 and Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 was estimated as 11.61 MYA in the 95% HPD range (6.6, 17.8) MYA, however, the tMRCA between both hosts had a median of 36.3 MYA in the 95% HPD range (34.3, 38.2) MYA. Finally, 4) the estimated time of divergence between Scotophillus kuhlii polyomavirus 2 and Pipistrellus pipistrellus polyomavirus 1, with a median of 37 MYA in the 95% HPD range (23, 54) MYA, was less than the predicted divergence time between the hosts, with a median of 44.42 MYA in the 95% HPD range (40, 49) MYA. In the four examples, the most parsimonious explanation for the lesser median ages to divergence of the PyVs compared to the longer tMRCAs for the bat hosts is that these represent examples of inter-family viral host-switching events.

     <h3>Intra-lineage host duplication and host-switching events during bat PyV evolution</h3>
     <p id="p-30">The findings of the Mantel test and other studies [
      <a id="xref-ref-17-6" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a>] supporting intra-host divergence for PyVs, required reconciliation with the compelling evidence of similar viral species infecting evolutionarily distant bat species. Co-phylogenetic reconstruction analyses using JANE 4 were therefore performed separately for both viral genera. The best-supported solution to explain the divergence in the genus 
      <em>Alphapolyomavirus</em> for the novel Chinese PyVs and African samples was modeled with 11 co-speciations, 4 lineage duplications, 13 lineage losses and 9 host-switching events (
      <a id="xref-fig-6-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F6">Fig 6A</a>). Among the 9 inferred host-switching events, in agreement with the tMRCA estimations, it was implied that Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 5 originated in the lineage which gave rise to Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1, Rhinolophus sinicus polyomavirus 1 and 2, and Scotophilus kuhli polyomavirus 2 indicating that Rh-Hl PyV was originally a PyV harbored by 
      <em>Rh. affinis</em>, which was subsequently transmitted to 
      <em>H. larvatus</em>. The best-supported solution also suggested that the lineage of Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2 had given rise to Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1. Other host-switching events inferred earlier in the divergence among PyVs were more difficult to corroborate with the available tMRCA data. Divergence in the genus 
      <em>Betapolyomavirus</em> involved 6 co-speciations, 2 lineage duplications, 7 lineage losses and 7 host-switching events (
      <a id="xref-fig-6-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F6">Fig 6B</a>). Similar to the 
      <em>Alphapolyomavirus</em> genus, the solution for the 
      <em>Betapolyomavirus</em> genus suggested, among the 7 host-switching events, that the origin of Myotis horsfieldii polyomavirus 3 was as a descendant of the lineage giving rise to Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3 (i.e. that Rh-Mh PyV was originally a PyV harbored by 
      <em>Rh. affinis</em> and transmitted to 
      <em>My. horsfieldii</em>), in agreement with the tMRCA results. In both solutions, although the presence of duplication events could explain the existence of more than one different viral species in the same host species, in multiple instances the dissimilarity between viral species from the same host species was more easily explained by host-switching events following the divergence between host species.

     <p id="p-32">Given the diversity of viral species identified in the genus 
      <em>Rhinolophus</em>, viral proteins under positive selection during the evolution of the different PyV lineages were of interest as possible speciation determinants. We performed a Bayesian analysis to calculate the ω rate (dN/dS) to identify genomic regions of the 
      <em>Alpha</em>- and 
      <em>Betapolyomavirus</em> genera in 
      <em>Rhinolophus</em> PyV clusters, which were likely subject to positive selection (S3 Fig). As expected, the majority of the horseshoe bat PyV genomes were found to be under neutral or negative selection (ω values ≤ 1); however, a number of residues in VP2, VP1, LTAg and STAg proteins did show evidence of positive selection (ω values &gt;; 1) in both viral genera (shown in red in S3 Fig) and amino acid residues relative to human BK virus (species of 
      <em>Human polyomavirus 1</em>) and simian virus 40 (species of 
      <em>Macaca mulatta polyomavirus 1</em>) are detailed in S5 Table. We focused on the major capsid protein VP1 as this determines antigenicity and the engagement of sialylated glycans present on host glycoproteins and glycolipids during cellular attachment and entry in mammalian (murine, human and monkey) viruses [

     <p id="p-33">In the 
      <em>Rhinolophus</em> alphapolyomavirus cluster, 11 residues were found under positive selection, located in four regions of VP1 (S5 Table): in the BC-loop (D77, N79 and V82), the DE-loop (L135, A139 and T143), the HI loop (N274, N275 and S279) and the C-terminal residues I367 and N369. In the

    <h2 class="">Discussion</h2>
    <p id="p-34">While mammalian PyVs are highly host specific [
     <a id="xref-ref-12-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12">12</a>] there are data suggesting cross-species jumps of PyVs between closely related mammalian hosts. Previously, short-range intra-genus host-switching events of PyVs were identified in African horseshoe bats, occurring between 
     <em>Rh. simulator</em> and 
     <em>Rh. blasii</em> in a single Zambian cave [
     <a id="xref-ref-26-6" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>]. Strikingly, the genomes of PyVs characterized in respective bat species were 99.9% identical and contained only four virus species-specific polymorphisms. Importantly, these polymorphisms were found to be present in both spleen and kidney samples of each bat host species, indicating a systemic and productive infection. The genetic stability and restricted host-specificity of mammalian PyVs had previously suggested a model of strict codivergence for PyV evolution [
     <a id="xref-ref-47-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-47">47</a>]. However, this is inconsistent with family-wide patterns of diversity, where an important contribution of intra-host lineage duplication, recombination and, possibly, host-switching events is evident. A model of intra-host divergence, with these additional evolutionary processes, occurring over the ancient timescales for association of PyVs with multicellular life, has been proposed to explain the extant diversity within the family 
     <em>Polyomaviridae</em> [
     <a id="xref-ref-17-7" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a>]. The findings in the present study extend these observations to PyVs in Chinese horseshoe bats and other bat hosts (see model in 
     <a id="xref-fig-7-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F7">Fig 7</a>) and provide the first definitive evidence of inter-family host-switching of PyVs in mammals occurring among the bat families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae and Vespertilionidae.

    <p id="p-36">The host-switching events of PyVs identified in the present study indicate that transmission of PyVs between different bat species has been an ongoing process during the evolutionary history of PyVs. HS1 and HS2 occurred between bats of different families and strains of PyVs sharing 100% or 97-100% nt identity were characterized in their respective hosts. The tMRCA analysis estimated that HS1 and HS2 occurred between 0.02-1.05 MYA. Considering the “slow” evolutionary rate of PyVs (8 × 10
     <sup>-9</sup> substitutions per site per year as previously estimated [
     <a id="xref-ref-48-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-48">48</a>]), the transmission events of Rh-Hl PyV and Rh-Mh PyV in bats happened recently, with a small number of mutations accumulating in the viral genomes during viral adaptation to the permissive hosts. Compared with HS1 and HS2, HS3 was estimated to have occurred much earlier, between 6.6-17.8 MYA, with the Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 showing 87% nt identity with the closest PyV (Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2), indicating that the former had been transmitted from Rhinolophus bats to A. stoliczkanus bats for a long period of time, had co-evolved with A. stoliczkanus and, finally, had formed a novel PyV species. In addition to these observed host switching events, the tMRCA estimation and correlation analysis showed strikingly that numerous PyVs had also been derived from host switching, thereby shaping the evolutionary history of PyVs and providing evidence that inter-species transmission of PyVs, at least in bats, is not as rare as previously thought.
    </p>
    <p id="p-37">An issue raised by the present study is how to define and name a PyV species when inter-family host-switching events of PyV are identified. The ICTV criteria for the formal designation of PyV species in mammals must include the binomial name of the host species [
     <a id="xref-ref-36-5" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-36">36</a>]; nevertheless, the inter-family host-switching events of PyVs discovered in the present study as well as the inter-species host-switching event also identified in 
     <em>Rhinolophus</em> hosts in a previous study [
     <a id="xref-ref-26-7" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>] which has challenged this nomenclature system for bat PyVs. Furthermore, numerous host-switching lineages have also been characterized here by correlation analyses and dating estimation. All these findings suggest that host-switching of PyVs has occurred not only in different bat species but also at different time points in different geographical locations. The ICTV nomenclature criteria should therefore be updated to include recognition of PyVs derived from two different mammalian host species.
    </p>
    <p id="p-38">Inter-species transmission has already been observed in bird PyVs such as budgerigar fledgling disease PyV (BFDV), which can infect multiple avian species with pronounced pathogenicity [
     <a id="xref-ref-49-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-49">49</a>]. Nevertheless, the ICTV nomenclature has utilized only the order level of the host species in the naming scheme: for instance, species belonging to BFDV have been classified as 
     <em>Aves polyomavirus 1</em>. This naming scheme could also be expanded using the more descriptive host species, as with the mammalian PyV species. So far, PyVs with host-switching events have only involved two host species, illustrating the limited ability of PyVs for transmission between different mammalian hosts. Therefore, the improved naming scheme of novel PyVs with host-switching events proposed here would include the binomial names of both host species; e.g., Rhinolophus affinis-Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus (Rh-Hl PyV), identified in the present study, would become the prototype of a new species named 
     <em>Rhinolophus affinis-Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1</em>.
    </p>
    <p id="p-39">Another ICTV criterion is the allowable genetic distance of the LTAg coding sequence (≥ 15%) to demarcate PyV species. This cut-off value is not strict, as exemplified by two PyVs identified in two different species of squirrel monkeys which shared 89% sequence identity but were recognized as two separated PyV species [
     <a id="xref-ref-36-6" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-36">36</a>]. In the present study, we have discovered numerous novel PyVs carried by diverse bat species, all exhibiting 86-90% sequence identities with their closest known species or with each other. These should be considered new PyV species since all were detected exclusively in distinct bat species in different areas and exhibiting strict host specificity. Examples include the PyVs identified in different 
     <em>Rhinolophus</em> bat species from China and Africa sharing 89-90% nt identify. The correlation and genetic selection analysis reported here has shown that the high sequence identity of different PyVs carried by different host species was due to the co-divergence with strong negative selection of PyVs in respective hosts, indicating that the ≥ 15% cut-off in LTAg gene identity for species demarcation is perhaps no longer adequate and should be updated to ≥10%. With regard to the relationship between Chinese and African bat PyVs referred to above, it is of interest to note that hepadnaviruses (pararetroviruses with DNA genomes) identified in Chinese 
     <em>Rhinolophus</em> bats in another study [
     <a id="xref-ref-49-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-49">49</a>] were also found to exhibit the closest genetic relation (79.6–79.7% nt identify) with viruses carried by African 
     <em>Rhinolophus</em> bats, [
     <a id="xref-ref-50-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-50">50</a>] thereby suggesting that co-divergence of DNA viruses within their 
     <em>Rhinolophus</em> bat hosts is relatively common.
    </p>
    <p id="p-40">In the present study we have identified 28 novel PyVs from 15 bat species in 6 families [
     <a id="xref-ref-36-7" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-36">36</a>], a finding that has considerably increased our knowledge of both the genomic diversity and the evolution of PyVs. Additionally, since there is a dearth of commercially available, standardized bat cell lines for isolation and identification of bat-borne viruses there are now added options to establish immortalized bat cell lines from many bat species by using LTAg genes cloned from divergent PyVs identified in specific Chinese bat species. At present, the Tb1 Lu cell line derived from the free-tailed bat (
     <em>Tardarida brasiliensis</em>, family Molossidae) is currently the only bat cell line available in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Nr. CCL-88) [
     <a id="xref-ref-51-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-51">51</a>]. Recently, however, Banerjee 
     <em>et al</em>. [
     <a id="xref-ref-52-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-52">52</a>] have reported immortalization of primary bat kidney cell lines from the big brown bat (
     <em>Eptesicus fuscus</em>, family Vespertilionidae) which were stably transformed by a plasmid harboring a little brown bat (
     <em>Myotis lucifugus</em>, family Vespertilionidae) PyV LTAg. The ability to establish cell lines from different tissues of diverse bat species and to make these available to researchers is a prerequisite for replication studies, virus-host interactions and new virus discoveries.
    </p>
    <p id="p-41">Papillomaviruses (PVs), which are closely related to PyVs and share similar properties such as, high genetic stability and strict host specificity, have been shown to cause transient and potentially cross-species infections. García-Pérez 
     <em>et al</em>. [
     <a id="xref-ref-53-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-53">53</a>] reported that PVs do not follow strict host restrictions in free-ranging Iberian bats (
     <em>Eptesicus serotinus</em>, family Vespertilionidae), as they found evidence of host-switching events between two different bat species (
     <em>E. serotinus</em> and 
     <em>E. isabellinus</em>). They therefore recommended a revised paradigm of strict host specificity in PVs [
     <a id="xref-ref-53-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-53">53</a>].
    </p>
    <p id="p-42">The findings presented here have possible implications for the study of zoonotic transmissions involving highly virulent viral pathogens in bats. For example, horseshoe bats within the family Rhinolophidae have been found to harbor genetically diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like corona viruses, which acted as major reservoirs for spillover of SARS coronavirus to humans [
     <a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>]. The Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has similarly been associated with severe disease and lethal respiratory infections, mostly in Saudi Arabia. Likely transmitted via dromedary camels, it has been shown to be closely related to several bat coronaviruses, including those sequenced from species within the family Vespertilionidae (
     <em>Neoromicia capensis, Pipistrellus abramus and Vespertilios uperans</em>) [
     <a id="xref-ref-54-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-54">54</a>]. Recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) coronavirus has been associated with high morbidity and mortality in pig populations in Guangdong province, China in close proximity to the origin of the SARS pandemic, and striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, ecological and etiological settings exist [
     <a id="xref-ref-9-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>]. We consider noteworthy that in the present study we identified host-switching events of the normally highly host-restricted PyVs within the bat families Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. Whether this reflects a greater propensity for host-switching in these bat families when compared with others and what mechanisms are involved require further functional studies. Conceivably, given the high prevalence we and others have detected of bat PyVs, co-infection of bat species within the families Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae may affect the prevalence and/or transmission of CoVs and other high virulent pathogens in bats. This suggestion warrants further study.
    </p>
    <p id="p-43">Our findings that inter-family transmission of PyVs can occur in mammals may also have implications for studies of viral oncogenesis proposed previously for the 
     <em>Polyomaviridae</em>. For example, three bovine PyVs (BoPyVs) have been identified in cattle [
     <a id="xref-ref-55-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-55">55</a>] with more likely given the 13 so far identified as infectious agents in humans [
     <a id="xref-ref-56-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-56">56</a>]. Intriguingly, BoPyV2, occupies the same clade as Merkel cell PyV which is causally implicated in oncogenic transformation in a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the elderly. BoPyV3, is also related to human polyomavirus 6 which has been reported in non-melanoma skin cancers, specifically keratocanthomas [
     <a id="xref-ref-57-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-57">57</a>]. Colorectal cancer has been suggested to have an infectious disease etiology [
     <a id="xref-ref-58-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-58">58</a>] and the relatively high thermoresistance of PyVs may preclude inactivation by lowered cooking temperatures [
     <a id="xref-ref-59-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-59">59</a>]. Similarly, in field studies, sequences of BK virus were identified by metagenomics in the feces of non-human primates [
     <a id="xref-ref-60-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-60">60</a>]. Our evidence that inter-family transmission of PyVs can occur in bats provides a precedent for studies of longer-range transmission of PyVs in mammals.
    </p>
    <p id="p-44">In addition to three bat inter-family host-switching events of PyVs, we also identified a partial VP1 fragment in rectal tissue of a 
     <em>P. pipistrellus</em> bat collected in northwestern Xinjiang that showed 98% nt identity with the VP1 of a previously described Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus 1 identified in Germany [
     <a id="xref-ref-35-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-35">35</a>]. Further qPCR assay also detected the virus in lung tissue of another 
     <em>P. pipistrellus</em> bat but not from any brown rat (n=51) collected in the same Xinjiang area. This preliminary observation provides an impetus to investigate potential PyV host-switching between mammal species beyond families.
    </p>
    <p id="p-45">The host-switching events identified in this study were strongly associated with the ecological environment of the hosts, with host-switching only identified between different bat species in one to two colonies. Our study suggests that PyVs can transmit between different mammalian hosts between two different animal families by frequent contact of hosts within specific environments, such as the densely packed bat populations that occur in large hibernacula in caves. The host-switching PyVs were identified from rectal tissues of multiple individuals, indicating that shedding via feces is a key factor for viral transmission by the fecal-oral route between different host species.</p>
    <p id="p-46">PyV attachment to target cells is mediated by cell surface receptors. MHC class I acts as a co-receptor and SV40 employs the ganglioside GM1 as receptor [
     <a id="xref-ref-61-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-61">61</a>]. The finding that gangliosides are also primary receptors for human PyVs via VP1 [
     <a id="xref-ref-62-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-62">62</a>] suggests that this may be a general property for primate PyVs although whether this is applicable to other mammalian PyVs, including bats, is unknown. In the present study, amino acid residues in VP1 were found to be under positive selection in 
     <em>Rhinolophus</em> PyVs in the BC, DE and HI loops (
     <em>Alphapolyomavirus</em>) and in the BC, DE and EF loops (
     <em>Betapolyomavirus</em>). Interestingly, both 
     <em>Rhinolophus</em> PyV genera showed evidence of positive selection in the external surface BC and DE loops. In BK virus, serological subtypes are assigned based on mutations present within the BC loop [
     <a id="xref-ref-63-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-63">63</a>]. It has also been previously demonstrated that sialylated glycans can act as primary receptors for PyVs [
     <a id="xref-ref-64-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-64">64</a>] and binding to sialic acid moieties was attributed to amino acids residues within the BC, DE and HI loops, suggesting that these VP1 domains play a key role in virus attachment and cellular entry events [
     <a id="xref-ref-45-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-45">45</a>]. The surface loops of VP1, i.e. the BC, DE, HI and EF loops, are responsible for viral antigenicity and escape mutants cluster in these regions, suggesting they represent conformational epitopes recognized by host neutralizing antibodies [
     <a id="xref-ref-65-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-65">65</a>, 
     <a id="xref-ref-66-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-66">66</a>]. VP1 surface loops form a unique virus-host interaction conformation that determines the host range, cellular tropism and pathogenicity which may explain the enrichment of positive selected residues within these regions [
     <a id="xref-ref-67-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-67">67</a>]. The availability of annotated bat genomes in the future, as proposed by the genome consortium Bat1K [
     <a id="xref-ref-68-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-68">68</a>], and annotation of the genes encoding putative entry receptors (such as, for example, the cell surface ganglioside and other sialylated glycan receptors) from within the bat families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae and Vespertilionidae from species previously found to harbor identical or closely related viruses would facilitate the functional characterization of the cellular receptors/attachment factors and of which amino acid residues in VP1 are required for binding and entry. Availability of annotated bat genomes would also help determine whether certain families of bats are more susceptible than others to virus-host switching events.

      <a id="xref-ref-34-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-34">34</a>]. Due to the complexity of the PyV-related reads detected by the viral metagenomic analyses, the PyV-specific nested PCR protocol [

     </p>
     <p id="p-50">Genomic DNA from each bat tissue sample was extracted manually using the TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (Tiangen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

      <em>Rhinolophus</em> in 
      <em>Alpha-</em> and 
      <em>Betapolyomavirus</em> genera

     <em>Rhinolophus</em> PyVs in both 
     <em>Alpha-</em> and 
     <em>Betapolyomavirus</em> genera with positions adjusted to Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 1 [PyVB-FN04C] and Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3 [PyV19-SWAC9], respectively. Tridimensional models for the VP1 proteins corresponding to both genera were inferred by structure homology modelling. The top and bottom views of both modelled proteins are shown in gray with sites under positive selection colored in red.
