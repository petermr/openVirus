<meta name="DC.Description" content="Due to its economic importance to in poultry industry, the biology and pathogenesis of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been investigated extensively. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in IBV entry are not well characterized. In this study, systematic approaches were used to dissect IBV entry process in various susceptible cells. First, we observed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV attachment. Second, low pH in intracyplasmic vesicles was required for virus entry. By using the specific clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitor or knock down of clathrin heavy chain (CHC), we demonstrated that IBV mainly utilized the CME for its entry. Furthermore, GTPase dynamin1 was involved in virus containing vesicle scission and internalization. Surprisingly, CME adaptor Eps15 had no effect on IBV internalization. Third, the penetration of IBV into cells led to active cytoskeleton rearrangement. After internalization, virus particles moved along with the classical endosome/lysosome track, as evidenced by co-localization of R18 labeled IBV with vehicle markers Rab5/Rab7/LAMP1 along with the infection time course. Functional inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection. VCP, a protein helps early endosome maturation, was involved virus trafficking. Finally, by using the dual R18/DiOC labeled IBV, we observed that membrane fusion with late endosome/lysosome membranes was induced between 2-3 h.p.i.. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that IBV virions attach to lipid rafts and are internalized into cells via CME, move along with early/late endosomes-lysosomes, finally fuse with late endosome-lysosome membranes, release virus genome into cytoplasm. This study provides comprehensive images of IBV attachment-internalization-trafficking-fusion steps.

IMPORTANCE IBV, the avian coronavirus isolated in 1937, infects chicken and causes economic loss in poultry industry. It has been reported that the entry of IBV requires low pH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IBV internalization and trafficking remain to be clarified. Therefore, we employed multiple chemical and molecular approaches to dissect the entry mechanisms of IBV in susceptible cells. Our results showed IBV entry was significantly inhibited when clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) was blocked by chemical inhibitor or depletion of clathrin protein. Moreover, by using R18-labeled IBV, we found that IBV particles attached to lipid rafts, led to actin rearrangement, and moved along with the entire endosomal system. R18/DiOC labeling method showed that IBV fused with late endosomes or lysosomes. This is the first report to describe the entire entry process of IBV, allowing for a better understanding of the infection process of group III avian coronavirus." />

<meta name="twitter:description" content="Due to its economic importance to in poultry industry, the biology and pathogenesis of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been investigated extensively. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in IBV entry are not well characterized. In this study, systematic approaches were used to dissect IBV entry process in various susceptible cells. First, we observed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV attachment. Second, low pH in intracyplasmic vesicles was required for virus entry. By using the specific clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitor or knock down of clathrin heavy chain (CHC), we demonstrated that IBV mainly utilized the CME for its entry. Furthermore, GTPase dynamin1 was involved in virus containing vesicle scission and internalization. Surprisingly, CME adaptor Eps15 had no effect on IBV internalization. Third, the penetration of IBV into cells led to active cytoskeleton rearrangement. After internalization, virus particles moved along with the classical endosome/lysosome track, as evidenced by co-localization of R18 labeled IBV with vehicle markers Rab5/Rab7/LAMP1 along with the infection time course. Functional inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection. VCP, a protein helps early endosome maturation, was involved virus trafficking. Finally, by using the dual R18/DiOC labeled IBV, we observed that membrane fusion with late endosome/lysosome membranes was induced between 2-3 h.p.i.. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that IBV virions attach to lipid rafts and are internalized into cells via CME, move along with early/late endosomes-lysosomes, finally fuse with late endosome-lysosome membranes, release virus genome into cytoplasm. This study provides comprehensive images of IBV attachment-internalization-trafficking-fusion steps.

IMPORTANCE IBV, the avian coronavirus isolated in 1937, infects chicken and causes economic loss in poultry industry. It has been reported that the entry of IBV requires low pH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IBV internalization and trafficking remain to be clarified. Therefore, we employed multiple chemical and molecular approaches to dissect the entry mechanisms of IBV in susceptible cells. Our results showed IBV entry was significantly inhibited when clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) was blocked by chemical inhibitor or depletion of clathrin protein. Moreover, by using R18-labeled IBV, we found that IBV particles attached to lipid rafts, led to actin rearrangement, and moved along with the entire endosomal system. R18/DiOC labeling method showed that IBV fused with late endosomes or lysosomes. This is the first report to describe the entire entry process of IBV, allowing for a better understanding of the infection process of group III avian coronavirus." />

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in IBV entry are not well characterized. In this study, systematic approaches were used to dissect IBV entry process in various susceptible cells. First, we observed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV attachment. Second, low pH in intracyplasmic vesicles was required for virus entry. By using the specific clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitor or knock down of clathrin heavy chain (CHC), we demonstrated that IBV mainly utilized the CME for its entry. Furthermore, GTPase dynamin1 was involved in virus containing vesicle scission and internalization. Surprisingly, CME adaptor Eps15 had no effect on IBV internalization. Third, the penetration of IBV into cells led to active cytoskeleton rearrangement. After internalization, virus particles moved along with the classical endosome/lysosome track, as evidenced by co-localization of R18 labeled IBV with vehicle markers Rab5/Rab7/LAMP1 along with the infection time course. Functional inactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 significantly inhibited IBV infection. VCP, a protein helps early endosome maturation, was involved virus trafficking. Finally, by using the dual R18/DiOC labeled IBV, we observed that membrane fusion with late endosome/lysosome membranes was induced between 2-3 h.p.i.. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that IBV virions attach to lipid rafts and are internalized into cells via CME, move along with early/late endosomes-lysosomes, finally fuse with late endosome-lysosome membranes, release virus genome into cytoplasm. This study provides comprehensive images of IBV attachment-internalization-trafficking-fusion steps.</p><div id="sec-1" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>IMPORTANCE</strong> IBV, the avian coronavirus isolated in 1937, infects chicken and causes economic loss in poultry industry. It has been reported that the entry of IBV requires low pH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IBV internalization and trafficking remain to be clarified. Therefore, we employed multiple chemical and molecular approaches to dissect the entry mechanisms of IBV in susceptible cells. Our results showed IBV entry was significantly inhibited when clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) was blocked by chemical inhibitor or depletion of clathrin protein. Moreover, by using R18-labeled IBV, we found that IBV particles attached to lipid rafts, led to actin rearrangement, and moved along with the entire endosomal system. R18/DiOC labeling method showed that IBV fused with late endosomes or lysosomes. This is the first report to describe the entire entry process of IBV, allowing for a better understanding of the infection process of group III avian coronavirus.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2 class="">INTRODUCTION</h2><p id="p-5">Most viruses take advantage of cellular endocytic pathways to enter their host cells (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>, <a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>). Once internalized, virus particles move through a dynamic network of endocytic vesicles, which undergoes gradual sorting and complex maturation events. Endosome maturation, in turn, triggers conformational changes and dissociation events in the incoming viruses, which ultimately lead to the delivery of the viral genome and associated proteins into the cytoplasm. In general, while non-enveloped viruses are able to penetrate the limiting endosomal membrane by lysis or pore formation (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>), enveloped viruses fuse with the vesicle membranes to release the genome into the cytoplasm (<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-4">4</a>). Different viruses employ different routes of endocytosis, and the route taken by a given virus largely depends on the receptor that the virus interacts with. Numerous virus families utilize endocytosis to infect host cells, mediating virus internalization as well as trafficking to the site of replication. The endocytic pathways utilized by viruses include clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), caveolin/raft-mediated endocytosis (CavME), macropinocytosis, and non-clathrin/non-caveolin mediated endocytosis. CME is the best understood endocytic pathway. In response to receptor mediated internalization signals, clathrin is recruited to plasma membrane, leading to the assembly of clathrin-coated pits (CCP) at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. The main scaffold component of clathrin coat is the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and clathrin light chain (CLC), forming a three-legged trimers called triskelions (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>). The adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) provides a bridge between receptor cargo domain and the clathrin β subunit (<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>). Once assembled, CCPs pinch off from the plasma membrane and mature into clathrin-coated vesicles (<a id="xref-ref-5-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>). During this process, the adaptors also play an important role, including Eps15 and dynamin GTPase. Lots of viruses use CME to enter cells, including Semliki forest virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>), hepatitis C virus, and Adenoviruses 2 and 5 (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>). The Caveolae is a relatively small vesicle with a diameter of 50 to 100 nm, which is a flask-shaped invasion formed by membrane retraction on the plasma membrane and is a specialized lipid raft domain composed of caveolin and high levels of cholesterol (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>, <a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>). CavME is first observed for the cellular uptake of simian virus 40 (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-11">11</a>). After that, other viruses including some of the picornaviruses (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12">12</a>), papillomaviruses (<a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13">13</a>), filoviruses (<a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14">14</a>), murine leukemia virus (<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-15">15</a>), and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (<a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16">16</a>) are found by utilizing CavME to enter into cells. Macropinocytosis is morphologically defined by the presence of membranous extensions of outwardly polymerizing actin termed membrane ruffles. It has been identified as an entry mechanism for several pathogens, including B2 adenovirus (<a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a>), Coxsackie B virus (<a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>), influenza A virus (<a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19">19</a>), Ebola virus (<a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20">20</a>), Vaccinia virus (<a id="xref-ref-21-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-21">21</a>), Nipah virus (<a id="xref-ref-22-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-22">22</a>), Kaposi’s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (<a id="xref-ref-23-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-23">23</a>), Newcastle disease virus (<a id="xref-ref-24-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-24">24</a>).</p><p id="p-6">Lipid rafts are functional membrane microdomains which are also termed detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes or detergent-resistant membranes, rich in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and proteins (<a id="xref-ref-25-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">25</a>, <a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>). They serve as domains to concentrate membrane-associated proteins that include receptors and signaling molecules (<a id="xref-ref-25-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-25">25</a>). In addition to physiological roles in signal transduction of host cells (<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a>), lipid rafts often serve as a site for entry, assembly and budding of microbial pathogens (<a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a>-<a id="xref-ref-30-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-30">30</a>). They are involved in the binding and entry of host cells for several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (<a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-31">31</a>), poliovirus (<a id="xref-ref-32-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-32">32</a>), human herpes virus 6 (<a id="xref-ref-33-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-33">33</a>), West Nile virus (<a id="xref-ref-34-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-34">34</a>), foot-and-mouth disease virus (<a id="xref-ref-35-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-35">35</a>), and dengue virus(<a id="xref-ref-36-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-36">36</a>). There is some evidence that lipid rafts are also involved in coronavirus entry. In the case of HCoV-229E, virus entry is inhibited by depletion of cholesterol, which results in the disruption of viral association with the cellular receptor CD13 (<a id="xref-ref-16-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16">16</a>). Thorp and Gallagher show that lipid rafts are crucial for the entry of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (<a id="xref-ref-37-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-37">37</a>). Guo et al., demonstrate that lipid rafts are involved in IBV entry (<a id="xref-ref-38-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-38">38</a>).</p><p id="p-7">Coronaviruses are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses belonging to the family <em>Coronaviridae</em>, which includes many human and animal pathogens of global concern, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), HCoV-229E, MHV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and IBV. In most cases, they cause respiratory and/or intestinal tract disease. In general, coronaviruses enter cells by endocytosis, which undergoes pH-dependent membrane fusion. For example, CME as well as clathrin- and caveolae-independent entry pathways have been reported for SARS-CoV (<a id="xref-ref-39-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-39">39</a>, <a id="xref-ref-40-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-40">40</a>); clathrin- and serine proteases-dependent uptake has been reported for PEDV (<a id="xref-ref-41-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-41">41</a>); FIPV is suggested to enter cells via a clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytic route (<a id="xref-ref-42-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-42">42</a>); and MHV2 enters cells via CME, but independent of Eps15 (<a id="xref-ref-43-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-43">43</a>). IBV belongs to the genus <em>gamma coronavirus</em>. Its genome is approximately 27.6 kilobases (kb) in length, encoding 2 polyproteins (1a, 1ab), four structural proteins, namely, spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), and small envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N); and four accessory proteins named 3a, 3b, 5a, 5b, are encoded by subgenomic RNA species. Polyprotein 1a and 1ab are cleaved by viral proteases into at least 15 non-structural proteins (nsp2-nsp16). The structural and accessory proteins are encoded by subgenomic RNA species. Despite the importance of IBV as one of the dominant pathogens causing a highly contagious infectious bronchitis worldwide and leading to significant economic loss in the chicken industry, little information is available about its entry mechanisms. It has been identified that the entry of IBV into cells depends on lipid rafts and low pH (<a id="xref-ref-44-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-44">44</a>); however, the endocytic pathway that IBV hijacks is unclear.</p><p id="p-8">The early step in the entry process of IBV into target cells is initiated by engagement of the S glycoprotein with the receptor. Here, using several cell lines permissive to IBV Beaudette strain, we report that IBV virion attaches to lipid rafts in the cell surface and the efficient entry of IBV into cells requires the presence of intact lipid rafts. We also address IBV entry pathway by systematically perturbing the function of key factors in the various endocytic mechanisms using chemical inhibitors, siRNA silence, and overexpression of dominant negative proteins. To achieve a successful tracking of virion attachment, entry, intracellular trafficking, and membrane fusion, octadecyl rhodamine (R18) and 3, 3′-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine Iodide (DiOC) were labeled on viral membrane as fluorescent tags. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to visualize the co-localization or co-trafficking of virus and cellular factors. Our results reveal that IBV is internalized into cells by CME, transports along early endosomes, late endosomes, and fuses with membrane at late endosome-lysosomes.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2 class="">MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><h3>Cells and viruses</h3><p id="p-9">Vero cells, Huh7 cells, BHK-21, and DF-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 4500 mg/l glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, USA), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, USA).

Whereas some work states that heparan sulfate is a selective attachment factor for the IBV Beaudette strain (<a id="xref-ref-48-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-48">48</a>), another report concludes that sialic acid is a receptor determinant of infection (<a id="xref-ref-49-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-49">49</a>). Since membrane cholesterol plays an important role in early infection stages, the interaction of IBV with its receptor may occur in lipid rafts. To test this hypothesis, Vero cells were incubated with IBV for 1 h at 4°C and lipid rafts were isolated by a sucrose flotation gradient. The individual fractions were analyzed for the presence of rafts marker flotillin-1, IBV N protein, and IBV S protein by Western blotting. In IBV-infected cells, we found that S protein and N protein were co-localized with the rafts marker flotillin-1in fractions 2 and 3 (<a id="xref-fig-3-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F3">Fig. 3A</a>).

This result confirms the association of IBV with lipid rafts on cell surface.</p></div><div id="sec-22" class="subsection"><h3>IBV entry is low pH dependent</h3><p id="p-37">Although previous study demonstrates that IBV strain Beaudette entry is sensitive to drug treatment that neutralize the low pH of endosomes in BHK cells (<a id="xref-ref-44-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-44">44</a>), it has also been shown that different cell types have different abilities to allow viral entry (<a id="xref-ref-50-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-50">50</a>). Thus, to dissect the IBV entry pathway, it is necessary to verify whether the low pH dependent entry of IBV is cell type specific. To this end, we increased the pH in Vero, BHK, H1299, and Huh7 cells by using endosome acidification inhibitor NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and checked IBV internalization/replication. To ensure subtoxic doses of the drug, Vero cells were treated with 0-160 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 30 min, and cytotoxic effects were evaluated by cell viability assay. As shown in <a id="xref-fig-4-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4A</a>, Vero cells tolerated the treatment of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl up to 100 mM. Next, acridine orange staining was performed to confirm increasing pH in intercellular vesicles caused by the drug treatment. Results in <a id="xref-fig-4-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4B</a> showed that untreated cells displayed typical orange fluorescence, indicative of acidic compartments. As expected, the orange fluorescence decreased along with increasing concentration of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment, and 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment totally quenched the orange fluorescence, confirming pH increased in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treated cells. To examine the functional role of a low pH on IBV infectivity, we pretreated various cell lines with 0-100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 30 min, followed by inoculation with IBV for 1 h at 4°C. The temperature was shifted to 37 °C for an additional 1 h to allow synchronized entry. Internalized virus was quantified by detection of viral gRNA at 2 h.p.i.. As shown in <a id="xref-fig-4-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4C, 4E, 4G</a>; 4I, virus internalization was significantly reduced by NH4Cl pretreatment in a dose-dependent manner, compared to those in H<sub>2</sub>O treated cells. The virus replication upon NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment was monitored by detection of viral N protein at 8 h.p.i.. The basic mechanism of pH-dependent endocytosis for VSV has been known for many years and is well documented (<a id="xref-ref-51-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-51">51</a>-<a id="xref-ref-54-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-54">54</a>). Thus, VSV infection of Vero cells was included in this experiment as a positive control. Western blot result in <a id="xref-fig-4-4" class="xref-fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4D</a> showed that VSV G protein expression was decreased by NH4Cl treatment in dose dependent manner, suggesting that this drug really inhibited VSV infection. Data in <a id="xref-fig-4-5" class="xref-fig" href="#F4">Fig. 4D, 4F, 4H, 4J</a> showed that IBV N protein production was significantly decreased by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment in dose dependent manner.

To identify the endocytic pathway employed by IBV, pharmacological inhibition, siRNA-mediated depletion, and overexpression of dominant negative or constitutive active proteins were carried out to block or strengthen respective endocytic pathway. First, we investigated the effect on IBV entry by diverse pharmacological drugs treatments which have been well known to inhibit CME, CavME, or macropinocytosis. Vero, H1299, and DF-1 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of Chlorpromazine (CPZ), an inhibitor of clathrin lattice polymerization (<a id="xref-ref-56-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-56">56</a>), Amiloride, a specific inhibitor of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger activity important for macropinosome formation(<a id="xref-ref-17-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a>, <a id="xref-ref-23-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-23">23</a>, <a id="xref-ref-57-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-57">57</a>, <a id="xref-ref-58-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-58">58</a>), or Nystatin, a CavME inhibitor (<a id="xref-ref-59-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-59">59</a>). Virus endocytosis was quantified by measuring the amount of intracellular viral gRNA at 2 h.p.i., and virus replication was scored by IBV N protein expression level at 8 h.p.i.. The toxicity of each inhibitor was carefully determined (data not shown). As semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR results shown in <a id="xref-fig-5-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5A, 5C</a>, and <a id="xref-fig-5-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">5E</a>, compared to the control group, pretreatment of cells with CME inhibitor CPZ strongly inhibited the internalization of viral gRNA in Vero, H1299, and DF-1 cells, which is dose dependent; however, Amiloride pretreatment did not significantly change the internalization of virus in all three cell lines. Nystatin pretreatment did not alter the virus internalization in either Vero or DF-1 cells; however, it slightly reduced the internalization in H1299 cells. Western blot detection of viral N protein expression in <a id="xref-fig-5-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5B, 5D</a>, and <a id="xref-fig-5-4" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">5F</a> showed that CPZ significantly inhibited the viral N protein expression in a dose dependent manner; Amiloride pretreatment did not significantly change the expression of N protein in all three cell lines. In Nystatin pretreated Vero cells, IBV N protein remained in a steady level, compared to control treated cells; however, in H1299 and DF-1 cells, Nystatin pretreatment slightly reduced the viral protein expression. It has been reported that VSV entry is mediated by CME, and indeed, CPZ pretreatment of Vero cells reduced the VSV G protein expression in a dose dependent manner, while Amiloride and Nystatin pretreatment had no effect (<a id="xref-fig-5-5" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5I</a>). Thus, these results reveal that IBV enters cells via CME, but not via macropinocytosis. Whether the CavME is involved in IBV endocytosis may be cell type dependent and is controversial. To explore the involvement of CavME in IBV entry, we utilized Huh7 cell, which lacks functional caveolae (<a id="xref-ref-15-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-15">15</a>, <a id="xref-ref-60-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-60">60</a>), to perform above experiment. As evidenced by high level of intracellular viral gRNA and N protein expression, efficient virus internalization and replication was observed in Huh7 cells (<a id="xref-fig-5-6" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5G-H</a>), demonstrating that IBV entry is independent of caveolae. Moreover, CPZ pretreatment significantly reduced IBV gRNA internalization and N protein expression in Huh7 cells, while neither Amiloride nor Nystatin reduced the internalization and replication (<a id="xref-fig-5-7" class="xref-fig" href="#F5">Fig. 5G-H</a>), consistent with those observed in other cell lines. Combining above results, we conclude that IBV entry is mediated by CME, and this is not restricted to cell types.</p><div id="F5" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/06/21/352898/F5/graphic-11.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="IBV entry is blocked by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) inhibitor CPZ.

Microinjection of Eps15 antibody interfered with transferring and EGFR internalization (<a id="xref-ref-61-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-61">61</a>), suggesting that Eps15 plays an important role in CME. Several reviews described previously that the expression of the C-terminal dominant negative form of Eps15-DN, which contains the AP2-binding site, could efficiently block the uptake of Sindbis virus (<a id="xref-ref-62-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-62">62</a>). Dynamin1 is a GTPase facilitating membrane fission to generate endocytic vesicles in CME and CavME (<a id="xref-ref-47-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-47">47</a>, <a id="xref-ref-63-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-63">63</a>, <a id="xref-ref-64-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-64">64</a>). Many reviews describe that dynamin1 is required for the internalization of various viruses, as the dynamin1-K44A, a dominant negative mutant demonstrated preciously to block virus entry (<a id="xref-ref-65-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-65">65</a>, <a id="xref-ref-66-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-66">66</a>). To examine the involvement of Eps15 and dynamin1 in IBV entry, we expressed pEGFPN1, GFP-tagged Eps15-WT, Eps15-DN, dynamin1-WT, and dynamin1-DN in H1299 cells, respectively, followed by IBV infection. pEGFPN1 was expressed as the control. Vero cells were not chosen for the protein expression experiment due to their low transfection efficiency. The successful expression of GFP, GFP-tagged Eps15-WT, GFP-Eps15-DN, dynamin1-WT, and dynamin1-DN was detected in <a id="xref-fig-6-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F6">Fig. 6A</a> (low panel), and the expression level of Eps15 is lower than dynamin1. Compared to that in GFP expressing cells, the expression of IBV N protein was increased in dynamin1-WT expressing cell, whereas reduced in dynamin1-DN expressing cells, demonstrating the crucial role of dynamin1 in IBV infection. Surprisingly, neither Eps15-WT nor Eps15-DN changed the expression level of IBV N, due to unknown reason. It has been reported that VSV entry relies on functional Eps15 (<a id="xref-ref-67-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-67">67</a>), thus, the effect of Eps15 on VSV entry of Vero cells was also examined as control experiment. Eps15-DN indeed inhibited VSV infectivity, as evidenced by the reduced level of VSV G protein (by 0.66-fold) in Eps15-DN expressing cells (<a id="xref-fig-6-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F6">Fig. 6D</a>). Therefore, the failure of blocking IBV infectivity by Eps15-DN is not due to low expression level of Eps15-DN or experimental error. To confirm above result, the internalization of IBV gRNA was quantified at 2 h.p.i.. As shown in <a id="xref-fig-6-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F6">Fig. 6B</a>, expression of dynamin1-DN significantly blocked virus internalization by 0.6-fold, whereas expression of dynamin1-WT, Eps15-WT, and Eps15-DN had no significant effect on virus entry. The release of progeny virus particle was also determined by TCID<sub>50</sub>. Results in <a id="xref-fig-6-4" class="xref-fig" href="#F6">Fig. 6C</a> showed that expression of dynamin1-DN significantly reduced progeny virus production by around 0.5-fold, but dynamin1-WT, Eps15-WT, and Eps15-DN had no significant effect on this, compared to those in GFP expressing cells. In all, above results suggest that IBV entry depends on functional dynamin1, but not Eps15.</p><div id="F6" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/06/21/352898/F6.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="IBV endocytosis is dependent on dynamin1.

The knock down efficiency of Eps15 or dynamin1 and intracellular IBV gRNA were measured by semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR. As shown in <a id="xref-fig-7-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F7">Fig. 7</a>, successful silence of Eps15 mRNA was obtained by siEps15 in both H1299 and Vero cells (<a id="xref-fig-7-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F7">Fig. 7A, C</a>); however, silence of Eps15 expression had no significant effect on the IBV gRNA internalization (<a id="xref-fig-7-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F7">Fig. 7B</a>).

To this purpose, cells were transfected with siRNA targeting CHC and then infected with IBV (H1299 cells) or VSV (Vero cells). As shown in <a id="xref-fig-7-7" class="xref-fig" href="#F7">Fig. 7H-J</a>, depletion of CHC was accompanied by a significant reduction of IBV gRNA internalization and IBV/VSV protein expression, which further demonstrates a functional clathrin pathway is required for efficient IBV infection.</p></div><div id="sec-25" class="subsection"><h3>IBV entry leads to active actin rearrangement</h3><p id="p-46">In <em>Saccharomyces cerevisae</em>, clathrin-coated patches on the cell surface mature into ~200 nm tubular invaginations with coat proteins at their tip. The actin cytoskeleton machinery is recruited after coat formation and provides an essential force for membrane deformation and internalization (<a id="xref-ref-69-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-69">69</a>). Recent studies have revealed that the rhabdoviruses (<a id="xref-ref-70-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-70">70</a>), VSV (<a id="xref-ref-7-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>), RABV (<a id="xref-ref-71-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-71">71</a>), and IHNV (<a id="xref-ref-72-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-72">72</a>) are internalized through CME and depend on actin. Although we have demonstrated that IBV enter cells by hijacking clathrin dependent route, it is unclear whether actin filaments are involved in IBV uptake. To examine the role of actin filaments in IBV entry, we first examined the actin polymerization during IBV internalization. Vero cells were incubated with IBV at 4°C for 1 h, and the temperature was shifted to 37°C. Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (green) and IBV N antibody at 15 min time interval and were observed by confocal microscopy. In mock-infected cells, the actin stress fibers were visible clearly. At 15 to 45 min.p.i., the number of actin stress fibers dramatically decreased, the cells rounded up, and cells surface displayed significant blebbing. The cell morphology and actin distribution returned to normal at 60 min.p.i. (<a id="xref-fig-8-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F8">Fig. 8A</a>). Above observation indicates that IBV infection results in transient actin de-polymerization and re-arrangement. IBV N protein antibody is not sensitive enough to detect the incoming virus. To check whether of IBV internalization associates with actin, R18-IBV was applied to Vero cell. Actin filaments were stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin at 15 min time interval, and the red signal of R18-IBV and green signal of actin were observed. As expected, images in <a id="xref-fig-8-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F8">Fig. 8B</a> showed that there was no R18 red signal in mock infection group. In the R18-IBV infection group, R18-IBV was detected at cell surface at 0 min, displayed as red signal. After attachment, R18-IBV entered cells and co-localized well with actin at 15, 30, and 45 min, shown as yellow signal. At 60 min, Most R18-IBV particles separated with actin, displayed as red signal again. This observation suggests that IBV enters cells via actin cytoskeleton. Here, we also incubated the well characterized R18-VSV with Vero cells as control group. As R18-VSV enters into cells quickly, we chose the time interval of 5 min. Image in Supplementary Fig. 2A showed that R18-VSV also caused actin fiber de-polymerization and cell rounded up at 5-30 min.p.i.. The cell morphology and actin distribution returned to normal at 30 min. Meanwhile, R18-VSV co-localized well with actin at 5, 10, 20, and 30 min, suggesting that VSV also moves along actin fiber after internalization, consistent with previous report (<a id="xref-ref-73-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-73">73</a>).</p><div id="F8" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/06/21/352898/F8/graphic-19.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="IBV entry causes actin rearrangement.

Vero cells were treated with jasplakinolide (Jas), an actin polymer-stabilizing drug (<a id="xref-ref-74-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-74">74</a>–<a id="xref-ref-76-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-76">76</a>), or with cytochalasm D (CytoD), which binds to the growing ends of actin filaments and prevents the polymerization (<a id="xref-ref-77-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-77">77</a>). Vero cells were pretreated with either Jas or CytoD in increasing concentrations before being infected with IBV. Cells were harvested at indicated time points to measure IBV gRNA internalization or N protein expression. <a id="xref-fig-8-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F8">Fig. 8C-D</a> showed that when actin polymers were stabilized by Jas, the IBV internalization and N protein expression were increased in a dose-dependent manner. <a id="xref-fig-8-4" class="xref-fig" href="#F8">Fig. 8E-F</a> showed that when CytoD prevented the formation of actin polymers, IBV internalization and N protein expression were also significantly increased. This observation is self-contradictory and out of expectation. Thus, we use the well characterized VSV as control to perform this experiment, ensuring the inhibitors work. When the Jas or CytoD was applied to Vero cells before VSV infection, both inhibitors reduced VSV G protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 2B, C), consistent with previous report of actin dependent entry of VSV (<a id="xref-ref-73-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-73">73</a>). These results imply that the inhibitors indeed interfere with actin polymerization or de-polymerization. The enhancement of IBV infection by these inhibitors is not the only case, it has been reported that SFV infection was also enhanced by CytoD pretreatment (<a id="xref-ref-78-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-78">78</a>). In all, above results demonstrate that the binding of IBV to cell surface causes actin de-polymerization and rearrangement, however, when the actin de-polymerization and rearrangement are interfered by inhibitors, the virus entry is enhanced. How do the inhibitors increase IBV entry? The underlying mechanisms are unclear.</p></div><div id="sec-26" class="subsection"><h3>IBV moves across the entire endo-lysosomal system</h3><p id="p-49">After identification of the endocytic pathway hijacked by IBV, we next tracked the transport vesicles utilized by incoming IBV. R18-IBV was incubated with Vero cells at 4°C for 1 h, allowing attachment. R18-mock infected cells were included as control. After removing the unbound virus by replacing with fresh DMEM, the temperature was shifted to 37°C to facilitate the synchronous endocytosis. Cells were subjected to immunostaining by using antibodies against early endosome marker Rab5, late endosome marker Rab7, and lysosome marker LAMP1. Rab5 and Rab7 are GTPases that are required for the movement of endocytosed cargo to early or late endosomes (<a id="xref-ref-79-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-79">79</a>, <a id="xref-ref-80-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-80">80</a>). The co-localization of R18-IBV and transport vesicles markers at 0-3 h.p.i. was observed under confocal microscope. As shown in <a id="xref-fig-9-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9A</a>, there was no red signal detected in R18-mock infected cells ( first panel); the overlapped signals of R18-IBV and early endosome marker Rab5 were mainly observed at 1 h.p.i. (yellow dots with white arrows in second panel); however, there was no co-image of R18-IBV with Rab5 at 2 h.p.i. and 3 h.p.i.(third and fourth panels). This reveals that IBV enters into early endosome at 1 h.p.i, and leaves early endosome at 2 and 3 h.p.i.. Moreover, the co-localization of virus particles and Rab7 was mainly observed at 2 h.p.i. (yellow dots with white arrow in third panel), there was no R18-IBV overlapped with late endosome marker Rab7 observed at 1 h.p.i. and 3 h.p.i., demonstrating that R18-IBV enters late endosome at 2 h.p.i.. Furthermore, R18-IBV was found in LAMP1 containing lysosomes at 3 h.p.i. (yellow dots with white arrow in fourth panel). Previous study showed that VSV was internalized into early endosome in a few minutes via CME (<a id="xref-ref-81-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-81">81</a>). Thus, we used R18-VSV to perform above experiment in Vero cells as control. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, R18-VSV co-localized well with early endosome marker Rab5 at 5, 10, and 20 min.p.i. (yellow dots with white arrows in second, third, and fourth panels). There was less co-image of R18-VSV with Rab5 at 30 min.p.i. (fifth panel), indicating the R18-VSV leaves early endosomes at this time point. Moreover, there was almost no co-image of R18-VSV with Rab7/LAMP1 at 0-30 min. These observations verify that VSV enters early endosome, but is not delivered into late endosome and lysosome, consistent with previous study (<a id="xref-ref-73-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-73">73</a>). In all, above results reveal that IBV enters early endosome at around 1 h.p.i., passes through late endosome at around 2 h.p.i., and reaches lysosome at 3 h.p.i..</p><div id="F9" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/06/21/352898/F9/graphic-22.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="The incoming R18-IBV transports along the entire endocytic pathway.

To achieve this, we took advantage of the fact that, in addition to providing organelle identity, Rab5 and Rab7 serve critical roles in regulation of cargo transport within the endosomal system (<a id="xref-ref-82-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-82">82</a>). Accordingly, dominant negative mutant of these proteins has been shown to block cargo transport (<a id="xref-ref-83-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-83">83</a>, <a id="xref-ref-84-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-84">84</a>). Expression of Rab5-DN prevents fusion of endocytic vesicles with early endosomes, while Rab7-DN prevents movement from early to late endosomes. H1299 cells were transfected with GFP, GFP fused Rabs-WT (Rab5-WT, Rab7-WT), Rabs-DN (GFP-Rab5-S34N, GFP-Rab7-T22N), or Rabs-CA (GFP-Rab5-Q79L, GFP-Rab7-Q67L), and then the cells were infected with IBV for 12 h. The cells were harvested for Western blot to check the expression of Rabs and IBV N protein. As shown in <a id="xref-fig-9-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9B</a>, all these proteins were successfully expressed. Compared with GFP expressing group, expression of Rab5-WT, Rab5-CA, Rab7-WT, and Rab7-CA has only minimal effect on the expression of IBV N, whereas expression of Rab5-DN and Rab7-DN caused significantly reduction (0.1-fold) in IBV infection (<a id="xref-fig-9-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9B</a>). These data reveal that IBV could not infect cells expressing Rab5-DN and Rab7-DN. Inhibition of IBV infection by Rab5-DN and Rab7-DN was highly significant, indicating that transport through the early and late endosome is necessary for IBV infection. To further verify above observation, we quantified the internalized IBV in Rabs expressing cells. Results in <a id="xref-fig-9-4" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9C</a> confirmed that expression of Rab5-DN and Rab7-DN decreased internalization of IBV gRNA by 0.6-fold. Moreover, expression of Rab7-CA slightly increased virus internalization. To ensure our Rabs construct was functional, we examine the effect of Rabs on VSV infection in Vero cells. As shown previously (<a id="xref-ref-73-4" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-73">73</a>), Rab5-DN, but not Rab7-DN, inhibited VSV infection (<a id="xref-fig-9-5" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9D</a>). Collectively, these data indicate that major IBV virions are delivered to early endosomes after CME, followed by transferring to late endosomes.</p><p id="p-52">Knock down of Rab5 or Rab7 was carried out to confirm above conclusion. H1299 cells were transfected with siRab5 or siRab7, followed with IBV infection. The knock down effect of Rabs and IBV N protein expression was examined by Western blot. <a id="xref-fig-9-6" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9E</a> and <a id="xref-fig-9-7" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">9H</a> showed that both Rab5 and Rab7 expression were successfully knocked down by RNA interference in H1299 cells, resulting lower expression of IBV N protein than that in sic tranfected cells. This demonstrates that the virus replication is decreased when the transport pathway is hampered by removing Rab5 or Rab7. Quantification of incoming virus genome also confirmed that depletion of Rab5 or Rab7 reduced virus genome internalization (<a id="xref-fig-9-8" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9 F</a> and I). To ensure siRabs was functional, we examine the effect of Rabs knock down on VSV infection in Vero cells. Western blot result showed that knock down of Rab5 reduced VSV G protein expression (<a id="xref-fig-9-9" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9G</a>), while knock down of Rab7 did not inhibit VSV infection (<a id="xref-fig-9-10" class="xref-fig" href="#F9">Fig. 9J</a>). Altogether, these data further confirm that after internalized by CME, both early and late endosomes are required for IBV transport.</p></div><div id="sec-27" class="subsection"><h3>IBV fuses with late endosomes or lysosomes</h3><p id="p-53">To understand the fusion of IBV envelope with cellular membranes, we labeled IBV virion with two fluorescent lipids, R18 (red) and DiOC (green), a labeling method developed by Sakai and coworkers (<a id="xref-ref-85-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-85">85</a>). The intact virus membrane displays the red color as the high concentration of R18 quenches the fluorescence signal emitted by the DiOC. When the virus membrane fuses with cellular membrane, the two lipids were diluted and the green fluorescence of DiOC was no longer quenched by R18, red and green color will be displayed respectively. The Vero cell culture supernatant was labeled with R18 and DiOC as mock infection sample. Vero cells were infected with R18/DiOC-IBV or with R18/DiOC-mock for 1, 2, 3 h, stained with Rab5, Rab7, LAMP1 antibodies, and observed under confocal microscope. As shown in <a id="xref-fig-10-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F10">Fig. 10</a>, in mock infection group, there was neither red signal nor green signal observed (first panel). When the R18/DiOC labeled virus was incubated with cells, only red color spots were observed at 1 and 2 h.p.i., no green signals were detected at these two time points (second and third panels). Moreover, most of the red spots were co-localized with early endosomes marker Rab5 at 1 h.p.i. (pink spots with white arrows in second panel), and transferred to Rab7 containing late endosomes or LAMP1 containing lysosomes at 2 h.p.i. (pink spots with white arrows in third panel). Gradually, green spots (membrane fusion signals) were observed and increased in numbers at 3 h.p.i. (white arrow in fourth panel), overlapped with either late endosome marker Rab7 or lysosome marker LAMP1 (white arrows in fourth panel), implying that IBV membranes undergo fusion with late endosome/lysosome membranes at 3 h.p.i. or between 2-3 h.p.i.. We also performed above fusion experiment by using well studied VSV labeled with R18/DiOC as control, which has been reported to fuse with early endosomes. As shown in Supplementary Fig.4, only red spots were observed at 10 min.p.i., overlapped with Rab5 (yellow spots with white arrows in second panel), without overlap with Rab7 or LAMP1. At 20 and 30 min.p.i., green spots were detected, co-localized with Rab5 (pink spots with white arrows in third and fourth panels), consistent with previous report (<a id="xref-ref-73-5" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-73">73</a>). In all, we demonstrate that IBV fuses with late endosome/lysosome at 2-3 h.p.i., and its intracellular trafficking is slower than VSV.</p><div id="F10" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/06/21/352898/F10.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="IBV fuses with late endosomes or lysosomes membranes.

Thus, maturation of endosome should provide the environmental cues required for productive virus-cell fusion. VCP is an abundant protein implicated in an increasing number of biological processes, including membrane fusion after mitosis (<a id="xref-ref-86-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-86">86</a>), retro-translocation of unfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (<a id="xref-ref-87-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-87">87</a>, <a id="xref-ref-88-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-88">88</a>), spindle assembly (<a id="xref-ref-89-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-89">89</a>), and endosome trafficking (<a id="xref-ref-90-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-90">90</a>, <a id="xref-ref-91-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-91">91</a>). Previous report shows that depletion of VCP results in an accumulation of virus particles in the early endosomal compartments, suggesting that VCP is required for the maturation of endosomes and efficient transfer of virus particles from the early to late endosomes (<a id="xref-ref-92-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-92">92</a>). To further access the role of VCP in IBV infection, we constructed GFP-tagged VCP and transiently expressed this protein in H1299 cells, followed with infection. The expression of GFP-VCP was confirmed by Western blot (<a id="xref-fig-11-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F11">Fig. 11A</a>). Compared with the GFP expressing control group, overexpression of GFP-VCP significantly increased the expression of IBV N by 1.45-fold (<a id="xref-fig-11-2" class="xref-fig" href="#F11">Fig. 11A</a>), however, the virus internalization was not increased (<a id="xref-fig-11-3" class="xref-fig" href="#F11">Fig. 11B</a>), indicating VCP plays a role post-internalization. The higher rate of viral gRNA replication associated with VCP expression was also detected with RT-PCR by using primers targeting to negative stranded gRNA (<a id="xref-fig-11-4" class="xref-fig" href="#F11">Fig. 11C</a>). Immunofluorescence in <a id="xref-fig-11-5" class="xref-fig" href="#F11">Fig.11D</a> showed that GFP-VCP was co-localized with Rab5 (yellow in second panel), instead of Rab7 or LAMP1, suggesting the role of VCP in early endosome maturation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that VCP is involved in transferring IBV from early endosomes to destination for efficient replication.</p><div id="F11" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/06/21/352898/F11/graphic-26.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="VCP is involved in IBV trafficking.

Thus, characterization of viral entry pathway is important for understanding of virus pathogenesis and design of anti-viral drugs. Envelope viruses penetrate cells by two different ways: fusion with cell plasma membrane or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Direct membrane fusion on the cell surface is independent of low pH, and access through the endocytosis pathway usually relies on the low pH of the endocytic vesicles. Different endocytosis pathways have been characterized over the past decade, in which the CME is one of the most commonly used by many envelope viruses (<a id="xref-ref-93-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-93">93</a>). Coronavirus entry is mediated by S protein, which is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion. Previously, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV is internalized by CME in human hepatoma HepG2 cell line (<a id="xref-ref-39-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-39">39</a>), however, in HEK293E-ACE2-GFP cells, the entry of SARS-CoV is clathrin- and caveolae-independent (<a id="xref-ref-40-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-40">40</a>); MHV entry is mediated by CME through the endo-/lysosomal pathway in proteolysis-dependent manner (<a id="xref-ref-43-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-43">43</a>, <a id="xref-ref-94-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-94">94</a>-<a id="xref-ref-97-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-97">97</a>); PHEV enters into cells via CME in Rab5, cholesterol, and low pH dependent manner (<a id="xref-ref-98-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-98">98</a>); HCoV-NL63 requires CME for successful entry into the LLC-MK2 cells (<a id="xref-ref-99-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-99">99</a>); for the HCoV-229E, a CavME uptake has been suggested (<a id="xref-ref-16-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-16">16</a>), however, the clinical isolates of HCoV-229E bypass the endosome for cell entry (<a id="xref-ref-100-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-100">100</a>). Above evidence demonstrates that coronavirus enter cells via multiple pathways. Thus, study on IBV entry mechanisms is necessary for understanding group 3 coronavirus infection process. As mentioned previously, the infectivity of IBV on BHK cells is inhibited by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl treatment (<a id="xref-ref-44-5" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-44">44</a>), demonstrating that IBV entry requires low pH triggered membrane fusion. In this study, we made an effort to systematically examine every step of this process. First, we found that IBV particles initially attach to lipid rafts on plasma membrane, and enter cells via CME, which requires the help of CHC and dynamin1. Additionally, we demonstrate that IBV particles are transported via early and late endosome, and fuse with late endosome-lysosome membrane to release the nucleocapsid.</p><p id="p-58">Lipid rafts are involved in regulation of different biological events, serve as organizing centers of signaling molecules assembly, and influence membrane fluidity and membrane protein trafficking (<a id="xref-ref-101-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-101">101</a>). The involvement of lipid rafts in virus entry, assembly and budding has been demonstrated by either the co-localization study of the viral structural proteins and lipid rafts or the effects of lipid rafts disrupting agents on the replication processes of several viruses (<a id="xref-ref-102-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-102">102</a>). The best characterized lipid rafts-related non-enveloped viral entry is simian virus 40 (SV40) and echovirus type 1 (EV1) (<a id="xref-ref-103-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-103">103</a>, <a id="xref-ref-104-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-104">104</a>). Binding of SV40 with MHC class I receptors triggers receptor clustering and redistribution, more caveolae is recruited from the cytoplasm at the site of entry, resulting in caveolae-mediated endocytosis in about 20 min (<a id="xref-ref-104-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-104">104</a>). In some cell types, SV40 can enter the caveosomes directly from lipid rafts in non-coated vesicles (<a id="xref-ref-105-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-105">105</a>). Similar to SV40, EV1 attachment and binding with cells triggers clustering and relocation of α2β1-integrin receptors from lipid rafts to the caveolae-like structures (<a id="xref-ref-104-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-104">104</a>). Depletion of cholesterol in lipid rafts inhibits EV1 infection (<a id="xref-ref-103-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-103">103</a>). For envelope virus, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Sindbis virus (SIN) require cholesterol and sphingolipids in target membrane lipid rafts for envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion and entry (<a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-29">29</a>). Many envelope virus receptors are located in lipid rafts or would be relocated into lipid rafts after infection, such as Human T-lymphotropic virus Type I (HTLV-1) receptor glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), Ebola virus and Marburg virus folate receptor-α (FRα), Hepatitis B virus complement receptor type 2 (CR2), Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) receptor CD46 (<a id="xref-ref-106-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-106">106</a>). An alternative receptor for Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein on epithelial cells is glycosphingolipid galactosyl-ceramide (GalCer), which also enriches at lipid rafts (<a id="xref-ref-107-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-107">107</a>, <a id="xref-ref-108-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-108">108</a>). Membrane cholesterol is also involved in the first stages of flavivirus infection (<a id="xref-ref-47-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-47">47</a>, <a id="xref-ref-109-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-109">109</a>). Guo <em>et al</em> demonstrate that IBV structural proteins, but not non-structural proteins, migrate and integrate into lipid rafts after viral protein translation. The cholesterol enriched microdomains were only involved in IBV attachment, not virus replication or virus particle release (<a id="xref-ref-38-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-38">38</a>). However, the involvement mechanisms of lipid rafts on IBV infectivity are still unclear. In our study, we substantiated the involvement of lipid rafts on virus life cycle via disruption of lipid rafts by using chemicals at pre-, during-, or post-infection, and checked IBV internalization, viral protein expression, and progeny virus release. Results showed that lipid rafts were involved in IBV entry step. Cholesterol replenishment experiment further confirmed that lipid rafts were necessary for IBV entry. Membrane flotation assay showed the co-fractionation of IBV particles and lipid rafts during absorption step. Immunofluoresence showed that R18-IBV associates with lipid rafts on the cells surface. Above evidence substantiates that IBV initiates the entry step by attaching to lipid rafts.</p><p id="p-59">Further experiment showed that chemical inhibitor of endosome acidification (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) treatment in various susceptible cells reduced the IBV internalization and protein expression, suggesting a requirement for transport of virions to endosomes. To further confirm our observations, we used inhibitor CPZ to interfere with CME, or knock down of CHC siRNA to specifically block CME, and we found that IBV internalization and gene expression were significantly decreased. This evidence determines the importance of CME in IBV entry, which is widely hijacked by various envelope viruses. Moreover, the importance of dynamin1, a GTPase that helps to snap the vesicle from plasma membrane, was determined during IBV entry. Lipid rafts is often considered to be involved in CavME. To explain these contradictory observations, Huh7, a caveolin deficient cell line (<a id="xref-ref-110-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-110">110</a>, <a id="xref-ref-111-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-111">111</a>), was used in the cholesterol depletion experiment. When cholesterol was depleted by chemicals or replenished in Huh7 cells, similar inhibition effect on IBV entry was observed as that in Vero and H1299 cells. These results confirm that although IBV attachment and entry depend on the intact lipid rafts, CME is the main endocytotic pathway for internalization.</p><p id="p-60">Our final research question was the virus trafficking route. By using R18-labeled IBV to infect cells, we found that IBV attachment leads to actin rearrangement and co-localized with actin filament after internalization. This indicates that virus internalization requires the actin de-polymerization or polymerization, to facilitate the virus containing vesicles to move along actin filament. However, stabilization of the actin filament using Jas and inhibition of actin polymerization using CytoD resulted in increase of virus entry. Rab5 and Rab7 GTPases are the key regulators of transport to early and late endosomes, and ablation of Rab5 and Rab7 has been widely used to study viral entry. Using R18-labeled virus, we found that after internalization, incoming IBV particles were first co-localized with Rab5 and then with Rab7, finally overlapped with lysosome marker LAMP1, across the entire endocytic network. The importance of Rab proteins were examined by overexpression and RNA interference technology. The results showed that Rab5 and Rab7 played crucial roles for IBV entry, confirming that IBV trafficking really depends on early and late endosomes. Also, using the R18 and DiOC double labeled virus, we revealed that the membrane fusion happens at 2-3 h.p.i., the time point of virus reaches late endosome-lysosome. Overexpression of VCP, a protein involved in endosome maturation, increased virus gene expression. We speculated that IBV particles were first transported to early endosomes in Rab5-demepdent manner, and were guided to late endosomes in Rab7 and VCP dependent manner. Also, the Rab7 dependence indicates that membrane fusion depends on endosomal maturation, suggesting that low pH environment in the late endosome-lysosome may provide an important signal for fusion and viral gRNA release.</p><p id="p-61">In conclusion, we conduct a systematic study to dissect IBV entry process in susceptible cell lines. The evidence presented here indicates that IBV attaches to lipid rafts, induces actin de-polymerization, internalizes into clathrin coated vesicles via dynamin1 snapping, transports along early/late endosome, and lysosome, finally fuses with late endosome-lysosome membrane, releases genome in to cytoplasm (<a id="xref-fig-12-1" class="xref-fig" href="#F12">Fig. 12</a>). An understanding of the cellular components involved in IBV invasion into the cell, is likely to open new opportunities to develop novel therapeutic approaches.</p><div id="F12" class="fig pos-float type-figure  odd"><div class="highwire-figure"><div class="fig-inline-img-wrapper"><div class="fig-inline-img"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/06/21/352898/F12.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1" title="Model of IBV internalization, trafficking, and fusion.
