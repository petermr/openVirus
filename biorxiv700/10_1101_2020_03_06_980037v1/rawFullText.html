<meta name="DC.Description" content="The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at the end of 2019 has resulted in widespread human infections across the globe. While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19." />

While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2 class="">Introduction</h2><p id="p-3">The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent for the infectious disease, SARS, which first emerged 17 years ago [<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-2">2</a>]. In December of 2019, another novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appeared to have crossed species barriers to infect humans and was effectively transmitted from person to person, leading to a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China [<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>–<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-5">5</a>]. As of 1 March 2020, this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread further within China and worldwide to 60 countries with over 87,000 confirmed cases and 2,980 fatalities [<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>]. The outbreak has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) and poses an increasing burden on global health and economy [<a id="xref-ref-6-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-6">6</a>].</p><p id="p-4">A study of 56 complete and partial SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from COVID-19 patients showed very high sequence conservation of more than 99%, indicating a recent introduction of the virus into the human population [<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-7">7</a>]. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that like SARS-CoV and bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), it belongs to lineage B of the betacoronavirus genus [<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>]. While SARS-CoV-2 shares higher whole-genome sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (88 – 89%) than with SARS-CoV (79 – 82%), the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV RBD, suggesting a possible common host cell receptor [<a id="xref-ref-8-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a id="xref-ref-9-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-9">9</a>]. In line with this, several groups have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV for viral entry [<a id="xref-ref-3-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>–<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-12">12</a>]. Due to its role in virus entry, the viral surface spike (S) glycoprotein has been the target for the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The S protein is functionally divided into two domains with the RBD-containing S1 subunit being responsible for attachment to host cell while the S2 subunit mediates fusion between viral and host membranes (reviewed by Li, F.) [<a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-13">13</a>]. Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established, SARS-CoV is believed to have originated from SL-CoVs residing in bats [<a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-14">14</a>–<a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a>]. For the majority of SL-CoVs, the S1 subunit has low sequence homology to that of SARS-CoV which indicates species-dependent receptor binding [<a id="xref-ref-17-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>]. On the other hand, the high amino acid sequence identity of more than 90% in the S2 subunit suggests that the fusion mechanism during virus infection is well-conserved [<a id="xref-ref-17-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a id="xref-ref-18-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-18">18</a>].</p><p id="p-5">In our previous work, we used an immunogenic fragment in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV to generate a panel of murine mAbs [<a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-19">19</a>].One of them, mAb 1A9, which binds to the S protein through a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111-1130, has the ability to bind and cross-neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing S of human SARS-CoV, civet SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV strains [<a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20">20</a>]. In this study, we show that the sequence of the immunogen used to generate mAb 1A9, as well as three other mAbs, is conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2 and these mAbs bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line.

Some of these may be able to cross-react with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and serve as tools to aid research on this newly emerged virus. In this current study, an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV was found to be highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, WB and IF analyses showed that 4 different mAbs generated using this SARS-CoV domain were cross-reactive against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, mAb 1A9 stained a significant number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells at 24h post-infection showing that it is sensitive enough to detect the expression of S during infection. Thus, these mAbs will be useful for studying the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and development of diagnostic assays for COVID-19. It is noteworthy that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes also reside at residues 884-891 and 1116-1123 within the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV [<a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>]. Interestingly, the latter CTL epitope overlaps with the epitope recognized by mAb 1A9 [<a id="xref-ref-20-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-20">20</a>]. Hence, the S2 subunit may serve as an important antigen for inducing both humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="p-23">Recent cross-reactivity studies have evaluated SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies that bind to the RBD-containing S1 subunit. Although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as a receptor for viral entry [<a id="xref-ref-3-3" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a id="xref-ref-10-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-10">10</a>], several SARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs did not cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD [<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a>,<a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a>]. Interestingly, CR3022, which was isolated from a SARS convalescent patient, showed cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and recognizes an epitope that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site [<a id="xref-ref-28-2" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. Besides the mAbs characterized here, several other mAbs have been reported to bind to epitopes in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV [<a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-29">29</a>–<a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="#ref-31">31</a>]. Thus, it will be important to determine if these mAbs can also cross-react with SARS-CoV-2.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-16"><h2 class="">Declaration of interest statement</h2><p id="p-25">WJH and YJT declare that they are involved in the licensing of mAb 1A9 to commercial companies as research or diagnostic reagents.
