Limiting IAV replication and alleviation of pulmonary inflammation are two important therapeutic strategies for influenza virus infection. Recent studies have shown that hypoxia inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) is an essential factor for the development and repair of ALI; however, the role and the underlying mechanisms of HIF-1&#x003b1; in IAV-induced ALI remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated that lung epithelial cell-specific <italic>Hif1&#x003b1;</italic> knockout mice infected with IAV developed more lung IAV replication and severe lung inflammation, which led to increased mortality compared to IAV-infected control mice. Moreover, knockdown of <italic>HIF1A</italic> in A549 cells (human alveolar type II epithelial cell line) promoted IAV replication <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mechanistically, knockdown of <italic>HIF1A</italic> reduced glycolysis by regulating transcription of glycolysis-related enzymes, which subsequently activated the AMPK&#x003b1;-ULK1 signalling pathway. Interestingly, AMPK&#x003b1;-ULK1 signalling promoted autophagy and augmented IAV replication. Taken together, deficiency of HIF-1&#x003b1; in lung epithelial cells reduces glycolysis and enhances AMPK&#x003b1;-ULK1-mediated autophagy, which finally facilitates IAV replication. These findings have deepened our understanding of the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in regulating IAV replication and provided us novel therapeutic targets for combating influenza infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>HIF-1&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>AMPK&#x003b1;</kwd><kwd>ULK1</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Natural Science Foundation of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001809</named-content></funding-source><award-id>81900010</award-id><award-id>81730001</award-id><award-id>91942305</award-id><award-id>81970075</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">the Strategic Leading Project (B) of CAS</named-content></funding-source><award-id>XDPB0303</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100002858</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2018M630935</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Innovative Research Team of High-level Local Universities in Shanghai</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Shanghai High-Level Local College Innovation Team Supporting plan</named-content></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work is supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (81900010; 81730001; 91942305; 81970075), the Strategic Leading Project (B) of CAS XDPB0303, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M630935), and Innovative Research Team of High-level Local Universities in Shanghai.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="46"/><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is an enveloped virus with a segmented negative-sense RNA genome and is classified according to its surface glycoproteins, hemaggluinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. H1N1 viral infections have been reported in most areas of the world and are a major cause of severe acute pneumonia, which often results in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a high risk of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, H1N1 epidemics and pandemics represent a severe challenge and a significant threat to public health.</p><p>IAV, like other viruses, requires the host cell machinery to produce infectious progeny. During the early stages of the viral life cycle, viruses enter the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis and are trafficked to the late endosome, where they fuse and release their genome into the cell. The genome segments are imported into the nucleus and catalysed by the viral polymerase to accomplish transcription and replication. The newly synthesized genome segments are exported from the nucleus and assembled at the cell membrane. In the final step, the budding virus particle is released into the extracellular environment from the host cell membrane [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Simultaneously with virus replication, both innate and adaptive immune responses are triggered shortly after infection. Host cells release cytokines as well as chemokines after activation. However, inordinate or unbalanced immune response can result in severe inflammation, including excessive recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells to the lungs, which damages lung tissue, reduces respiratory capacity, and causes severe disease and mortality [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, limiting viral replication is the first step towards the treatment of IAV infection.</p><p>Autophagy is a complicated and strictly regulated process, involving degradation and turnover of aged proteins and damaged organelles [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many studies have shown that autophagy functions as an adaptive cellular mechanism to deal with stressful stimuli such as starvation, oxidative stress, and pathogen invasion [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been reported recently that IAV NP- and M2-mediated autophagy promotes IAV replication by regulating the AKT-mTOR signalling pathway <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During autophagy, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3-I) is lipidated to form LC3-II, which serve as an indicator of autophagic activity and flux. LC3-II directly binds the selective autophagy cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome-1) and interacts with M2 and NP of IAV to increase viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) export and infectious viral particle formation [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Besides the AKT-mTOR signalling pathway, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK&#x003b1;) signalling also initiates autophagy under cellular energy stress. Reduction in cellular ATP levels initiates autophagy through AMPK&#x003b1;, which phosphorylates and activates Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1 kinase) to generate energy by increasing glucose uptake and glycolysis [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the function of AMPK&#x003b1;-ULK1 signalling in IAV infection and replication remains largely unknown.</p><p>Host factors are involved in every step of the life cycle of IAV, including cellular proteins and RNAs, which can be simply divided into those that support viral replication and those that play an antiviral role [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a major transcription factor that allows mammalian cells to adapt to low oxygen tension (hypoxia). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein that consists of two proteins, HIF-1&#x003b1; and HIF-1&#x003b2;. HIF-1&#x003b2; is the constitutively expressed subunit, but the expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; is upregulated rapidly in response to hypoxia [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1&#x003b1; is hydroxylated at conserved proline residues by the prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), which are oxygen dependent. Hydroxylated HIF-1&#x003b1; undergoes rapid proteasomal degradation by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated ubiquitination. This process results in low basal HIF-1&#x003b1; levels. Hypoxic conditions result in PHD inhibition and lower HIF-1&#x003b1; degradation, which results in HIF-1&#x003b1; accumulation and transcription of HRE (hypoxia response elements)-containing genes [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has been reported that HIF-1 activates the transcription of many genes that are involved in glucose metabolism [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], inflammation [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], angiogenesis [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], cell proliferation/survival and invasion/metastasis [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in IAV infection of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC2) is still elusive and deserves further investigation.</p><p>In this study, we provide molecular insights into how HIF-1&#x003b1; regulates the replication of IAV by interfering with AMPK&#x003b1; signalling-mediated autophagy in AEC2. We first demonstrated that epithelial cell-specific <italic>Hif1&#x003b1;</italic> knockout mice infected with IAV had more IAV replication in the lung and developed severe lung inflammation.

Viruses totally rely on host cell machinery to propagate and trigger metabolic reprogramming in host cells to facilitate optimal virus production [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is reported that influenza A virus increased glycolysis by enhancing glucose uptake and lactate production, as well as oxygen consumption rates [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; this is identical to our findings(<xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>(A)). One study in pediatric patients with respiratory infections also showed there was higher glucose metabolism in the lungs compared to control; oral treatment with BEZ235 (a putative PI3&#x02005;K/mTOR inhibitor) decreased glycolysis and reduced virus replication which resulted in decreased mortality in the mouse model of influenza infection [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

There is a antagonism between innate antiviral signalling and glycolysis; lactate produced by glycolysis is a natural suppressor of RLR signalling by targeting MAVS, whereas RLR activation suppresses glycolysis by inhibiting hexokinase [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Here, we show that HIF-1&#x003b1; enhances glycolysis by regulating transcription of glycolytic enzymes and therefore, when HIF-1&#x003b1; is absent, the cellular ATP pool is drastically reduced. Autophagy is a dynamic physiological process that can generate energy and nutrients for cell survival under stressors. This is a feedback response to lower energy level in IAV infection.

For IAV infection, HIF-1&#x003b1; has been verified to regulate the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration into the lung [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that deficiency of HIF-1&#x003b1; enhances the replication of IAV by promoting AMPK&#x003b1;-ULK1-mediated autophagy in AEC2. Notably, we and another group both found that HIF-1&#x003b1; is critical for the transcription and production of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines (<xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(D)) [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, HIF-1&#x003b1; is identified as a host restriction factor for IAV replication combined its role in antiviral cytokine expression and autophagy. Although antiviral cytokines expression was reduced in HIF-1&#x003b1; knockdown cell line, in the <italic>in vivo</italic> study, the lung inflammation and virus replication in <italic>Spc-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>.<italic>Hif1&#x003b1;</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were significantly higher compared to control <italic>Hif1&#x003b1;</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice during IAV infection. This finding suggests that increased antiviral cytokines expression, including <italic>Ifnb</italic>, might not play an important role in restricting viral replication in the AEC2 <italic>Hif1a</italic>-deleted lung. Taken together, we speculated that autophagy might be the key factor that promoted viral replication in the early stage of lung IAV infection in the AEC2 <italic>Hif1a</italic>-deleted lung. As we know proinflammatory or immune cells are the main source of cytokines, the current results might be due to increased cytokine production triggered by enhanced IAV replication in the early stage of IAV infection in <italic>Spc-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>.<italic>Hif1&#x003b1;</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Additional studies are needed to distinguish the different role and function of HIF-1&#x003b1; in autophagy and antiviral immune response during IAV infection.</p><p>In conclusion, our study unveils a novel mechanism that HIF-1&#x003b1; signalling controls the replication of IAV by regulating AMPK&#x003b1;-ULK1 signalling-mediated autophagy in AEC2s. This study has provided us new insights into the pathogenicity of IAV. Improved molecular understanding of the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in IAV replication in relation to glycolysis and autophagy in the host cells may facilitate the development of novel host-factor-directed antiviral therapeutics for influenza virus infection.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We appreciate Ling Li for technique support and Yaqiong Cui for mouse breeding.</p></sec><sec id="S006"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.</p></sec><sec id="S007"><title>ORCID</title><p><italic>Caiqi Zhao</italic>
