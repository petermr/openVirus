 <p>Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms belonging to the class of bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. These pathogens are transmitted, directly or indirectly, and can lead to epidemics or even pandemics. The resulting infection may lead to mild-to-severe symptoms such as life-threatening fever or diarrhea. Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data. This chapter aims at identifying potential applications of machine learning in the field of infectious diseases. We are deliberately focusing on key aspects of infection: diagnosis, transmission, response to treatment, and resistance. We are proposing the use of extreme values as an avenue of interest for future developments in the field of infectious diseases. This chapter covers a series of applications selectively chosen to showcase how artificial intelligence is moving the field of infectious disease further and how it helps institutions to better tackles them, especially in low-income countries.</p>
