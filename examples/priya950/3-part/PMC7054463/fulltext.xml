In the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, reports of a season-of-birth effect in schizophrenia were supported by large-scale ecological and sero-epidemiological studies suggesting that maternal influenza infection increases the risk of psychosis in offspring. We examine the evidence for the association between influenza infection and schizophrenia risk, before reviewing possible mechanisms <italic>via</italic> which this risk may be conferred. Maternal immune activation models implicate placental dysfunction, disruption of cytokine networks, and subsequent microglial activation as potentially important pathogenic processes. More recent neuroimmunological advances focusing on neuronal autoimmunity following infection provide the basis for a model of infection-induced psychosis, potentially implicating autoimmunity to schizophrenia-relevant protein targets including the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Finally, we outline areas for future research and relevant experimental approaches and consider whether the current evidence provides a basis for the rational development of strategies to prevent schizophrenia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>maternal immune activation (MIA)</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Wellcome Trust<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100004440</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Medical Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000265</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Medical Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000265</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="237"/><page-count count="19"/><word-count count="9062"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction: What Is the Evidence for an Association Between Influenza and Schizophrenia?</title><p>Schizophrenia risk is associated with a variety of environmental and genetic factors (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), including those associated with immunity and inflammation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicate loci at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which encodes multiple genes involved in immunity such as the <italic>human leukocyte antigen</italic> (<italic>HLA</italic>) genes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and complement component 4 (C4) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), among others, and enhancers related to B-lymphocyte lineages (CD19 and CD20 lines) involved in acquired/adaptive immunity (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Overall there is strong evidence supporting the involvement of specific immune variants in schizophrenia risk (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), some evidence of convergence across genomics, transcriptomic, and methylomic processes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), but conflicting evidence for both (i) enrichment of specific immune cell types or pathways (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and (ii) for genetic overlap between SZ and specific immune diseases (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Substantial epidemiological evidence exists suggesting that maternal, perinatal, childhood, and adult infection may all increase the risk of schizophrenia diagnosis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). While many organisms and infection types have been implicated in schizophrenia risk, the influenza virus has special status: not only is maternal influenza infection the most well-replicated infective risk factor for schizophrenia, but the history of schizophrenia research has been shaped at crucial points by observations concerning the apparent, sometimes surprising, role of influenza as an exposure. This review aims to present the current state of knowledge on mechanisms by which influenza infection may confer schizophrenia risk, along with the implications of this understanding for future research, prevention, and treatment.</p><p>Before the focus of this review moves to schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, it should be noted that some of the associations that will be discussed are now thought not to be specific to schizophrenia risk. The late winter/spring season of birth effect has also been reported in bipolar disorder (BD) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), but the evidence for a link between BD and influenza is somewhat mixed (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and addressed in limited studies (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Influenza (including serologically documented infection) has been reported as a risk factor for BD with psychotic features but not nonpsychotic BD [reviewed in (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)]. Furthermore, some evidence suggests an association between maternal infection and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [reviewed in (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)]. A substantial body of work from Scandinavian (largely Danish) health register studies supports the notion that clinically diagnosed maternal, childhood, or adulthood infection is a pluripotent risk factor for the subsequent development of psychiatric disorder, with effects observed across diagnostic boundaries (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, while the focus of this review is on schizophrenia and psychosis, the potential transdiagnostic relevance of some of the mechanisms reviewed here should not be ignored.</p><p>Currently, influenza is regarded predominantly as a respiratory illness, but before the last century a far broader conceptualisation existed. As early as a 1732 epidemic, clinicians made note of the nervous sequelae of infection, with manifestations including neurasthenia, melancholy, hysteria, mental prostration, and insanity (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). According to the historian of medicine Mark Honigsbaum: &#x0201c;in the mid-1890s British medical journals were full of tales of Victorian professionals driven to the brink of madness and beyond by the nervous sequelae of influenza&#x02026; for some 30 years, from the first epidemics of Russian influenza in the 1890s through to the &#x02018;Spanish&#x02019; influenza of 1918&#x02013;19, the &#x02018;psychoses of influenza' were a widely recognised psychiatric phenomenon&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In 1919, Karl Menninger published a now-classic paper reporting the characteristics of 100 patients with mental disturbances associated with influenza infection admitted in a 3-month period to the Boston Psychopathic Hospital. Of 80 on whom full data were available, 16 were diagnosed with delirium, 25 with &#x0201c;dementia praecox,&#x0201d; 23 with &#x0201c;other psychoses,&#x0201d; and 16 were unclassified (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Interestingly, two-thirds of the &#x0201c;dementia praecox&#x0201d; patients were reported to have fully recovered at 5-year follow up (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). A further historically important strand of evidence came from von Economo's (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) research on encephalitis lethargica (EL), a still poorly understood inflammatory CNS condition featuring psychotic and catatonic symptoms, which was broadly contemporaneous with and potentially aetiologically related to the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza pandemic. <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">

Renewed interest in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century shifted focus towards maternal infection, following consistent findings of an increased risk for schizophrenia in late winter/spring season births (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), raising the possibility of winter-borne infection as a plausible mechanism. Beginning with Mednick et al.'s 1988 study of a Finnish population exposed to the 1957 influenza A2 pandemic, epidemiological studies in the 1980s&#x02013;1990s, of an ecological nature, described increased risk for schizophrenia in children who were <italic>in utero</italic> during an influenza epidemic (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). These studies are comprehensively reviewed in (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Frequently, rates were highest for second trimester exposures, although the first trimester appeared also to be a period of increased risk. Some subsequent studies however&#x02014;often with more accurate case ascertainment and larger samples&#x02014;were not able to replicate these initial findings [e.g. (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>)]. While estimates of risk varied greatly and heterogeneity in methodology somewhat limits generalisability, a 2010 review calculated that maternal influenza exposure increased schizophrenia risk with an odds ratio of 3.0 and a population attributable proportion of 14% (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>Partly because of the manifold methodological problems involved in imputing precisely who was exposed to influenza, these ecological studies were followed by so-called &#x0201c;sero-epidemiological&#x0201d; studies, in which infection was verified using archived biological specimens: in one such early study first trimester maternal exposure was associated with a sevenfold increase in offspring schizophrenia risk, with threefold increase in risk associated with early-to-mid gestation exposure (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p><p>Other studies explored whether other viral and bacterial infections are associated with differential schizophrenia risk. A meta-analysis found that childhood viral infection was associated with a nearly twofold increased risk of adult nonaffective psychosis and that of all childhood infections, viral infections in particular, were associated with a nearly twofold increased risk of adult schizophrenia (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, bacterial infections were not associated with risk for psychosis, suggesting that risk may be specific for childhood viral infections.</p><p>Some controversy persists as to whether the evidence for maternal influenza as a schizophrenia risk factor is sufficient. A recent review of studies of schizophrenia risk in relation to the 1957 influenza pandemic criticised the serological studies for using strain-specific antibody titres that were too low to be specific for recent infection and so were insufficient as proxy measures of recent infection; furthermore, a pooled meta-analysis of eight ecological studies and one serological study found no overall increased risk of schizophrenia in children of influenza-exposed mothers (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). This review was in turn criticised as inappropriate given the heterogeneity of methods used in the pooled studies (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>); furthermore it appeared to omit some relevant serological data [e.g. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>)] and as it focuses on the 1957 pandemic only, it does not include studies on other strains of influenza infection and psychosis.</p><p>Complicating interpretation of ecological/epidemiological and serological studies is the fact that obstetric complications are more likely following influenza or influenza-like illness, and that obstetric complications are an independent risk factor for the subsequent development of psychotic disorders and/or symptoms (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>).</p><sec id="s1_1"><title>Reconciling Maternal Infection With Influenza With the Neurodevelopmental Hypothesis of Schizophrenia</title><p>The late 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of neurodevelopmental theories offering mechanistic accounts of how schizophrenia develops. The neurodevelopmental hypothesis (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) posits that schizophrenia results from a pathological disruption of normal brain development which commences many years before schizophrenia onset (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Infection and other insults could disrupt developmental processes such as cell proliferation, cell migration, arborisation, and myelination (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) with resulting brain structural alterations [e.g. ventricular enlargement, grey matter reductions, and white matter disruption; (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>)]; activation of pathologically developed brain systems in adolescence or young adulthood then manifests in schizophrenia symptoms (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>).</p><p>Amongst other criticisms, the theory fails to account for later-onset schizophrenia [45 years or older; (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>)] and postadolescence changes (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Extended neurodevelopmental models posited further &#x0201c;hits,&#x0201d; e.g., genetic and environmental factors first predisposing to schizophrenia prenatally and then later in life [&#x0201c;three-hit&#x0201d; model, (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>); multiple hit theory, (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>)]. Infection is a possible &#x0201c;hit&#x0201d;; for instance, human endogenous retrovirus infections, activated by viruses including influenza, were suggested as late &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). This theory is consistent with evidence that maternal infection contributes to later increased offspring risk for childhood infections, which in turn contribute to schizophrenia development (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>).</p><p>There is no clear evidence that genetic liability to schizophrenia increases the likelihood of influenza infection or predisposes to a disrupted immune response to influenza, or that influenza genetic risk loci are implicated in schizophrenia. In terms of genetic risk for influenza infection, while significant genetic effects accounting for the antibody level in influenza A and B (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) have been reported with <italic>h</italic>

However, another GWAS of IgG response to viruses identified HLA class II residues as causal variants and found an overlap between variants affecting the humoral response to influenza A and variants linked to influenza-related autoimmune disorders including narcolepsy (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Neither of these studies nor any others to date have directly addressed the issue of overlap between genetic risk for schizophrenia and specific risk for influenza infection, although this has been explored for other pathogens (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). A UK population-based cohort study of 7,921 mothers found no association between schizophrenia polygenic risk score (PRS) and perinatal infection (using a single &#x0201c;any infection&#x0201d; category) (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Similarly, a case-control study by Benros et al. explored an association between schizophrenia PRS and a history of hospital contacts for viral infections, including influenza infection: PRS for schizophrenia did not account for the association between hospitalisation for infection and subsequent schizophrenia risk, indicating that schizophrenia risk does not increase proneness to such severe infections (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The Influenza Virus and Potential Pathological Mechanisms Underlying the Association Between Schizophrenia and Influenza Infection</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Influenza: Structure and Pathophysiology</title><p>The influenza virus is an enveloped RNA virus from the family <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, with three genera, influenza A, B, and C (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>).

Protective immune responses from the cell occur; the viral hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix 2 (M2) proteins are targeted by antibodies; matrix 1 (M1) proteins are targeted by T cells (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>); and nucleoproteins are targeted by T cells (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) and nonneutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title>Experimental Paradigms of <break/>Maternal Infection</title><p>While maternal infection is reported to be a risk factor for schizophrenia, controversy remains concerning which biological processes underlie this risk. There is scant evidence for transplacental passage and persistence of the influenza virus in the offspring brain (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). More likely to be relevant are the effects of infection-induced maternal immune activation (MIA) on the developing brain (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>).</p><p>MIA cannot be easily modelled in humans and longitudinal, prospective research on effects of infection during pregnancy on human development is scarce (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Hence, translational animal models of MIA have been developed: these models have been critical in providing causality to the epidemiological data and are starting to provide clues as to the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may underlie the associations (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Rodents in gestational periods are exposed either directly to a pathogen such as influenza, or more commonly to nonvirulent immune-activating agents such as the viral mimetic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly(I:C)) or the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the inflammatory agent turpentine, or specific proinflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). These animal models of MIA provide evidence for behavioral, neurochemical, neuroanatomic, and neurophysiologic disruptions in the offspring which map onto endophenotypes observed across human psychiatric disorders with a neurodevelopmental onset (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Such translational research complements the insights from human epidemiology by establishing causal relationships, identifying cellular and molecular mechanisms and offering the potential to explore therapeutic interventions (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Frequently, these aforementioned deficits in the MIA model demonstrate a maturational delay, such that they are not evident before young adulthood, and many studies have sought to mitigate these deficits with treatments (e.g., pharmacological, immunological, behavioral) (<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Another important etiological advance for such animal models is to recapitulate a &#x0201c;two-hit&#x0201d; approach, in which pathology becomes evident in MIA-exposed offspring only after a second hit, such as unpredictable psychological stress (<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>).</p><p>MIA may lead straightforwardly to damage to the foetal brain during the early stages of neurodevelopment (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>), but may also provide entry into a deviant trajectory of neural development which predisposes offspring to behavioral deficits depending on the intensity of the infection and when in gestation it occurs [early vs. late&#x02014;and potentially as late as the lactation stage (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>)]. MIA-associated abnormalities have been described, sometimes inconsistently, for multiple brain cell types, all of which are implicated across psychiatric disorders from postmortem data and genetic studies to a greater or lesser extent: Schwann cells (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>), astrocytes and microglia (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), hippocampal GABAergic cells (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>), dopaminergic neurons (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>), and parvalbumin interneurons (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>).</p><p>Notably, most rodent (and primate) MIA models use a dose of poly(I:C) which models a high intensity, acute and transient (&#x0003c;24 h) infection, the physiological relevance of which could be questioned. Furthermore, factors such as the source, molecular weight, and endotoxin contamination of experimental poly(I:C) may be unrecognised sources of variability in foetal outcomes (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). Although MIA models specifically using pathogens as the immune activating stimulus have become rarer in recent years, primarily due to increasingly stringent safety frameworks around the use of potentially virulent pathogens (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>), a series of MIA studies using human H1N1 influenza infection by the group of S. Hossein Fatemi are particularly valuable in elucidating potential mechanisms of psychosis risk.

Inference regarding the translational relevance of these findings, too, has been limited by a lack of clarity around the utility of the putative human markers of microglial activation such as translocator protein (TSPO), bound by ligands in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, and of microglial markers used in post-mortem studies; notably, in addition to microglia, both astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells show dynamic changes in TSPO expression in response to inflammatory stimuli, and in a mouse model schizophrenia-relevant behavioral abnormalities and increased inflammatory cytokine expression were associated with reduced, rather than increased, prefrontal TSPO levels (<xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>).</p><p>Both neurotropic and nonneurotropic influenza strains can cause microglial activation and potentially contribute to inflammation (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>).

Subsequently, the cooccurrence of schizophrenia with celiac disease was noted [e.g. (<xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>)].

An intriguing association between infection and the development of the disorder became apparent when it was observed that a number of patients experiencing &#x0201c;relapses&#x0201d; following herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NMDAR antibodies, suggesting that these &#x0201c;relapses&#x0201d; were in fact a postinfectious AE, rather than the result of reinfection or viral reactivation (<xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>).

In molecular mimicry, there is sharing of sequences, such as linear amino acid sequences, by molecules from dissimilar genes or their protein products.

H1N1 infection in rabbits has also been shown to induce brain-reactive antibodies, including to a 37kDa target also present in humans (<xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>). Precedent for the role of influenza exposure initiating neurological disorder, potentially <italic>via</italic> molecular mimicry, exists for Guillain-Barre syndrome (<xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>) and narcolepsy, in which hypocretin-producing neurons could be an autoimmune target due to molecular mimicry between H1N1 virus-derived antigen and a neuronal autoantigen in <italic>HLA-DQB1*06:02</italic> positive patients (<xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>, <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>); see (<xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>) for an example model of narcolepsy. This association is supported by epidemiological findings of an increased risk of narcolepsy in children following the H1N1 vaccination, Pandemrix (<xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>, <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>), and by serological findings that antibodies to influenza nucleoprotein might cross-react with hypocretin receptor 2 in patients with Pandemrix vaccination [(<xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>), although see (<xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>)].</p><p>Further evidence for molecular mimicry as a bridging link between influenza infection, the adaptive immune response and neurodevelopmental risk for schizophrenia comes from gene sequence overlap between the H5N1 virus and genes abnormally regulated in schizophrenia (<xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>). Furthermore, the H1N1 influenza antiviral protein hemagglutinin was found to share peptide structure with a variety of human axon guidance proteins; the majority of proteins identified as containing homologous sequences are involved in processes which, if disrupted, could lead to deviant neurodevelopmental trajectories. The observed peptide matches were conserved across influenza strains and frequently involved experimentally validated hemagglutinin epitopes (<xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>). Finally, the NMDAR 2A subunit was found to share peptides with several pathogens, including the influenza A virus (<xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>). The findings suggest that anti-pathogen immune responses to the influenza A virus may cross-react with multiple schizophrenia-related proteins. This reaction could potentially trigger processes which may ultimately lead to schizophrenia. Work from our group has confirmed the higher-than-expected overlap between the influenza proteome and schizophrenia-relevant proteins, additionally identifying hemagglutinin as contributing, amongst influenza proteins, the most extensive peptide sharing [Kepinska et al., <italic>in submission</italic>; see also (<xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>)].</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion and Future Directions</title><p>Converging evidence demonstrates that infection with the influenza virus has a multiplicity of effects on prenatal and postnatal processes which, when disrupted, could result in increased risk of the development of schizophrenia or acute psychoses in adulthood. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">

To date, MIA models typically include very little deep immunophenotyping, and discussion of the adaptive immune response in these models has been almost entirely lacking. Standardised and more sensitive testing technologies are required, including improved noninvasive methods to assess central neuroinflammation in humans and nonhuman animals (<xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>, <xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>).</p><p>Recent developments in stem cell technology suggest the possibility of using induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) microglia-like cells [as per (<xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>)] to assess how influenza infection affects the phenotype of these cells. Potentially, iPSC-derived cerebral organoids [so-called &#x02018;mini brains&#x02019; (<xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>)] could offer a window into the effects of influenza infection on relevant aspects of neurodevelopment.</p><p>While this paper reviews limited case studies and series indicating that in some instances influenza vaccination has been linked to CNS-directed autoimmunity, there is currently no evidence demonstrating a clear association between influenza vaccination and the development of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. The limited reported cases constitute a weight of evidence which is far weaker than the many epidemiological studies supporting the association between maternal influenza infection and schizophrenia. Influenza vaccination&#x02014;both pandemic and seasonal&#x02014;has saved and continues to save countless millions of lives worldwide, with an overwhelming evidence base supporting its efficacy. Within this context, influenza vaccination may nonetheless represent an as-yet underutilised opportunity for epidemiological and mechanistic explorations of potential influenza-psychosis associations. For example, healthy volunteers having the vaccination could be assessed using immunophenotyping, brain imaging, and behavioral measures to further characterize the acute response to influenza exposure [analogous to similar human studies of the acute response to LPS or typhoid vaccine administration (<xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>)].</p><p>From the perspective of prevention of psychosis, consideration has been given to the potential use of antiviral medication in at-risk pregnant women. Although human studies are lacking, pilot studies in mice suggest that giving oseltamivir to pregnant mice can prevent some influenza-induced changes in the offspring (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). And while oseltamivir is regarded as having a favourable profile in pregnancy, there are no data on the long-term effects on neurodevelopment in human children.</p><p>Consideration has also been given to the potential role of influenza vaccines prior to, or during, pregnancy as a preventive measure to limit the prenatal teratogenic influence of viruses (<xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>). The seasonal influenza vaccine has established efficacy in preventing maternal infection, as well as partially preventing the infant through passive immunity, and its administration remains best practice for protection of mother and child, with the World Health Organisation recognising pregnant women as a priority vulnerable group. In addition, educating pregnant women to contact their healthcare provide if they have a fever is recommended in order to expedite administration of antiviral medication and supportive care (<xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>). Some authors consider the fact that influenza vaccination is not recommended in the first trimester in some countries as cause for concern, leaving women and the developing foetus vulnerable during a critical neurodevelopmental window (<xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>). Epidemiologically, first trimester (or any other trimester) pandemic influenza vaccination does not appear to be associated with increased childhood morbidity (<xref rid="B229" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>). Although neurodevelopmental outcome data are largely lacking, some mouse models suggested that influenza vaccination early in pregnancy can indeed promote behavioral function and neurogenesis in the offspring, and confer protection from the effects of MIA with LPS (<xref rid="B230" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>, <xref rid="B231" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>). One note of caution has been raised by a cohort study of nearly 200,000 children in California which reported a small but statistically significantly increased risk of ASD following first trimester vaccination (<xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>); unsurprisingly the report was controversial, with ensuing disagreement concerning interpretation of the findings and whether the correct statistical measures were used (<xref rid="B233" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>, <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>).</p><p>Given that the vast majority of children of mothers who experience an infection do not develop psychiatric disease, recent consideration has been given to maternal and foetal mechanisms of resilience to perinatal infection and inflammation: these include maternal nutritional status, the microbiome, and a variety of postnatal environmental factors (<xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>). In terms of interventions within the MIA paradigm that have potential widespread relevance, dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may represent an attractive preventative strategy (<xref rid="B236" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>, <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>).</p><p>An increase in our understanding of neuro-immune interactions has enabled a fuller understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and have contributed to a more nuanced picture of schizophrenia pathogenesis which can accommodate the influence of influenza infections after the perinatal period. Our understanding of both influenza and schizophrenia has changed immensely since the 1918-1919 pandemic. The development of next-generation genetic, immunological and bioinformatic technologies may bring a resolution of the centuries-old puzzle of the relationship between influenza and psychosis.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>TP, RM, CI and AK developed the initial idea for the review.
