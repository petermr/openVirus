In most areas of China, the influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates are relatively low and public awareness of vaccination is insufficient. Therefore, there is a pressing need for raising public awareness of vaccination and immunization coverage rates. Public awareness of vaccination is closely related to popularization of scientific knowledge and health education by medical personnel.

</p><p>The dominant strains and activity intensity of influenza viruses in different periods and regions exhibit distinct characteristics. Climate factors are the strongest predictors of influenza seasonality, including the lowest temperature, hours of sunshine, and maximum rainfall. Low temperature is a predictor of winter influenza occurrence and annual cyclical intensity in northern China, whereas in southern China, influenza activity is related mainly to rainfall. That knowledge can be drawn upon when devising strategies for determining the optimal times for influenza vaccination. In 2013, Yu et al<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">

In 1933, scientists at the National Institute of Medical Research in London began to develop the first live attenuated influenza vaccine by successfully isolating the first influenza virus. The United States and the United Kingdom subsequently successfully developed the first monovalent type A (H1N1) inactivated influenza vaccine. Since then, influenza vaccine development has progressed remarkably rapidly. In 1942, a bivalent influenza vaccine was developed after the detection of influenza B virus. In 1978, when influenza A virus (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B virus were simultaneously prevalent, a trivalent influenza vaccine type A(H1N1)/A(H3N2)/B was introduced.<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> In the late 1980s, two strains of influenza B virus were discovered, Victoria and Yamagata, which were alternately prevalent. The WHO recommended a trivalent component vaccine containing only one component from each strain, but there is no cross&#x02010;protection between the two strains, which can lead to a mismatch between the actual circulating strains and vaccine candidates for influenza B vaccine strains in component vaccines.<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> Therefore, since 2012, recommendations issued by the WHO with regard to influenza vaccine composition have included both the Victoria and Yamagata strains, and two components that are updated annually, which constitutes a tetravalent vaccine.</p><p>Most influenza vaccines are manufactured via virus propagation in eggs or are cultured by Madin&#x02010;Darby canine kidney cells or Vero cells. Although the whole&#x02010;virus vaccine is still used in some countries, the split vaccine has become mainstream since the first split virion influenza vaccine was launched in 1968. Since then, a subunit vaccine has been obtained by purifying and removing the endoantigen on the basis of the split vaccine. To increase the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines, some manufacturers have also developed adjuvant influenza vaccines. In 2009, high&#x02010;dose inactivated influenza vaccines were first used in the United States for vaccination for adults aged 65 and over.<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> Influenza vaccines that are currently available internationally include inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), and live attenuated influenza vaccine, all of which are available in trivalent or tetravalent formulations. The IIVs include three types: whole&#x02010;virus vaccine, split&#x02010;virus vaccine, and subunit vaccine. The influenza vaccines currently used in China are all trivalent IIVs (TIVs).<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">

In humoral immunity, influenza vaccines mainly induce the production of antibodies against influenza virus surface glycoproteins.

</xref> but both the number of T lymphocytes and their proliferative capacity decrease in elderly people. Therefore, the immune response in elderly people is comparatively lower.</p><p>Adjuvants and high&#x02010;dose influenza vaccines have been explored to improve vaccine immunogenicity. Adjuvants can enhance immune responses to influenza&#x02010;specific antigens, producing stronger immune effects than the antigens alone. Compared with a standard&#x02010;dose vaccine, high&#x02010;dose IIV3 (IIV3&#x02010;HD) improves antibody responses to influenza in adults aged 65&#x000a0;years or older.<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">

The WHO recommends that influenza vaccine components be updated annually because of the ever&#x02010;changing antigenic nature of influenza virus. To provide maximum protection for the vaccinated population, it is still recommended that recipients vaccinate again in the current influenza season, as the antibody titers in most vaccine recipients decline substantially after a year, even if the antigenic influenza vaccine components are exactly the same as those in the previous season.<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">

<italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, also known as pneumococcus, is a gram&#x02010;positive encapsulated diplococcus bacterium. It is ubiquitous in the natural environment and humans are its primary natural host. The polysaccharide capsule of the bacterium is an essential virulence factor, and more than 90 serotypes have been defined based on differences in capsule compositions. The serotype spectrums vary in different age groups and different seasons and regions, but the general distributions of the most common pathogenic serotypes are the same throughout the world.<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">

</p><p>The transmission of <italic>S&#x000a0;pneumoniae</italic> mainly occurs via direct respiratory droplets or infection caused by bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract.

Invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), such as meningitis, streptococcal pneumonia, and bacteremia, occur when the bacteria invade the bloodstream; these diseases are associated with high mortality. <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> results in bacteremia pneumonia in approximately 20% of cases. Reportedly, up to 30 <italic>S&#x000a0;pneumoniae</italic> serotypes are responsible for more than 80% of IPDs in all age groups globally.

Although it has been circulated in China, PCV13 has not yet been approved for use in elderly people. Therefore, herein only recommendations pertaining to PPSV23 vaccination are provided. PPSV23 vaccination should follow national regulations and vaccine instructions, such as those advocated in the Regulations on Vaccine Circulation and Vaccination and Standard Practices for Vaccination.</p><sec id="agm212102-sec-0029"><label>3.7.1</label><title>Target population and schedule of pneumococcal vaccine</title><p>Adults aged&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;years should receive one dose of PPSV23. Revaccination is generally not recommended in immunocompetent people, but it is now recommended that elderly people who have a high risk of severe pneumococcal infection and who have been vaccinated more than 5&#x000a0;years previously be revaccinated. People aged&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;years who have not been vaccinated within 5&#x000a0;years (including those who were aged&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;years at the time of their last vaccination) can be revaccinated. Because data on the safety of administering PPSV23 three or more times are insufficient, additional vaccinations after the first revaccination (that is, two vaccinations in total) are not routinely recommended.</p><p>Those with the following risk factors for pneumococcal infection should be given priority: chronic illness, such as chronic pulmonary disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchiectasis); chronic cardiovascular disease (eg, congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathies, but excluding hypertension); chronic liver disease (cirrhosis); cochlear implants; diabetes mellitus; cerebrospinal fluid leaks; alcoholism; functional or anatomic asplenia (congenital or acquired asplenia, sickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathies, splenic dysfunction, or splenectomy); and conditions associated with reduced immune function (such as congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, HIV, nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, generalized malignancy, multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphomas, Hodgkin&#x02019;s disease, solid organ transplantation and bone marrow transplantation, and those receiving immunosuppressive medication, long&#x02010;term systemic corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy).<xref rid="agm212102-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">
