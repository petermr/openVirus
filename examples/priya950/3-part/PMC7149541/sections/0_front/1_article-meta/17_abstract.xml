 <p>Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality associated with lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children worldwide. The World Health Organization recognizes the need to develop and implement prevention strategies to reduce the impact of RSV in early life as a global health priority. RSV vaccination during pregnancy is a feasible strategy to achieve this goal. Vaccines for maternal immunization against RSV are in active development and could be implemented in the near future within existing maternal-child health platforms. In addition, infant protection may be achieved through either passive antibody administration or active immunization, depending on infant health status, given that options for these complementary interventions are being developed in parallel to vaccines for maternal immunization.</p>
