  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the only known vector for dengue virus (DENV) in New Caledonia (NC). DENV are divided into four serotypes (DENV-1 to -4), based on their antigenic properties, these being subdivided into different genotypes. All four DENV serotypes have regularly circulated in New Caledonia in the past. An unusual persistence of DENV-1 has been observed during the last ten years, suggesting a possible preferential transmission of this DENV serotype by

  <italic>aegypti</italic>. In this study, we examine for the first time the ability of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> from New Caledonia to transmit the four circulating DENV serotypes, and more precisely two genotypes of DENV-1. Our results demonstrate that this vector is moderately competent for DENV, with slight differences observed between DENV serotype/genotype in terms of transmission. These findings suggest that other factors are at play in the sustained circulation of DENV-1 and that further vector-virus interactions studies should be undertaken to better understand the DENV epidemiological profile in NC.
