 <p>In order to combat the rising regional incidence of dengue in South East Asia, incidence patterns must be better characterised within different ecological settings. We conducted the first retrospective analysis of dengue epidemiology in the predominantly rural state of Sabah, Malaysia, where both urban and sylvatic transmission cycles exist. Human notification data over a 7-year period were reviewed and spatiotemporal and demographic risk factors identified. We found that: 1. While urban habitats do play a role in mediating the spread of dengue in Sabah, cases from both urban and rural localities contributed equally to dengue outbreaks; 2. Human demographic risk factors included being aged between 10 and 29 years, and being male; 3. Cases of severe dengue were more common in the eastern districts of the state–almost half of severe dengue cases were reported from Sandakan and Tawau; and 4. The presence of 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> in and around the majority of urban and rural case households, often in the apparent absence of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic>, suggests that its role in transmission requires further investigation. This study emphasises that increasing incidence of dengue in urban South East Asia is also mirrored in more rural areas, and suggests a need for control strategies that address both urban and rural dengue risk.
