Abstract</div> <p>Acute viral hepatitis refers to hepatic infection by the hepatotropic viruses hepatitis A–E. The acute infections look similar with regard to histologic features, with spotty necrosis throughout the lobules, hepatocyte unrest, swelling and apoptosis, and portal tract and intrasinusoidal inflammation, chiefly lymphocytes. The differential diagnosis histologically includes drug-induced liver injury. Structural differences and epidemiology define the major differences in the course of each of these viral infections. Hepatitis A and E are similar in causing only acute hepatitis, while some cases of hepatitis B and many of hepatitis C become chronic. The prevalence of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection has seen a reduction worldwide due to hepatitis B vaccination programs. Nonetheless, major cities with continued intravenous drug use remain reservoirs with a rate of approximately 8% in Europe. The availability of direct-acting viral agents is spearheading efforts by WHO to eliminate new and chronic HCV infections by 2019. Histologic cholestasis may be a particular feature of acute hepatitis E. It should be noted that hepatitis E virus has four major genotypes of which 1 and 2 infect humans (resulting in travel/endemic-related hepatitis with cholestasis and high mortality in pregnant women) and 3 and 4 are zoonotic and infect pigs, boar and several other animal and avian species (and may cause hepatitis associated with poorly or uncooked meat).</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="p0010">Acute hepatitis is not usually an indication for liver biopsy. There are, however, at least three reasons why pathologists sometimes receive liver biopsy samples from patients with acute hepatitis. First, there may be doubt about the clinical diagnosis, or even a mistaken working diagnosis. Second, a diagnosis of hepatitis may be well established but the clinician needs information on the stage of the disease or its severity. Third, the patient may have received a liver transplant and the pathologist is being asked to help decide if symptoms or biochemical abnormalities are due to recurrent (or new) viral hepatitis or to some other cause such as rejection. For all these reasons, a knowledge of the pathology of acute hepatitis is essential. There is a further reason, no less important than the others: without a knowledge of acute hepatitis, the pathologist cannot hope to understand chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, together the cause of most liver disease in the world. This chapter describes acute viral hepatitis and its immediate sequelae in the immunocompetent patient. The specific problems of diagnosing hepatitis in an immunosuppressed patient after transplantation are reviewed in <b>Chapter 16</b>.</p> <p id="p0015">The hepatitis viruses are listed in <a href="#t0010">Table 6.1</a> . While several other candidates have been extensively investigated in recent years, none has so far been established as a definite cause of viral hepatitis, and most episodes of acute and chronic hepatitis can be attributed to one of the viruses listed, to autoimmune hepatitis (<b>Ch. 9</b>) or to a hepatotoxic agent (<b>Ch. 8</b>). An exception to this statement is fulminant hepatitis, the cause of which cannot currently be established in a substantial minority of patients,<a href="#bib1">1.</a>, <a href="#bib2">2.</a>, <a href="#bib3">3.</a> including children.<a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> Occasionally, a virus more often associated with infection of other organs, such as one of the herpesviruses<a href="#bib5">5.</a>, <a href="#bib6">6.</a>, <a href="#bib7">7.</a> or an adenovirus,<a href="#bib8">8.</a>, <a href="#bib9">9.</a> gives rise to a severe hepatitis. These agents are further discussed in <b>Chapter 15</b>. Mild acute hepatitis has been reported in patients infected with the SARS virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus).<a href="#bib10">10.</a>, <a href="#bib11">11.</a><div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" position="float" id="t0010"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 6.1</span> </div></p><p>The hepatitis viruses</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th>Virus</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Spread and disease</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Hepatitis A (HAV)</td> <td>RNA hepatovirus</td> <td>Faecal–oral, acute</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hepatitis B (HBV)</td> <td>DNA hepadnavirus</td> <td>Parenteral, acute or chronic</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hepatitis C (HCV)</td> <td>RNA hepacivirus</td> <td>Parenteral or sporadic; acute, more often chronic</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hepatitis D (HDV)</td> <td>RNA deltavirus, defective</td> <td>Pathogenic when combined with HBV</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hepatitis E (HEV)</td> <td>RNA virus</td> <td>Faecal–oral, epidemic or sporadic acute disease</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> <p id="p0020">Occasionally, mild serum liver test abnormalities and mild histological hepatitis (bystander hepatitis) with apoptotic bodies, focal necrosis and lymphocytic inflammation are seen in systemic, non-hepatic viral infections such as pulmonary influenza and result from migration to the liver of, and collateral damage by, CD8 T lymphocytes.<a href="#bib12">12.</a>, <a href="#bib13">13.</a></p> </div> <div class="pathologicalfeatures" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Pathological features</div> <p id="p0025">The essential components of the acute phase of hepatitis are inflammatory-cell infiltration and hepatocellular damage. Other features include cholestasis, Kupffer-cell activation, endotheliitis, bile-duct damage, the ductular reaction and hepatocellular regeneration. </p> <div class="hepatocellulardamage" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Hepatocellular damage</div> <p id="p0030">Changes seen under the light microscope range from minor degrees of cell swelling to cell death. They are accompanied by the inflammatory infiltration described below, reflecting the important role of cellular immunity in the pathogenesis of most forms of hepatitis. Both hepatocellular damage and inflammation are usually most severe in perivenular areas, giving rise to a characteristic histological pattern (<a href="#f0010">Fig. 6.1</a> ). A periportal pattern of necrosis and inflammation, sometimes seen in hepatitis A, is less common. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.1</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis.</p> <p>Surviving hepatocytes in the perivenular area in the centre of the field are swollen and the area is infiltrated by inflammatory cells.</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="p0035">The mildest change is cell swelling, and this is probably reversible. The cytoplasm of affected cells is rarified, granular and sometimes finely vacuolated. The more severe degrees of cell swelling are called ballooning degeneration (<a href="#f0015">Fig. 6.2</a> ). This differs from the feathery degeneration of cholestasis, in which the cytoplasm has a reticular pattern (<b>see</b><a href="#f0020">Fig. 5.3</a>), and from the ballooning in steatohepatitis where the cytoplasm is less granular and more oedematous and ‘clarified’ (<b>see</b><a href="#f0055">Fig. 7.10C</a>). Other hepatocytes undergo apoptosis, which is an important method of cell death in hepatitis.<a href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a> Shrinkage and increased staining of the cytoplasm, sometimes called acidophilic change or degeneration, is probably a precursor of apoptosis, in which the hepatocytes shrink further, become very dense and undergo fragmentation. The apoptotic bodies seen lying free in the sinusoids represent the largest fragments or entire unfragmented apoptotic cells (<a href="#f0015">Fig. 6.2</a>). They are also called acidophil bodies or Councilman bodies, Councilman having first described them in yellow fever<a href="#bib15">15.</a>, <a href="#bib16">16.</a> (<a href="#f0020">Fig. 6.3</a> ). Apoptotic bodies sometimes contain pyknotic nuclear remnants and often appear to bulge beyond the plane of the section. Another form of hepatocellular damage in acute hepatitis is focal (spotty) necrosis, in which liver-cell plates are disrupted or replaced by small groups of lymphocytes and macrophages. Whether these mark a site of necrosis or of apoptosis is not clear; the damage to hepatocytes is deduced from their absence rather than seen. Whatever its mechanism, loss of hepatocytes or liver-cell drop-out, coupled with focal regeneration, leads to a characteristic irregularity of the liver-cell plates, which usually allows acute hepatitis to be distinguished from hepatocellular damage secondary to cholestasis. The loss of hepatocytes also leads to condensation of the extracellular matrix, best seen in reticulin preparations (<a href="#f0025">Fig. 6.4</a> ). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.2</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis.</p> <p>Normal liver-cell plate structure is disrupted.

When syncytial giant hepatocytes are very prominent, the term giant-cell hepatitis is appropriate.<a href="#bib17">17.</a>, <a href="#bib18">18.</a> This is only rarely of proven viral origin and is also more characteristic of acute hepatitis in neonates.

It is a result of damage to the bile-secretory apparatus of the hepatocytes, but may also result from interference with bile flow at the level of the portal tracts.<a href="#bib24"><sup>24</sup></a> The term cholestatic hepatitis is best kept as a clinical description of patients with a prolonged cholestatic course. Mild hepatocellular siderosis or steatosis is occasionally seen. </p> </div> <div class="theinflammatoryinfiltrate" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
The inflammatory infiltrate</div> <p id="p0050">Unlike classic acute inflammation, viral hepatitis is characterised by a mainly lymphocytic infiltrate within the parenchyma and portal tracts. In acute hepatitis, the most conspicuous inflammation is usually perivenular. The extent of portal inflammation is very variable, and portal tracts may be either normal in size or expanded. The larger conducting tracts are often spared. The edges of small portal tracts may be well defined or blurred by outward extension of the infiltrate. This so-called spillover resembles the interface hepatitis of chronic hepatitis (<b>Ch. 9</b>) and may be difficult to distinguish from it. The parenchymal changes, clinical history and virological findings usually make the correct diagnosis clear.</p> <p id="p0055">While most of the infiltrating cells in acute hepatitis are small T lymphocytes,<a href="#bib25"><sup>25</sup></a> plasma cells may also be prominent,<a href="#bib26"><sup>26</sup></a> and there are often a few neutrophils and eosinophils. The plasma cells do not necessarily indicate autoimmune hepatitis, nor do a few eosinophils prove a diagnosis of drug injury. Kupffer cells and other macrophages accumulate and enlarge, many of them forming discrete clumps together with lymphocytes. They may contain tan-brown ceroid pigment, staining with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) agent after diastase digestion (<a href="#f0030">Fig. 6.5</a> ). They may also contain stainable iron (<a href="#f0035">Fig. 6.6</a> ), but this is less common. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.5</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis.</p> <p>Macrophages contain diastase periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive material.</p>   </div> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.6</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis.</p> <p>Enlarged macrophages are strongly iron positive. Some endothelial cells also contain dense Perls’ stain-positive granules. (Section kindly provided by Dr Susan Davies, Cambridge, UK.)</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="p0060">Sinusoidal and venular endothelial cells also take part in the hepatitic process. Sinusoidal endothelial cells become swollen and may contain dense iron-positive granules<a href="#bib27"><sup>27</sup></a> (<a href="#f0035">Fig. 6.6</a>). Terminal hepatic venules may show disruption of the endothelium and lymphocytic infiltration.</p> </div> <div class="portalchanges" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Portal changes</div> <p id="p0065">In contrast to chronic hepatitis, the parenchymal changes dominate the picture, but there is always some portal inflammation, affecting most or all of the small portal tracts (<a href="#f0040">Fig. 6.7</a> ). The density of the infiltrate varies. Interlobular bile ducts may show abnormalities, including irregularity, crowding and stratification of the epithelium, cytoplasmic vacuolation and infiltration by lymphocytes (<a href="#f0045">Fig. 6.8</a> ). These changes, together with formation of dense lymphoid structures (aggregates and follicles), are most often seen in hepatitis C. Bile-duct loss (ductopenia) is very rare. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.7</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis.</p> <p>A portal tract is infiltrated by inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes. In places the infiltrate extends a short way into the adjacent parenchyma.</p>   </div> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.8</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis.</p> <p>Bile-duct epithelium is irregular and infiltrated by lymphocytes. The upper duct profile shows epithelial atrophy and dilatation.</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="histologicalvariants" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Histological variants</div> <p id="p0070">The histological changes in acute hepatitis are infinitely variable, but a few patterns deserve special mention. These are confluent necrosis, bridging necrosis, necrosis of entire lobules and periportal necrosis.</p> <p id="p0075"><b>Confluent necrosis</b> signifies death of a substantial area of the parenchyma. Focal as opposed to zonal areas of confluent necrosis haphazardly distributed in relation to lobular zones are more likely to be due to causes other than acute viral hepatitis; possibilities to be considered include opportunistic infections with herpes simplex or zoster viruses and lymphoma. <b>Bridging necrosis</b> (<a href="#f0055">Fig. 6.10</a>, <a href="#f0050">Fig. 6.9</a><b>, and see</b><a href="#f0045">Fig. 4.8</a>) is the term given to confluent necrosis linking terminal venules to portal tracts. A possible explanation for this location is that it represents the entire zone 3 of an acinus, a view supported by the curved shape of many bridges. Bridging necrosis is a manifestation of severe acute hepatitis, but its distribution even within a single biopsy may be irregular. Necrosis and inflammation linking adjacent portal tracts without involvement of terminal venules should not strictly be called bridging because it almost certainly has different pathogenetic significance; it results from widening of portal tracts, with or without periportal necrosis. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.10</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis: bridging necrosis.</p> <p>Recent collapse following confluent necrosis is seen as condensation of reticulin, mimicking fibrosis.</p>   </div> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.9</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis: bridging necrosis.</p> <p>Two curved lines of collapse (arrows) extend from a portal tract (P).

In making the important distinction between them, the pathologist is often helped by stains for elastic tissue. Unlike stains for collagens, these normally give negative results in the parenchyma, but elastic tissue accumulates as septa age.<a href="#bib28"><sup>28</sup></a> Recent collapse is therefore negative (<a href="#f0060">Fig. 6.11</a> ), whereas old septa are positive. Substantial amounts of elastic tissue take months or years to accumulate, but small amounts can be detected by sensitive methods such as Victoria blue as early as 1 or 2 months after onset of hepatitis.<a href="#bib29"><sup>29</sup></a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.11</span></a></div>   <p>Acute hepatitis: bridging necrosis.</p> <p>The field is the same as that shown in <a href="#f0055">Fig. 6.10</a>.

Inset: This contrasts with an elastic fibre-rich septum in chronic liver disease.</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="p0085">In a minority of patients with acute viral hepatitis, confluent necrosis extends throughout entire lobules or acini (<b>panlobular</b> or <b>panacinar necrosis</b>) or several adjacent ones (<b>multilobular</b> or <b>multiacinar necrosis</b>). This is a common feature in patients with fulminant hepatitis. The term ‘massive necrosis’ is also sometimes used, but can be misleading in so far as a needle biopsy specimen may not be representative of the liver as a whole and can lead to over- or underestimation of the true extent of liver damage.<a href="#bib30"><sup>30</sup></a> This throws doubt on the usefulness of liver biopsy as a means of assessing prognosis in severe acute hepatitis. Sometimes multilobular necrosis involves only the subcapsular zone, and a small needle specimen may then give a falsely pessimistic picture (<b>see</b><b>Fig. 1.3</b>). In multilobular necrosis the parenchyma is replaced by collapsed stroma, inflammatory cells and activated macrophages (<a href="#f0065">Fig. 6.12</a> ). Around the surviving portal tracts there are prominent duct-like structures, some of which probably represent proliferation of pluripotential progenitor cells<a href="#bib31">31.</a>, <a href="#bib32">32.</a>, <a href="#bib33">33.</a> (<b>see</b><a href="#f0070">Fig. 4.13D</a>). ‘Late-onset hepatic failure’ is a term used for patients developing encephalopathy between 8 and 24 weeks after onset of symptoms.<a href="#bib34"><sup>34</sup></a> Study of liver biopsies and explanted livers from these patients has shown a consistent pattern of map-like necrosis together with areas of nodular regeneration. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6.12</span></a></div>   <p>Acute viral hepatitis: multilobular necrosis.</p> <p>Portal tracts (P) can be identified, but the parenchyma has been replaced by inflammatory cells, necrotic debris and duct-like structures.</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="p0090">Periportal necrosis rather than the more usual perivenular necrosis is a feature in some patients with hepatitis A (discussed later).</p> </div> </div> <div class="individualcausesofviralhepatitis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Individual causes of viral hepatitis</div> <p id="p0095">There are more similarities than differences between hepatitis types A, B, C, D and E, but certain patterns are more common in one type than another and are described here. They do not allow the pathologist to identify the cause of the hepatitis on histological appearance alone.

Hepatitis B</div> <p id="p0105">The histological appearances are broadly similar to those of other forms of viral hepatitis. Some of the differences reported in the literature may well reflect patient selection rather than features specific for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, lymphocytes and macrophages sometimes lie in close contact with hepatocytes (peripolesis) or even invaginate them deeply (emperipolesis), which probably reflects the immunological nature of the cell damage. In a comparative study, periportal inflammation tended to be more severe in acute hepatitis B than in hepatitis C.<a href="#bib41"><sup>41</sup></a> Liver cells and their nuclei may show a moderate degree of pleomorphism. In most cases of acute hepatitis, the hepatitis B core and surface antigens (HBcAg and HBsAg) are either not demonstrable or very sparse, but in one study of livers infected with an HBV mutant,<a href="#bib42"><sup>42</sup></a> HBsAg could be demonstrated by immunostaining in over half of the patients and HBcAg in a minority. The presence of ground-glass hepatocytes (<b>Ch. 9</b>) or positive staining of surface material with Victoria blue or orcein indicates chronic disease. Recurrence of HBV infection after liver transplantation is an exception to this rule, both antigens being found in large amounts (<b>see</b><b>Ch. 16</b>). In parenterally transmitted hepatitis, including types B and C, birefringent spicules of talc may be found in portal tracts as a result of intravenous drug abuse.<a href="#bib42"><sup>42</sup></a></p> <p id="p0110">Following clinical recovery of acute hepatitis B, occult infection and mild histological abnormalities including portal inflammation, focal necrosis, apoptosis and fibrosis may persist for at least a decade.<a href="#bib43"><sup>43</sup></a></p> <p id="p0115"><b>Reactivation</b> of a previously occult or quiescent chronic hepatitis B infection may cause changes closely resembling acute hepatitis. In such instances the presence of (1) portal tract lymphoid aggregates, (2) significant lymphoplasmacytic interface hepatitis, (3) any evidence of fibrosis on connective tissue stains and (4) substantial positivity of HBsAg in hepatocytes on immunostaining points to the underlying chronicity of the process.</p> </div> <div class="hepatitisc" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Hepatitis C</div> <p id="p0120">Usually the histological features of hepatitis C are those of any acute hepatitis, but two distinguishing features have been noted. First, there may be prominent infiltration of sinusoids by lymphocytes in the absence of severe liver-cell damage,<a href="#bib44"><sup>44</sup></a> giving rise to a picture reminiscent of infectious mononucleosis (<a href="#f0085">Fig. 6.16</a> ). Second, lymphoid follicles and bile-duct damage, features also associated with chronic hepatitis, may be seen within a few weeks or months of onset.<a href="#bib45"><sup>45</sup></a> There may be cholestasis. The common finding of steatosis in hepatitis C is discussed in <b>Chapter 9</b>.

The antigen, HDAg, can easily be demonstrated immunohistochemically in paraffin sections and is mainly found in hepatocyte nuclei (<a href="#f0090">Fig. 6.17</a> ).

Hepatitis E virus LBI-10</div> <p id="p0135">Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an RNA virus with eight currently described genotypes, five of which can infect humans (genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7).<a href="#bib57">57.</a>, <a href="#bib101">58a.</a> Genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to higher primates and humans and are associated with epidemic outbreaks and an oral-faecal transmission mode, while genotypes 3-8 show a broad mammalian phylogenetic reservoir including pigs, boar, deer, rodents, ferrets, bats, cattle, sheep, foxes, dromedary camels and horses and cause zoonotic, autochthonous (i.e., acquired regionally) infections, typically through poorly or undercooked meat.<a href="#bib102">58b.</a>, <a href="#bib103">58c.</a> HEV has caused epidemics in Asia and has also been found in Africa, North and South America and Europe.

Differential diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis</div> <p id="p0145">The distinction of acute hepatitis from bile-duct obstruction rests mainly on the finding of typical hepatitic changes in the parenchyma. The portal tract oedema of duct obstruction is absent. Drug-related hepatitis may be indistinguishable from viral hepatitis and should always be suspected if the cause of the hepatitis is in doubt. Features more common in drug-induced than in viral hepatitis include sharply defined perivenular necrosis, granulomas, bile-duct damage, abundant neutrophils or eosinophils and a poorly developed portal inflammatory reaction. Cholestasis may overshadow the hepatitic features. Autoimmune hepatitis may have a clinically acute onset, histologically indistinguishable from viral hepatitis or alternatively with histological features of chronic disease. This is discussed more fully in <b>Chapter 9</b>. In steatohepatitis there is usually conspicuous fatty change. Mallory bodies may be present in ballooned hepatocytes, and the infiltrate typically includes neutrophils. The key to the diagnosis is the presence of pericellular fibrosis in affected areas. The differentiation of acute from chronic hepatitis is briefly discussed under bridging necrosis in <b>Chapter 4</b>. While the parenchymal changes predominate in acute hepatitis, especially in perivenular areas, portal and periportal changes predominate in chronic disease. The distinction is sometimes difficult to make, especially when extensive lobular changes are found during an exacerbation of chronic hepatitis or in reactivated chronic hepatitis B, as described earlier.</p> </div> <div class="fateandmorphologicalsequelaeofacuteviralhepatitis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
