 <p>Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, specifically those transmitted by 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a continued public health threat worldwide. Many of these viruses lack vaccines or therapeutics and current mosquito control strategies are underperforming. For these reasons, identifying vulnerabilities within the transmission cycle that can be targeted will be critical to the development of novel control interventions. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway and previous studies manipulating this pathway have shown promise in minimizing viral infections in mammalian hosts. In this study we examined arbovirus-autophagy interactions within mosquito cells. The goal was to elucidate the role of autophagy during infection of these cells in hopes of identifying critical interactions that can be targeted by novel approaches to block infection of and transmission by vector mosquitoes.
