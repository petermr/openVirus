 <p>This work would have not been possible without the dedication and commitment of the Caribbean Primate Research Center and the Animal Resources Center staff. We also acknowledge the efforts of all persons that in the aftermath of the hurricane Maria showed a high level of resilience making possible to advance the science in awkward situations. Authors recognize the support provided by Dr. Elmer Rodriguez reviewing the statistics and by Dr. Willy Ramos for the useful review of the immunology data.</p>
