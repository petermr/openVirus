Current WHO recommendations suggest transitioning to dolutegravir-based (adults) or raltegravir-based-regimens (neonates) for initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) and as a suitable alternative in cases of multi-resistance in resource-limited settings. This review aims at synthesizing the current knowledge on dolutegravir use and integrase resistance-associated mutations found before the wide use of dolutegravir-based regimens.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This systematic review will include randomized and non-randomized trials, cohort, and cross-sectional studies published on dolutegravir use or integrase resistance-associated mutations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Searches will be conducted (from 2007 onwards) in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILAC), Web of Science, African Journals Online, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Hand searching of the reference lists of relevant reviews and trials will be conducted and we will also look for conference abstracts. We will include studies of adults and/or children exposed to integrase inhibitors-based therapies; especially dolutegravir or raltegravir (which is our intervention of interest as compared to other antiretroviral regimens). We will exclude studies of patients with specific co-morbidities such as tuberculosis or opportunistic infections. Primary outcomes will be &#x0201c;the rate of viral suppression&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;the level of drug resistance&#x0201d; on integrase inhibitor-based regimens among patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. Secondary outcomes will be &#x0201c;the effect of baseline viremia on viral suppression,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;the effect of treatment duration on viral suppression,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;the proportion of patients with immune recovery,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;the rate of non-adherence,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;rate of adverse events;&#x0201d; &#x0201c;drug resistance according to different integrase inhibitor-based regimens,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;drug resistance according to viral subtypes/recombinants.&#x0201d; Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, assess the full texts for eligibility, and extract data. If data permits, random effects models will be used where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g., age, sex, baseline viremia, CD4 following treatment, treatment duration, and adherence level).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This review will help to strengthen evidence on the effectiveness of integrase strand transfer inhibitors by contributing to current knowledge on the use of dolutegravir and/or raltegravir (especially for neonates) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Results will therefore help in setting-up baseline data for an optimal management of people living with HIV as Sub-Saharan African countries are transitioning to dolutegravir-based regimens. Evidence will also support HIV/AIDS programs in identifying gaps and actions to be undertaken for improved long-term care and treatment of people living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Systematic review registration</title><p id="Par4">PROSPERO CRD42019122424</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>Integrase</kwd><kwd>Dolutegravir</kwd><kwd>Drug resistance</kwd><kwd>Sub-Saharan Africa</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par28">Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) are the latest approved drug class to treat human immune-deficiency virus (HIV) infection. INSTI stop antiretroviral activity by blocking the integration of HIV proviral DNA into the genetic material of host cells. There are currently five drugs in this class; raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (EVG), dolutegravir (DTG), cabotegravir (CAB), bictegravir (BIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These INSTIs are highly effective in both treatment-na&#x000ef;ve as well as in treatment-experienced individuals who may harbor multi-drug resistance to other drug classes, with a superior efficacy of DTG, CAB, and BIC both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These latter molecules are known as second generation while RAL and EVG are first-generation INSTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the group of second-generation INSTI, BIC has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and exist only as part of the fixed dose combination bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/3TC/TAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CAB on its part exists in several formulations and co-formulations and is still in the process for FDA approval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. DTG revealed however a slight greater efficacy over other INSTI, due to its low minimal inhibitory concentration, limited risk of cross-resistance with RAL and EVG, better drug tolerance, fewer drug interactions, higher potency, and genetic barrier to resistance than first-generation INSTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The &#x0201c;Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection&#x0201d; published in 2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO) clearly recommends early treatment initiation and the use of better-tolerated regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the ability of HIV to mutate in the course of a failing ART prompts the development of HIV drug resistance and the need of new/more active antiretrovirals such as INSTI. In spite of these benefits, INSTIs and especially DTG are also known to be subject to viral resistance. Of note, more than 40 substitutions have been associated with the development of resistance to INSTIs in HIV-1 B subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most prevalent mutations are at positions 66, 92, 143, 147, 148, and 155 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] in the integrase coding region of HIV-1. Of note, G118R is a mutation that has rarely been observed in subtype B viruses, and could have an alternative pathway for DTG-resistance selection in non-subtype B viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, R263K is preferentially selected among subtype B viruses as compared to other viral subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As viral subtypes (especially B and C) are known to have differential mechanisms in the selection of drug resistance mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], natural polymorphisms in the integrase region may influence the development of resistance against integrase inhibitors in different HIV-1 subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in particular carries the greatest burden of HIV infection (70% of the global HIV epidemics) with increasing drug resistance burden (about 1/3 of patients). Also, SSA has a very broad HIV genetic diversity (including both types 1 and 2), with an important predominance of HIV-1 non-subtype B viruses that might affect the clinical outcomes in patient management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several findings support that early treatment with DTG may reduce the emergence of HIV-1 drug resistance (HIVDR) in resource-limited settings (RLS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These evidences are in line with the WHO recommendations on transitioning to DTG-based regimens for initial option or alternative ART in case of multi-resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Up-to-date, few African countries carried out studies on INSTI-resistance. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has been done previously to assess the level of resistance to integrase inhibitors across the continent. There is henceforth a need to synthesize the entire knowledge available on integrase resistance-associated mutations found in SSA before the massive adoption of DTG-based regimens. This would help identify the gaps and actions to be undertaken for improved care, follow-up and management of people living with HIV in SSA. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight integrase resistance-associated mutations (i.e., mutations conferring a poor response to an INSTI-based regimen) commonly found in SSA in patients under DTG (or INSTI)-containing regimens. We will first examine the therapeutic outcomes of DTG-use (e.g., viral suppression and immunological response) and the rate of resistance to INSTI among non-suppressive patients. Secondly, we will evaluate (a) the rate of viral suppression according to clinical and biological parameters, (b) the effects of adherence and adverse events on viral suppression, (c) drug resistance and viral susceptibility to each INSTI, and (d) HIV genetic diversity and its effects on acquired INSTI resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par31">The present protocol has been registered within the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42019122424 ) and is being reported in accordance with the reporting guidance provided in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (see checklist in Additional file 1).

A descriptive analysis of study characteristics will be undertaken to explore the heterogeneity of the studies. Summary statistics will then be used to describe study outcomes, including means or medians, and frequencies. Proportions with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) will be calculated for each outcome and presented in forest plots. We will calculate the between-study variance (tau-squared) and <italic>p</italic> values from tests of between-study heterogeneity. We expect substantial between-study heterogeneity, and the focus of the subsequent analyses will therefore be on the identification and exploration of sources of heterogeneity. Finally, we will explore associations that may exist between proportions in countries, settings (e.g., urban, rural), and study outcomes (i.e., the rate of viral suppression and the level of drug resistance) using random intercept logistic meta-regression (binomial-normal) models. These models avoid the biases that arise when normal-normal models are applied to logit or arcsine-square root transformed proportions. Where appropriate, we will use the same models to calculate combined estimates of proportions. We will use the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidences as &#x0201c;high,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;moderate,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;low,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;very low &#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Major findings on INSTI-resistance, drug susceptibility and linkage to DTG-therapy will be summarized in a table. This table will also present the quality of the evidence found, all sorted according to socio-demographic data, clinical, and laboratory parameters. Though the highest quality rating is for randomized trial evidences, they may be downgraded to moderate, low, or even very low-quality evidence. Rating will depend on limitations in study design and implementation, indirectness of evidences, unexplained heterogeneity, imprecision of result, and a high probability of publication bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Evidences from sound observational studies (cohorts and case-control studies) will be graded as low quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, if such studies yield large effects and there is no obvious bias explaining those effects, we would rate the evidences as moderate or&#x02014;if the effect is large enough&#x02014;even high quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Detailed interpretation of each evidence and its respective recommendation is provided in Additional file 3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional analysis</title><p id="Par63">Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted following the stratification of the study participants. Results will then be sorted according to age (adults/adolescents vs. children [&#x0003c; 10&#x02009;years]), sex (male vs. female), baseline viremia, level of CD4 following treatment, INSTI-based regimens, adherence level, and adverse reactions. This will allow us to adjust for potential confounders, to better estimate the effect of each variable on the observed outcomes. If data permits, meta-regression will be performed and summary estimates will help explore the relationship between study-covariates and effect size, in order to highlight any statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Dealing with missing data</title><p id="Par64">If data are missing in key variables, we will contact the study authors for clarifications.

ROBINS provides a systematic way to organize and present the available evidence related to risk of bias in these studies. ROBIS [RoB 2.0] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will be used in parallel for randomized studies, which include randomized controlled trials.

Our results will firstly be useful for appropriate and contextual management of patients under DTG-based regimens. They would also help to design new strategies in order to improve the care of people living with HIV and reduce the transmission of resistant viruses in the advent of new HIV-infection. This review will thus be highly relevant to inform health system interventions and HIV prevention and treatment strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa, and resource-limited settings in general. As potential limitations of this review, we may be confronted with important study heterogeneity and incompleteness, but these will be considered in statistic models during meta-regression analysis; if not perform, studies incompleteness at least would be solve by contacting study authors. Another limitation may be at the level of reviewing and including studies. In effect, in the process of resolving disagreements while reviewing articles, all team members will be included in the decision-making process or at least aware of the disagreements being discussed. We will try as much as possible to have a consensus decision for each disagreement. Important protocol amendments will be documented, taken into consideration while analyzing the data, and discussed consequently in the final paper. Our findings will be published in a peer-review journal and subsequently disseminated to policy-makers first at the national level through the submission of a governmental notice, and at the international level through conferences and stakeholder meetings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
