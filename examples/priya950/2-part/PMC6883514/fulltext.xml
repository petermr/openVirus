Among these 72 patients, 38 (52.8%) were enterovirus positive and typed as echovirus (18 pediatric and 20 adult cases, median age 18.5&#x02009;years; echovirus 18 (1), echovirus 2 (1), echovirus 30 (31), echovirus 33 (1), echovirus 9 (4)). At the same time, 45 aseptic meningitis cases in our cohort were excluded to be due to enteroviral infection (EV-negative). Three EV-negative patients were tested positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and 1 EV-negative patient for herpes simplex virus 2. Hospitalization was significantly longer in EV-negative cases. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not reveal significant differences between the two groups. After discharge, EV-meningitis resulted in significant burden of sick leave in our pediatric cohort as parents had to care for the children at home.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Voluntary syndromic surveillance, such as provided by the EVSurv in our study may be a valuable tool for epidemiological research.

A large retrospective analysis of a US-American cohort revealed that in 21% of cases the etiology of aseptic meningitis remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Aseptic meningitis is defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] by an inflammation of the leptomeninx in which the causative agent cannot be identified by cerebrospinal fluid culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Viruses are the most common causes of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Viral meningitides are predominantly caused by enteroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which belong to the picornaviridae consisting of species A-D. The main route of infection is fecal-oral, but infestation of the respiratory tract and a droplet infection are also possible. In previous studies, viral meningitis in adults was rather associated with herpes simplex and West Nile virus, whereas children were more likely to be tested positive for enterovirus (EV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, multiple studies have been conducted in order to better understand this phenomenon: A Danish nation-wide prospective observational study between 1st of January 2015 and 30th of June 2016 revealed an unfavorable outcome of viral meningitis in 17% of all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. According to a UK study, the infection rates of viral meningitis are mainly driven by an EV predominance of echovirus 30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">EV meningitis epidemics in Shandong (People&#x02019;s Republic of China, 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) and Finland (2009 and 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]) and the clinical pattern of viral central nervous system (CNS) infections in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have previously been characterized: EV-positive patients presented with fever, nausea and vomiting, were most likely to be children, and had no clear gender predominance.</p><p id="Par14">The treatment is symptomatic, employing analgetic drugs and antipyretic therapy to control body temperature. Pleconaril has been considered as potential specific treatment for EV-associated meningitis. However, it was not approved, given its just modest efficacy and considerable side-effect and interaction profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

The study was approved by the ethics committee, University of D&#x000fc;sseldorf (registry number 4423). We used ICD-10 codes to identify cases of interest. As such, priority was given to the ICD-10 keys A87 and G02 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, as patient data may not have been in the categories listed above due to less precise encryption despite manifest illness, a wider query was additionally performed to identify all patient data encoded as A85-A89 (Other viral encephalitis, not elsewhere classified; Unspecified viral encephalitis; Viral meningitis; Other viral infections of central nervous system, not elsewhere classified; Unspecified viral infection of central nervous system, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and G02&#x02013;05 (Meningitis in other infectious and parasitic diseases classified elsewhere; Meningitis due to other and unspecified causes; Encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis; Encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis in diseases classified elsewhere, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

In our cohort, enteroviral infections were associated with meningitis. The prevalence of enteroviral meningitis is high worldwide (estimated 75,000 cases annually in the United States) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which makes this type of meningitis highly relevant to both caregivers and patients. We were able to show that the rate of infection peaks in the summer and early autumn months (June, July and August; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). With age, the incidence of enteroviral meningitis decreases. Therefore, the incidence is highest in infants and toddlers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which was also the case in our cohort (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">The following findings and assumptions of our study are of significant interest, as they stress differences between EV-positive and EV-negative meningitis and may be of relevance for the treating physician: Overall, caregivers may expect shorter hospitalization times in EV-positive meningitis cases. Furthermore, routine CSF parameters that may already be determined in the emergency unit are not a sufficient tool to discriminate between EV-positive and EV-negative meningitis. When caregivers experience an unusual accumulation of aseptic meningitis cases in the summer and early autumn, patients should be tested for enterovirus infections and cases should be reported to the authorities. Contrary to previous studies regarding viral meningitis in general our data show that EV-positive meningitis is rather associated with a benign disease course.</p><p id="Par34">In adult patients, the disease generally necessitates inpatient treatment for several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. When children are affected, one parent may be incapacitated for a certain period of time to care for the child. In both cases, the disease may be associated with a temporary inability to work (either patient or parent). Because of the high number of cases per year, considerable costs arise for society due to the loss of work and the necessary resources for medical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], although meningitis caused by enteroviruses usually has a relatively benign course.</p><p id="Par35">To the best of our knowledge, the economic burden for society due to EV-positive meningitis has not been determined so far; and our data also provide just a limited insight, since we analyzed the duration of inpatient stay but did not assess any further inability to work.</p><p id="Par36">Our data indicate that the course of EV-positive meningitis is predominantly benign, and that hospitalization time was significantly shorter in EV-positive, compared to EV-negative cases. This was also the case, when we did not consider the above-mentioned meningitis cases that received specific antiviral therapy (varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus 2). Moreover, a higher ratio of affected children and young adults were found in EV-positive cases. This could be explained by affected parents of young, diseased children. Hence, earlier convalescence in EV-positive groups may be explained by differences of age between both groups rather than different courses of the disease in general. In our cohort, routine CSF analysis (pleocytosis, protein level) is not a useful tool to discriminate between EV-positive and negative cases, but CSF protein level may correlate with length of stay in hospital.</p><p id="Par37">Despite the generally excellent outcome of aseptic meningitis, there are rare instances of complicated courses that may lead to persistent neurological disability or even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Strategies for the systematic containment of endemic diseases are focused on ensuring hygienic measures to prevent the spread of viruses, as some weeks after illness, virulent pathogens can still be excreted via the feces.</p><p id="Par38">In agreement with previous studies, enterovirus infections were detected as the most common cause for an aseptic meningitis in our cohort, driven by a high prevalence of echoviruses (52,8%). Indeed, our study demonstrates that voluntary reporting of diseases such as in this case can be an effective tool to better understand epidemiological details of certain diseases:</p><p id="Par39">The mean age of EV-positive patients in our centers was 15 (3.25; 32.75) years, which accurately fits to previous data of Shandong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] (Finland 2009 15&#x02009;years 8&#x02009;months, Finland 2010 17&#x02009;years 6&#x02009;months, Shandong 2014 children within 15&#x02009;years of age). The mean age of EV-negative pediatric patients (8 (7.25; 14.75) years) in our cohort was quite similar to that in a large South Korean pediatric cohort (8.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5&#x02009;years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">EV-positive epidemics are similar in terms of age and gender distribution and other factors worldwide. Overall, this entity remains a rather benign form of meningitis with a rather short length of stay in hospital, but may be associated with complicated courses that may lead to persistent neurological disability or even death. Routine CSF testing (pleocytosis, protein level) may not be suitable to distinguish EV-positive and EV-negative cases, but CSF protein level may correlate with hospitalization. Still, epidemics are a challenge for the health care system. Therefore, we recommend rigorous testing and reporting of aseptic meningitis cases. Within the National Enterovirussurveillance (EVSurv) all pediatric and neurological hospitals in Germany are offered free-of-charge enterovirus diagnostics in patients with suspected aseptic meningitis / encephalitis or acute flaccid paralysis. This health care concept is also well established in the US and led to a concise description of the disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>adj. p</term><def><p id="Par5">Adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNS</term><def><p id="Par7">Central nervous system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSF</term><def><p id="Par8">Cerebrospinal fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EV</term><def><p id="Par9">Enterovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RKI</term><def><p id="Par10">Robert Koch Institut</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VZV</term><def><p id="Par11">Varicella zoster virus</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Jonas Graf, Christian Hartmann, Orhan Aktas and Philipp Albrecht are equally contributing first/last authors.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge support by Heinrich Heine University D&#x000fc;sseldorf.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JG* - study concept/design, acquisition/analysis/interpretation of data, drafting of the manuscript.
