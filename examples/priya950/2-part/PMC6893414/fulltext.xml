However, there are currently no prophylactic vaccines or therapeutic drugs approved for clinical treatments of ZIKV infection. To determine the potential anti-ZIKV inhibitors, we screened a library of clinical drugs with good safety profiles. Erythromycin estolate (Ery-Est), one of the macrolide antibiotics, was found to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection in different cell types and significantly protect A129 mice from ZIKV-associated neurological signs and mortality. Through further investigation, Ery-Est was verified to inhibit ZIKV entry by disrupting the integrity of the viral membrane which resulted in the loss of ZIKV infectivity. Furthermore, Ery-Est also showed inhibitory activity against dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Thus, Ery-Est may be a promising drug for patients with ZIKV infection, particularly pregnant women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>erythromycin estolate</kwd><kwd>ZIKV</kwd><kwd>viral entry inhibitor</kwd><kwd>inactivator</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-11-01064"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne enveloped RNA virus, is a member of the genus of <italic>Flavivirus</italic> in the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. The <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family also contains other enveloped viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, which have resulted in epidemics and threatened public health around the world. ZIKV was initially isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in Zika forest, Uganda in 1947 [<xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and had been perceived as a less harmful virus with sporadically infected human cases, which showed mild symptoms, including fever, malaise, rash, and conjunctivitis. However, since 2007, the threat to public health from ZIKV has steadily increased due to outbreaks in varying places, such as Yap Island, French Polynesia, and Micronesia [<xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, ZIKV has been recognized as an emerging arbovirus and received attention globally. More recently, unexpected outbreaks of ZIKV infection have occurred in Brazil and rapidly spread from South America to Central-American and Asian countries, involving millions of residents [<xref rid="B5-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Meanwhile, the neurological disorders caused by ZIKV have been declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>ZIKV was found to be associated with Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in the epidemics of French Polynesia, and further damage caused by ZIKV, including severe congenital malformation, optic nerve abnormality, and reproductive system injury, have been discovered in recent ZIKV outbreaks [<xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Microcephaly, the most worrying abnormality caused by ZIKV, is a fetal neurodevelopmental defect with resulting physical and learning disabilities, greatly impacting the quality of life of affected children [<xref rid="B11-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As the increasing cases of ZIKV sexual transmission and multiple harmful outcomes to fetuses have been reported, women who are pregnant or trying to conceive are now regarded as at especially high risk for ZIKV infection, and thus the need for effective treatments has become ever more pressing [<xref rid="B12-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. With the increasing recognition of the epidemiology and pathogenicity of ZIKV infection, it is urgent to develop potent therapies. Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutic drugs approved to treat ZIKV infection, although great progress has been achieved. Many potent inhibitors, which play roles in suppressing the virus&#x02013;host interaction and membrane fusion, restraining viral replication and translation, or disturbing autophagy, have been explored and identified in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the de novo development of a novel inhibitor requires drug design and validation, which takes an extended amount of time. Therefore, repurposing FDA-approved medical and pharmaceutical products may become an alternative choice to provide immediately available drugs for patients. Many already-approved drugs have been discovered to significantly inhibit ZIKV infection, but few can be safely used by pregnant women because most are highly toxic [<xref rid="B16-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, the safety profile for pregnant women in the development of ZIKV inhibitors must be considered a priority.</p><p>To determine the ready-to-use inhibitors for ZIKV infection, we screened a drug library consisting of FDA-approved medical drugs with good safety, and erythromycin estolate (Ery-Est), which could be safely used by pregnant women, was found to inhibit ZIKV infection efficiently. Ery-Est, one of the macrolide antibiotics, is the lauryl sulfate ester of propionyl erythromycin (Ery) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), and it has commonly been used for clinical bacterial infections. Besides, some macrolide antibiotics have been studied to treat a wide spectrum of viruses. For example, clarithromycin and the macrolide therapy have been utilized to treat respiratory syncytial virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection respectively, and ivermectin and azithromycin (Azi) were identified to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection [<xref rid="B17-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the anti-ZIKV activity of Ery-Est has been reported. Its antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo were also investigated in the present study. Furthermore, we explored the inhibitory mechanism of Ery-Est against ZIKV.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-11-01064"><title>2.

Ery-Est Inhibited ZIKV Infection in Different Cell Types</title><p>To determine the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est against ZIKV, the plaque assay was used as it could precisely exhibit the inhibitory effects. Ery-Est and Ery of serially diluted concentrations were incubated with ZIKV strain SZ01 at 37 &#x000b0;C for 1 h, and then the treated viruses were added to BHK21 cells, which were reported to be susceptible to ZIKV and develop obvious cytopathic effects (CPE) after infection [<xref rid="B38-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the ZIKV-forming plaques were presented visually by crystal violet dyeing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, numbers of ZIKV plaques were reduced more as the concentration of Ery-Est increased. There were scarcely any plaques formed with the Ery-Est treatment of 10 &#x000b5;M or more, while plaques treated by Ery of any concentrations used in the assay were generally unchanged. This suggests that Ery-Est inhibits ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value of Ery-Est against ZIKV was 3.22 &#x000b1; 0.28 &#x000b5;M in the plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). To test the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est against ZIKV in neuronal cells whose damage caused by ZIKV was especially serious, which would reduce fetal brain growth, U-251 MG cells were infected by ZIKV with serially diluted Ery-Est and Ery treatments. It was found that Ery-Est significantly reduced infection rates of U-251 MG cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 7.14 &#x000b1; 0.96 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>We also developed the immunofluorescence staining assay to verify the anti-ZIKV activity of Ery-Est at three different concentrations, and the results were in accordance with the data from the plaque assay. The expression of ZIKV E protein was almost completely blocked by Ery-Est at the concentration of 10 &#x000b5;M and nearly 50% inhibited at the concentration of 5 &#x000b5;M both in BHK21 and Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). Furthermore, CPE of ZIKV in BHK21 and Vero cells would make cells progress to necrosis and abscission, and their viabilities, thus, could be detected by CCK8, which could evaluate ZIKV infection indirectly. As a result, Ery-Est was testified to inhibit ZIKV strain SZ01 infection with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.55 &#x000b1; 0.46 and 3.97 &#x000b1; 0.09 &#x000b5;M in BHK21 and Vero cells respectively (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">supplementary Figure S1A,B</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that Ery-Est notably inhibits ZIKV infection in different cell types, including neuronal cells.</p><p>In addition, to monitor the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est against viral growth, Ery-Est was tested to inhibit ZIKV infection in a multistep growth curve. It was demonstrated that Ery-Est greatly decreased ZIKV titers (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">supplementary Figure S2A</xref>) in multiple rounds of infection, suggesting that Ery-Est has a strong and lasting inhibitory effect on ZIKV infection. Besides, it was also shown that Ery-Est could exhibit inhibitory activity against ZIKV infection even with relatively higher viral doses (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">Figure S2B</xref>), and viral titers were reduced by treatment of different concentrations of Ery-Est. Treatment of 5 &#x000b5;M Ery-Est decreased viral titers by approximately 80% compared with control group, indicating that Ery-Est remained effective against relatively higher dose infection of ZIKV.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-11-01064"><title>3.2. Ery-Est Inhibited ZIKV Strains FLR and MR766, DENV II, and YFV 17D Infections</title><p>As Ery-Est was demonstrated to potently inhibit ZIKV strain SZ01, we then evaluated its inhibitory activity against other ZIKV strains through plaque assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B, Ery-Est significantly inhibited the infections of ZIKV strains FLR and MR766 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 7.65 &#x000b1; 1.77 and 7.15 &#x000b1; 0.96 &#x000b5;M respectively. Similar to strain SZ01, ZIKV strains MR766 and FLR were approximately half inhibited by micromole Ery-Est, suggesting that Ery-Est could broadly inhibit ZIKV strains that were isolated from rhesus monkeys or patients in different areas of the world.</p><p>Following this, we also researched whether Ery-Est was able to inhibit other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as DENV and YFV. It was demonstrated that Ery-Est potently inhibited infections of DENV II and YFV 17D with IC<sub>50</sub> values of about 1.22 &#x000b1; 0.63 and 2.70 &#x000b1; 1.03 &#x000b5;M respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D). While Ery-Est, on the other hand, showed no inhibitory activity against other enveloped viruses of pseudotyped MERS-CoV and VSV at the concentration range tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>E,F). To rule out the possibility that Ery-Est only inhibits ZIKV prepared in mosquito cells, we further tested whether Ery-Est could effectively inhibit the infection of ZIKV (V-ZIKV) produced in one kind of mammalian cells, Vero cells. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">Supplementary Figure S3</xref> showed that Ery-Est significantly inhibited V-ZIKV infection with IC<sub>50</sub> value of about 3.66 &#x000b1; 0.11 &#x000b5;M, which was similar to the inhibitory activity against ZIKV propagated in mosquito cells. Meanwhile, both Ery-Est and Ery had low toxicity to BHK21 and Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>G,H). These results indicate that Ery-Est may effectively inhibit flavivirus infections with a broad spectrum.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-11-01064"><title>3.3. Ery-Est Inhibited ZIKV Infection in the Early Stage</title><p>To determine which step of the viral cycle was susceptible to Ery-Est inhibition, we developed the time-of-addition experiment with different time points for Ery-Est addition post ZIKV infection. At 12 h post infection, the supernatant was replaced with maintained medium for plaque assay to evaluate inhibitory effects of Ery-Est at different time points. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, addition of Ery-Est to BHK21 cells at 0 h post infection significantly decreased the plaque numbers caused by ZIKV, showing the potent impact on the reproduction of ZIKV. Ery-Est, with addition time from 1 h to 4 h, showed gradually lower inhibitory activity but barely suppressed virus infection from 8 h post infection. Generally, Ery-Est inhibited ZIKV infection mainly in the early 2 h stage post infection, indicating that Ery-Est inhibits ZIKV infection in the early stage.</p><p>Next, to confirm the particular inhibitory periods of Ery-Est against ZIKV, experiments of separate stages that go through viral entry and post-entry stages were carried out as previously described [<xref rid="B33-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Azi, belonging to the macrolide antibiotics as well, was used in the experiment to study inhibitory mechanism of different macrolide antibiotics. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, Ery-Est exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on viral entry, but barely inhibited ZIKV infection in the viral post-entry stage. The result was consistent with above time-of-addition assay that showed the inhibitory activity of Ery-Est in the early stage. However, Azi targeted the post-entry stage in the viral life cycle, exhibiting different inhibitory mechanisms from Ery-Est. As viral entry consists of various processes, including viral attachment and fusion, we developed separate experiments to further explore the inhibitory mechanism of Ery-Est. They showed that Ery-Est significantly obstructed the attachment of ZIKV. Overall, these results suggest that Ery-Est may be an entry inhibitor against ZIKV, mainly suppressing the process of attachment, and the inhibitory stage of different macrolide antibiotics may vary widely.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-11-01064"><title>3.4. Ery-Est Inactivated ZIKV Virons</title><p>The above study of the inhibitory mechanism of Ery-Est demonstrates that it mainly obstructs ZIKV attachment, implying that Ery-Est may bind to viral particles to reduce its infectivity. We, thus, further investigated whether Ery-Est could inactivate ZIKV directly. PEG-8000 was used to separate the treated ZIKV virions from the free Ery-Est after the incubation of ZIKV and Ery-Est or Ery as previously described [<xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The infectivity of treated ZIKV was then detected by plaque assay. Results showed that Ery-Est decreased the infectivity of ZIKV in a dose-dependent manner with 50% effective concentration of 5.21 &#x000b1; 0.85 &#x000b5;M, while Ery showed no inactivated activity against ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). Additionally, other mosquito-borne flaviviruses of DENV II and YFV 17D were also used to verify the inactivated effect of Ery-Est. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>D,E, Ery-Est potently inactivated DENV II and YFV 17D with 50% effective concentrations of 2.56 &#x000b1; 0.11 and 3.46 &#x000b1; 0.41 &#x000b5;M respectively. These data indicate that Ery-Est inhibits virus infections through directly inactivating viral particles.</p><p>It was reported that some ZIKV inhibitors, such as Z2 and human breast milk, could inactivate virus particles by destructing the integrity of ZIKV [<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Using similar approaches, we investigated whether Ery-Est inactivated ZIKV by inducing the release of genomic RNA from virions. Through the RNase digestion assay, we found genomic RNA from untreated ZIKV (0 &#x000b5;M Ery-Est) or treated by Ery were protected from RNase digestion, but the RNA of ZIKV treated by Ery-Est was digested in a dose-dependence manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>F,G), implying the reduction of genomic RNA inside the integrated viral particles. About 80% genomic RNA was digested by the RNase after the treatment of 25 &#x000b5;M Ery-Est, illustrating that Ery-Est may cause the release of genomic RNA to inactivate the ZIKV virions. Next, to further confirm this potential inactivated mechanism, ZIKV with media alone or respectively treated with Ery-Est and Ery, 1% DMSO, and Triton X-100 was centrifuged through the sucrose density gradient as previously described [<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B35-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Western blot was used to measure the E protein of ZIKV in each fraction of the above four treated groups, and RT-qPCR was used for genomic RNA detection. Through the percent analysis of each fraction, ZIKV E protein and genomic RNA of Ery, DMSO, and ZIKV (media alone) groups were consistently distributed in the fourth to sixth fractions, but that of Ery-Est and Triton X-100 groups were separated and the E protein was mainly concentrated in the first fraction, while the genomic RNA was almost distributed in the fourth to sixth fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>H,I), implying the destruction of viral integrity. These results indicate that Ery-Est may inhibit ZIKV infection by destructing the viral integrity, resulting in the release of genomic RNA.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-11-01064"><title>3.5. Ery-Est Protected A129 Mice from Lethal ZIKV Challenge</title><p>As the results in vitro demonstrated that Ery-Est displayed significant anti-ZIKV activity, the protective efficiency of Ery-Est in vivo was estimated in an established transgenic (type I interferon receptor-deficient) A129 mouse model for ZIKV lethal challenge [<xref rid="B40-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Ery-Est and Ery were tested at a concentration of 50 mg/kg once a day for consecutive 7 days. The viral RNA loads of sera were measured 2 dpi by RT-qPCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, viremia detected 2 dpi was considerably reduced in the mice with Ery-Est treatment, implying they may present better clinical status. By continuous 21-days observation, we found ZIKV-infected mice treated with Ery and vehicle died within 16 dpi with severe clinical neurological symptoms, including limb weakness, paralysis and tremors. Fortunately, the mice treated with Ery-Est were protected with statistical significance in comparison to vehicle group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), and the surviving mice developed no obvious neurological symptoms. Besides, mice treated with Ery-Est generally kept good weight maintenance and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f004">Figure 4</xref>C), and they showed lighter clinical signs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f004">Figure 4</xref>D) compared to mice with Ery or vehicle treatment. Mice in mock control groups were in good condition. These results suggest that Ery-Est efficiently protects mice from ZIKV-associated neurological signs and mortality. In general, consecutive treatments of Ery-Est showed considerable anti-ZIKV activity, although it played an inhibitory role in the early stage, possibly by inactivating ZIKV virions newly produced from the body and suppressing them to infect more target cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-viruses-11-01064"><title>3.6. Ery-Est Protected Against Vertical Transmission of ZIKV in Pregnant C57BL/6 Mice</title><p>To determine whether Ery-Est could block the vertical transmission of ZIKV, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were infected by iZIKV (mock infected controls) or 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU ZIKV as described previously [<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], followed by treatments of Ery-Est (50 mg/kg), Ery (50 mg/kg), and vehicle respectively. It was demonstrated that the viraemia of mice treated with Ery-Est was reduced with statistical significance in comparison to groups of Ery or vehicle treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f005">Figure 5</xref>A).

Besides, the infection rates of placentas and fetal heads were decreased by Ery-Est treatment.

By using this method, we found a potent inhibitor, Ery-Est, against ZIKV.</p><p>In our study, Ery-Est was demonstrated to inhibit ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner in plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). It was also shown that Ery-Est could still suppress viral growth and exhibit inhibitory activity against ZIKV infection even with relatively higher viral dose (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">Figure S2A,B</xref>), and treatment of 5 &#x000b5;M Ery-Est decreased viral titers by approximately 80% (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-01064">Figure S2B</xref>). It was reported that the peak concentration of Ery-Est in plasma was 5.93 &#x000b1; 2.34 &#x003bc;g/mL (5.61 &#x000b1; 2.22 &#x000b5;M) after multiple doses [<xref rid="B44-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], indicating that Ery-Est could exert antiviral activity and relieve the viremia in the patient infected with ZIKV.</p><p>Ery-Est, one of the macrolide antibiotics, can block the protein synthesis of bacteria and is mainly used for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection and other diverse bacillosis [<xref rid="B45-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the anti-ZIKV effects of Ery-Est had not been previously evaluated at the time of our study. Besides, some macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin and ivermectin, have been previously found to effectively inhibit ZIKV infection. Moreover, azithromycin was reported to not only inhibit ZIKV in vitro, but also to prevent ZIKV-induced lethality in the suckling mouse model [<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the inhibitory mechanisms of different macrolide antibiotics varied, such as Ery-Est and Azi in the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01064-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), probably caused by different effects on viral particles and host cells due to their different structures. Further research about why macrolide antibiotics exhibit different inhibitory mechanisms against ZIKV is needed. As the effective macrolides with diverse characteristics and advantages are constantly discovered [<xref rid="B19-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B46-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], more opportunities for research and clinical treatment can be provided.</p><p>The clinical dosage of Ery-Est for adults is 0.75&#x02013;2 g/day according to the drug instructions, and it was reported to be safely used by pregnant women at the dosage of 1 g/day to assess whether antibiotic treatment could benefit pregnant women with heavy vaginal ureaplasma colonization [<xref rid="B47-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Since it is considered safe in pregnant women, Ery-Est could provide a choice for ZIKV-infected gravida who are most likely to suffer serious consequences of abortion, premature birth, or having a baby with microcephaly [<xref rid="B48-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

The safety profile of Ery-Est for pregnant women and vaginal use, thus, increases clinical options of the treatment and prevention for ZIKV infection. Moreover, Ery-Est was demonstrated to protect against vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice, indicating it may have a good effect on decreasing fetal infection risk or reducing fetal symptoms when used for infected pregnant women.</p><p>In our study, besides the inhibitory activity against different ZIKV strains, Ery-Est was also demonstrated to potently inhibit other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including DENV and YFV. This presents an opportunity for clinical applications to patients, who may suffer co-infections by ZIKV and DENV, in epidemic areas where the viral vector, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, is prevalent. Moreover, it was reported that preexisting DENV antibodies may aggravate the ZIKV infection through an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect [<xref rid="B54-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the phenomenon in which certain antibodies promote the entry of some heterogeneous viruses into host cells [<xref rid="B56-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Modification of therapeutic antibodies may decrease the risk of ADE, but relatively increase the cost of these antibodies [<xref rid="B58-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Ery-Est, with inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of flavivirus, may be the affordable choice for patients with simultaneous infections without the risk of ADE effects.</p><p>At present, many micromolecular inhibitors that target viral binding, endocytosis, and replication against ZIKV have been discovered, but their suppressing activities are only effective when the virus attaches to, enters into, or replicates inside the target cell [<xref rid="B13-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B30-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Through the study of inhibitory mechanism in the paper, Ery-Est was demonstrated to directly inactivate flavivirus (ZIKV, DENV, and YFV). We speculate it probably interacts with conserved sequences in envelope proteins of flaviviruses first and then destabilizes envelope proteins and lipids of the viral membrane. As a consequence, the integrity of the viral membrane is disrupted which results in the loss of viral infectivity. The detailed inactivation mechanism of Ery-Est remains to be further studied in the future. Ery-Est, as a viral inactivator like Z2 that is a synthetic peptide derived from ZIKV envelope proteins, makes it possible to effectively inhibit ZIKV before viral entry and is, therefore, beneficial to treat infectors with viremia [<xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01064" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The viral inactivator, on the other hand, will promptly work once it contacts the virus, which may directly reduce the viral load into target cells. Likewise, Ery-Est may prevent the influx of virions to fetuses. Accordingly, combinational therapies of Ery-Est and other inhibitors with different inhibitory stages against ZIKV may have synergistic effects of improving protection.</p><p>In conclusion, Ery-Est, one of the macrolide antibiotics, exhibits powerful anti-ZIKV effects in vitro and in vivo, and shows excellent safety, indicating it could be further repurposed as a novel antiviral drug to treat ZIKV infection in populations with high risk, particularly pregnant women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Megaprojects of China for Major Infectious Diseases (2018ZX10301403 to L.L.), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81661128041, 81672019, and 81822045 to L.L.), grants from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (2016-27 to L.L. and KY-GW-2017-17 to P.Z.), and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M640341 and 2019T120302 to S.X.).</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-viruses-11-01064"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/11/1064/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/11/1064/s1</uri>, Figure S1: Inhibition of Ery-Est against ZIKV in BHK21 and Vero cells through CCK8 assay.
