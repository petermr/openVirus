It is believed that such interactions occur among cold and flu viruses, perhaps through broad-acting immunity, resulting in interlinked epidemiological patterns of infection. However, to date, quantitative evidence has been limited. We analyzed a large collection of diagnostic reports collected over multiple years for 11 respiratory viruses. Our analyses provide strong statistical support for the existence of interactions among respiratory viruses. Using computer simulations, we found that very short-lived interferences may explain why common cold infections are less frequent during flu seasons. Improved understanding of how the epidemiology of viral infections is interlinked can help improve disease forecasting and evaluation of disease control interventions.</p></abstract><abstract><p>The human respiratory tract hosts a diverse community of cocirculating viruses that are responsible for acute respiratory infections. This shared niche provides the opportunity for virus&#x02013;virus interactions which have the potential to affect individual infection risks and in turn influence dynamics of infection at population scales. However, quantitative evidence for interactions has lacked suitable data and appropriate analytical tools. Here, we expose and quantify interactions among respiratory viruses using bespoke analyses of infection time series at the population scale and coinfections at the individual host scale. We analyzed diagnostic data from 44,230 cases of respiratory illness that were tested for 11 taxonomically broad groups of respiratory viruses over 9 y. Key to our analyses was accounting for alternative drivers of correlated infection frequency, such as age and seasonal dependencies in infection risk, allowing us to obtain strong support for the existence of negative interactions between influenza and noninfluenza viruses and positive interactions among noninfluenza viruses. In mathematical simulations that mimic 2-pathogen dynamics, we show that transient immune-mediated interference can cause a relatively ubiquitous common cold-like virus to diminish during peak activity of a seasonal virus, supporting the potential role of innate immunity in driving the asynchronous circulation of influenza A and rhinovirus. These findings have important implications for understanding the linked epidemiological dynamics of viral respiratory infections, an important step towards improved accuracy of disease forecasting models and evaluation of disease control interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>virology</kwd><kwd>ecology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">RCUK | Medical Research Council (MRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000265</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">MC_UU_12014/9</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Sema Nickbakhsh</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Colette Mair</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Pablo R Murcia</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">RCUK | Medical Research Council (MRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000265</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">MC_UU_12014/9</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Sema Nickbakhsh</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Colette Mair</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Pablo R Murcia</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs3"><funding-source id="sp3">RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">BB/K01126X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs4"><funding-source id="sp4">RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp4">BB/L004070/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs5"><funding-source id="sp5">RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp5">BB/L018926/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs6"><funding-source id="sp6">RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp6">BB/N013336/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs7"><funding-source id="sp7">RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp7">BB/R012679/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs8"><funding-source id="sp8">RCUK | Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000268</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp8">BB/L004828/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs9"><funding-source id="sp9">NSF | BIO | Division of Environmental Biology (DEB)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000155</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp9">DEB1216040</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs10"><funding-source id="sp10">Foods Standards Agency</funding-source><award-id rid="sp10">FS101055</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Louise Matthews</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Richard Reeve</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">The human respiratory tract hosts a community of viruses that cocirculate in time and space, and as such it forms an ecological niche. Shared niches are expected to facilitate interspecific interactions which may lead to linked population dynamics among distinct pathogen species (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In the context of respiratory infections, a well-known example is the coseasonality of influenza and pneumococcus, driven by an enhanced susceptibility to secondary bacterial colonization subsequent to influenza infection (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Indeed, respiratory bacteria&#x02013;bacteria and bacteria&#x02013;virus interactions, and the underlying mechanisms by which they arise, are extensively studied (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In contrast, evidence for the occurrence of virus&#x02013;virus interactions remains scarce and the potential mechanisms are elusive, demanding greater research attention. The occurrence of such interactions may have profound economic implications, if the circulation of one pathogen enhances or diminishes the infection incidence of another, through impacts on the healthcare burden, public health planning, and the clinical management of respiratory illness.</p><p>Early interest in the potential for interference among taxonomically distinct groups of respiratory viruses stemmed from epidemiological observations of the temporal patterns of infection in respiratory virus outbreaks (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). More recently, the influenza A virus (IAV) pandemic of 2009 further galvanized interest in the epidemiological interactions among respiratory viruses. It was postulated that rhinovirus (RV) may have delayed the introduction of the pandemic virus into Europe (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), while the pandemic virus may have, in turn, interfered with epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Clinical studies utilizing coinfection data from diagnostic tests have also suggested virus&#x02013;virus interference at the host scale (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The role of adaptive immunity in driving virus interferences that alter the population dynamics of antigenically similar virus strains is well known (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). For example, antibody-driven cross-immunity is believed to restrict influenza virus strain diversity, leading to sequential strain replacement over time (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Such antibody-driven virus interactions might even shape the temporal patterns of RSV, human parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human metapneumovirus (MPV) infections, which are taxonomically grouped into the same virus family (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, where antigenically distant virus groups are concerned, the mechanisms are obscure, although the variety of possibilities includes innate immunity, resource competition, and other cellular processes (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Recent experimental models of respiratory virus coinfections have demonstrated several interaction-induced effects, from enhanced (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) or reduced (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) viral growth to the attenuation of disease (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It has also been shown that cell fusion induced by certain viruses may enhance the replication of others in coinfections (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>However, despite epidemiological, clinical, and experimental indications of interactions among respiratory viruses, quantitatively robust evidence is lacking. Such evidence has been hard to acquire, due to a paucity of consistently derived epidemiological time-series data over a sufficient time frame to provide well-powered analyses, and the lack of analytical approaches to differentiate true virus&#x02013;virus interactions from other drivers of coseasonality, such as age-dependent host mixing patterns (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and environmental factors associated with virus survival and transmission (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). As a result, studies evaluating virus&#x02013;virus interactions from epidemiological time series have thus far not accounted for such alternative drivers of coseasonality.</p><p>Here, we apply a series of statistical approaches and provide robust statistical evidence for the existence of interactions among respiratory viruses. We examined virological diagnostic data from 44,230 episodes of respiratory illness accrued over a 9-y time frame in a study made possible by the implementation of multiplex-PCR methods in routine diagnostics that allow the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses from a single respiratory specimen. Each patient was tested for 11 virus groups (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), providing a single, coherent data source for the epidemiological examination of infection dynamics of both cocirculating viruses in general and coinfection patterns in individual patients. Using these data, our study addresses the following questions: 1) Is there statistical evidence of virus&#x02013;virus interactions in the temporal patterns of infection at the population scale?, 2) Is there statistical evidence of virus&#x02013;virus interactions in coinfection patterns at the individual host scale?, and 3) Is a short-lived immune-mediated interference at the scale of individual hosts sufficient to induce asynchronous seasonal patterns of infection at the population scale?</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>The Overall Prevalence of Any Viral Respiratory Infection among Patients with Respiratory Illness Is Relatively Stable over Time, Despite Strongly Varying Prevalences of Individual Viruses.</title><p>We first evaluated the total monthly infection prevalences across all viral respiratory infections from 2005 to 2013. As typically observed in temperate regions, the proportion of patients with respiratory illness testing positive to at least one respiratory virus peaked during winter, with the exception of the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in the summer of 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Nevertheless, even during the influenza pandemic, the overall viral infection prevalence among patients remained broadly stable due to a simultaneous decline in the contribution of noninfluenza viruses to the total infection burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Throughout the 9-y study period, because of seasonal fluctuations in the magnitude and timing of peaks in prevalences of individual viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>), the dominating virus varied on a month-by-month basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Temporal patterns of viral respiratory infections detected among patients in Glasgow, United Kingdom, 2005 to 2013.

However, examining whether these are genuine virus&#x02013;virus interactions (mediated at either the host or population level) required us to address several methodological limitations in this relatively simple approach: It fails to account for autocorrelation in the time series of individual viruses, or for potentially confounding factors which might independently explain correlations, and it can produce spurious negative correlations with proportional data or, alternatively, spurious positive correlations with absolute infection counts.</p><fig id="fig03" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Negative and positive interactions among influenza and noninfluenza viruses at population scale.

This framework estimates pairwise correlations by modeling observed monthly virus counts relative to what would be expected in each month. Patient covariates age, gender, and general practice versus hospital origin (as a proxy for illness severity) were used to estimate expected counts within each month for each virus independently, capturing age and typical seasonal variability in infection risk. For example, viral exposure events may be seasonally (anti-) correlated due to similarities (differences) in the climatic preferences of viruses (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and, in some cases, due to age-dependent contact patterns driven by extensive mixing of children in daycare centers and schools (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

We adjusted for the effects of age, gender, patient origin (hospital versus general practice), and the time period (with respect to the 3 major waves of the 2009 IAV pandemic).

This negative interaction may be driven by virus competition for susceptible cells, for example as a consequence of influenza-induced destruction of cell-surface receptors (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and/or cell death (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), or as a consequence of virus-induced innate immune responses, such as the secretion of interferon (IFN), which can cause noninfected neighboring cells to adopt a protective antiviral state (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Such biological mechanisms would render the host resistant, or only partially susceptible, to subsequent viral infection. This prompted us to ask whether a short-lived, host-scale phenomenon could explain the prominent declines in the prevalence of RV among the patient population during peak influenza activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>To address this question, we performed epidemiological simulations of the cocirculatory transmission dynamics of a seasonal influenza-like virus, such as IAV, and a nonseasonal common cold-like virus, such as RV, using ordinary differential equation (ODE) mathematical modeling (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911083116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4 and Table S18</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7"><italic>Methods</italic></xref> for details). Our simulations show that a temporary reduction in host susceptibility to a secondary common cold-like virus infection, a &#x0201c;refractory period,&#x0201d; caused by a primary influenza-like virus infection is sufficient to produce an observable epidemiological impact. For example, a refractory period of just 2 d caused a 23% decrease in common cold-like virus incidence during peak influenza-like virus activity, while a refractory period of 7 d generated as much as a 61% decrease in common cold-like virus incidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Notably, these simulations produced asynchronous temporal patterns of infection qualitatively similar to our empirical observations, such that the periodic decline in common cold-like virus infections coincides with peak influenza-like virus activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><fig id="fig05" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Mathematical ODE models simulating the impact of viral interference on the cocirculatory dynamics of a seasonal influenza-like virus and a ubiquitous common cold-like virus.

Our study provides the most comprehensive quantitative support to date for the existence of interactions among taxonomically broad groups of respiratory viruses, building on earlier work on pathogen&#x02013;pathogen interactions in the context of wildlife (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), childhood diseases (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and community ecology (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). We reveal statistical support for the existence of both positive and negative interspecific interactions among respiratory viruses at both population and individual host scales. Our findings extend the established paradigms that have focused on bacteria&#x02013;bacteria and bacteria&#x02013;virus relationships (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) to the virus&#x02013;virus case and demonstrate that respiratory virus interactions are not only restricted to previously described competitive interference forms (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>By studying the coinfection patterns of individual patients, our analyses support an interference between influenza and noninfluenza viruses operating at the host scale. This finding supports the potential role of innate immunity, such as through the antiviral action of IFN, as early discussions on virus&#x02013;virus interactions had postulated (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Capturing this potentially immune-mediated interference in mathematical simulations representing the cocirculation of a seasonal influenza-like virus and a ubiquitous common cold-like virus, we demonstrated that a short-lived protective effect, such as that induced by IFN (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), is sufficient to induce the observed asynchronous seasonal patterns we observe for IAV and RV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Many factors could contribute to interferences observed at the population scale through the removal of susceptible hosts (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Such effects will likely act on a timescale (on the order of days to weeks) that is similar to our proposed biological mechanism and might therefore act alternatively or in tandem to generate epidemiological interactions.</p><p>We detected a further negative interaction at the population level between IBV/AdV which was not corroborated at the individual host scale. While IBV has a (albeit inconsistent) seasonal pattern, typically peaking in winter months, AdV typically peaks around May. However, because our Bayesian hierarchical model adjusts for virus seasonality on a month-by-month basis, it is not seasonal differences that explain the negative relationship between this virus pair. In the absence of a seasonal driver or a host-scale mechanism, it is possible that the lack of cooccurrence of IBV and AdV is explained by other ecological drivers. For example, convalescence or hospitalization induced by one virus may reduce the susceptible pool at risk of exposure to other viruses, as previously discussed by others in the context of childhood diseases (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Both IAV and IBV viruses exhibited only negative interactions at both host and population levels, although the specifics differed. That they differ in their exact pairwise interactions is unsurprising when considering that these viruses are antigenically distinct, constitute different taxonomical genera, and exhibit different viral evolutionary rates (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), as well as differences in their respective age distributions of infection and some aspects of clinical presentation (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Furthermore, these viruses exhibit inconsistent patterns of cocirculation (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) (see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911083116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S1</ext-link>) and thus their cooccurrence with other respiratory viruses is expected to vary. Based on these differences between IAV and IBV, it is feasible that their ecological relationships with other viruses have evolved differently.</p><p>Of further note is the lack of interaction detected between IAV and IBV, since there is some suggestion from global data of a short lag between their outbreak peaks. However, epidemiological data are inconsistent in that they report both asynchrony and codominance (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). We believe that a lack of confirmation of interference between IAV and IBV is consistent with current virological understanding. These viruses are genetically and antigenically different; although studies have identified cross-reactive B cell and T cell epitopes in conserved regions of the viral genome (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), sufficient natural cross-protection has not been demonstrated (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). It is, however, possible that their ecological relationship depends on the particular strains cocirculating. Further work is needed to better understand how the existence and nature of virus&#x02013;virus interactions varies at the level of virus strains. On the other hand, some evidence exists in support of immune-driven interference between H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our data did not permit reliable analysis at this level of virus differentiation because low and inconsistent numbers of influenza cases were routinely subtyped.</p><p>Age patterns of infection may provide important insights into the opportunity for, or alternatively the consequences of, virus&#x02013;virus interactions. A lag in epidemic peaks across children and adults has been observed in the case of RSV (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Such a lag between ages may influence the potential for interaction with other cocirculating viruses, or it may reflect niche segregation as a consequence of viral interference. Although an interference between RSV and IAV has been proposed (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), a hypothesis recently supported in an experimental ferret model (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), this was not supported by our data. It is possible that such an effect was masked because our analysis did not enable stratification of effects by age, a step that is anticipated to severely limit the statistical power of our highly comprehensive analysis of virus&#x02013;virus interactions. More detailed investigation to address more precisely when, and among whom, virus&#x02013;virus interactions occur will be an important challenge for future research.</p><p>Our study describes positive interactions among respiratory viruses at the population scale. These positive epidemiological interactions were not mirrored at the host scale, which suggests they are independent of host-scale factors and may instead be explained by variables that were not captured by our study. For example, some respiratory viruses, such as RSV and MPV, are known to enhance the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It is possible that we are observing an intermediary effect of secondary bacterial infections, which may lead to enhanced hospitalization with both viruses, rather than a direct virus&#x02013;virus interaction.</p><p>Although not mirrored at the population level, our 72 pairwise tests did detect the existence of positive interactions among 8 pairs of viruses, including strong statistical support for AdV/PIVB following Holm&#x02019;s correction for multiple comparisons. This finding is consistent with a recent, smaller-scale clinical study of children diagnosed with pneumonia, which detected 2 pairs of positively associated noninfluenza viruses (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Plausible mechanisms of positive virus&#x02013;virus interactions include enhanced viral growth through syncytia formation of a coinfecting virus (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the virus-mediated down-regulation of IFN, which may promote invasion by opportunistic viruses (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and the virus-induced release of cytokines such as interleukin 10, which prevents the detrimental effects of dysregulated immune responses and might lead to immunosuppression and enhanced susceptibility to secondary viral infections (<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). That most interactions detected at the host scale were not supported at the population level is not surprising given that interaction effects are reliant on coinfection, or sequential infections, occurring within a short time frame. The relative rareness of interaction events might thus limit their detectability and epidemiological impact.</p><p>It is important to consider that virus&#x02013;virus interactions are likely shaped by evolutionary processes and thus their existence, magnitude, and dominant form (whether competitive or facilitative) may not be static in nature, and instead depend on particular virus strains, as well as host and environmental factors (<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The virus&#x02013;virus interactions we detect may represent a &#x0201c;net effect&#x0201d; of the evolutionary processes (<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) driving the virus strains circulating in the UK population over the 9-y timeframe of this study. It should also be borne in mind that a large proportion of respiratory infections, including influenza, are expected to be asymptomatic (<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and coinfections of some viruses may be associated with attenuated disease (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the form of interaction detected in a patient population, although of clinical importance, may differ from that occurring in the community at large.</p><p>Our study provides strong statistical support for the existence of interactions among genetically broad groups of respiratory viruses at both population and individual host scales. Our findings imply that the incidence of influenza infections is interlinked with the incidence of noninfluenza viral infections with implications for the improved design of disease forecasting models and the evaluation of disease control interventions. Future experimental studies are required to decipher the biological mechanisms that underpin virus&#x02013;virus interactions and their effects on the within-host dynamics of infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s8"><title>Study Population and Dataset.</title><p>Our study was based on routine diagnostic test data used to inform the laboratory-based surveillance of acute respiratory infections in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (the largest Health Board in Scotland), spanning primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare settings.

The method employs Poisson regression to model observed monthly infection counts adjusting for confounding covariates and underlying test frequencies. This framework uses a multivariate normal distribution to model the random temporal variation in the adjusted virus counts, naturally incorporating a between-virus covariance matrix that enabled estimation of virus&#x02013;virus correlations. Through estimating, and scaling, the off-diagonal entries of this matrix, we were able to estimate posterior interval estimates for correlations between each virus pair. Under a Bayesian framework, posterior probabilities were estimated to assess the probability of zero being included in each interval (one for each virus pair). Adjusting for multiple comparisons, correlations corresponding to intervals with an adjusted probability less than 0.05 were deemed significantly different from zero. Crucially, the method makes use of multiple years of data, allowing expected annual patterns for any virus to be estimated, thereby accounting for typical seasonal variability in infection risk while also accounting for covariates such as patient age (as well as gender and hospital vs. general practice [GP] patient origin). We identified significant interactions between IAV/RV, IBV/AdV, RSV/MPV, and PIV1/PIV2.

Of the 44,230 total episodes of respiratory illness, 73% represent patients experiencing a single episode during the 9-y study period, while the remaining 27% represent patients experiencing 2 or more episodes (range 2 to 26; mean = 3 episodes per patient). Retaining the first observed episodes generated 36,157 patient records and 20,703 with complete testing across all virus groups [note that pressures on laboratory resources led to high partial testing during the major waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulation]. Of these 20,703 patients, 6,884 were virus-positive, 11% of which were coinfected with 2 or more viruses. We note that the coinfection prevalence and detected virus&#x02013;virus interactions were robust to the choice of window used to define an episode of illness when aggregating individual samples (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911083116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S19</ext-link> for details).</p><p>We designed our analysis to minimize the potential influence of Berkson&#x02019;s bias&#x02014;a form of selection bias arising in studies aiming to infer disease&#x02013;disease associations from hospital-based case-control data. This bias arises where there is an underlying difference in the probabilities of study inclusion between case and control groups (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our approach was, for each study virus (Y) in turn, to restrict the analysis to patients positive for one of the other (explanatory) viruses, thereby eliminating the influence of the underrepresentation of the virus-negative &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; population, implicit in the patient-based study population. The study population comprised individuals infected with at least one other (non-Y) virus. Within that group, exposed individuals were positive to virus X, and unexposed individuals were negative to virus X. Cases were coinfected with virus Y, while controls were negative to virus Y. In this way, our analysis quantifies whether the propensity of virus X to coinfect with virus Y was more, less, or equal to the overall propensity of any (remaining) virus group to coinfect with Y. Our study therefore infers signatures of virus&#x02013;virus interactions from the nonrandom patterns of virus mixing among the virus-positive population.</p><p>Our analyses adjusted for key predictors of respiratory virus infections: patient age (AGE.CAT), patient sex (SEX), hospital vs. GP patient origin (ORIGIN), and time period of sample collection with respect to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic (PANDEMIC). In addition, we ensured that virus&#x02013;virus associations were not simply explained by independent monthly fluctuations in the response virus infection risk. To do so, we adjusted the total number of infections with the response virus (VCOUNT) and the total number tested (TCOUNT) within a 15-d window either side of each (earliest) sample collection date for each individual observation.

The temporal dynamics of the viruses were distinguished in 2 key ways. First, seasonal forcing was applied to the influenza-like virus (virus 1) via a sinusoidally varying transmission rate. Second, the rate of waning immunity of the common cold-like virus (virus 2) was assumed to be 10 times faster than for the influenza-like virus. This more rapid replenishment of susceptible individuals was designed to reflect the high year-round prevalence and diversity of circulating subtypes that are characteristic of RV infections (<xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>).</p><p>Individuals were assumed to acquire primary infections at rate &#x003b2; (days<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), assuming frequency-dependent transmission, and subsequently transition from susceptible (S) to an infectious refractory phase (I). Infected individuals were assumed not to be susceptible to further infections with the primary infecting virus. Our assumption is that multiple exposures to similar virus strains are unlikely to alter the within-host dynamics during this short period. At the end of the infectious period, individuals entered a noninfectious refractory phase (J) at rate 1/&#x003b3; (days<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

During both refractory phases, viral interactions are captured via reduced susceptibility of influenza-like virus infected individuals to either coinfection with the common cold-like virus (during phase I) or, alternatively, a secondary infection with the common cold-like virus (during phase J). The strength of the interaction was determined by an interaction parameter <italic>&#x003c6;</italic> applied to the transmission rate, whereby <italic>&#x003c6;</italic> = 0 induced complete susceptibility (equivalent to transmission dynamics in the absence of an interaction), 0 &#x0003c; <italic>&#x003c6; </italic>&#x0003c; 1 induced a partial reduction in susceptibility, and <italic>&#x003c6;</italic> = 1 induced a complete loss of susceptibility.</p><p>At the end of the second refractory phase, infected individuals developed long-lasting immunity to infection due to antibodies generated at rate <italic>&#x003c6;</italic> (days<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (R).

The peak proportion of individuals coinfected with both viruses was 0.39% during each simulated season of influenza-like virus circulation. The R<sub>0</sub>s of these 2 viruses assuming a completely susceptible homogeneous population are 1.6 (virus 1) and 2 (virus 2).
