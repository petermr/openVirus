  <bold>(</bold>HMPV) infection and determine the effect of meteorological conditions in Guangzhou, a subtropical region of southern China. We collected 11,398 respiratory samples from hospitalized pediatric patients with acute respiratory illness between July 2009 and June 2016 in Guangzhou. The samples were tested simultaneously for 18 respiratory pathogens using real-time PCR. Local meteorological data were also collected for correlation analysis. Of 11,398 patients tested, 5606 (49.2%) patients tested positive for one or more pathogens; RSV, PIV, and HMPV were the first, sixth, and ninth most frequently detected pathogens, in 1690 (14.8%), 502 (4.4%), and 321 (2.8%) patients, respectively. A total 17.9% (4605/5606) of patients with positive results had coinfection with other pathogens. Significant differences were found in the prevalence of RSV, PIV, and HMPV among all age groups (

RSV and PIV incidence was negatively correlated with monthly mean relative humidity; RSV and HMPV incidence was negatively correlated with sunshine duration; PIV incidence was positively correlated with mean temperature. We described the features of paramyxovirus infection in a subtropical region of China and highlighted the correlation with meteorological factors. These findings will assist public health authorities and clinicians in improving strategies for controlling paramyxovirus infection.
