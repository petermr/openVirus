<p id="Par27">There are potential drawbacks to conducting HCTs in endemic settings, however, but these can be addressed in some cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. First, there may be issues of scientific integrity because it can be very difficult to exclude the possibility that participants were previously infected or are currently infected before enrollment. Although these challenges will make some HCTs in endemic settings problematic, enrolling participants with prior exposure can be scientifically beneficial because it may help devise an intervention that is more responsive to the needs of people in endemic settings. Additionally, in other cases, there may be groups of people within the population who can be reliably tested to ensure they do not have previous exposure. Second, in some locations with high potential for the disease to spread and it is difficult to prevent transmission to others, the risk to third parties will also have to be weighed in the balance. Although Zika virus is asymptomatic in roughly half to three-quarters of those who are infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], exposure to fetuses can be catastrophic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. If an emerging infectious disease was not transmissible to fetuses, then, an HCT of an emerging infectious disease might be easier to justify. Similarly, if a disease was not sexually transmitted and only transmitted by mosquitoes, or if the length of time in which the disease could be transmitted was of a certain and relatively short duration, the risk to third parties could more easily be addressed.
