viral epidemics. The
unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya
virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify
or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV.
In the present investigation, in silico
studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (<bold>5a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold>) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out.
nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible
antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding
pocket of the macrodomain. The 4&#x02032;-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids
displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO)
of CHIKV. Compounds <bold>5c</bold> and <bold>5d</bold> showed docking
scores of &#x02212;7.54 and &#x02212;6.86 kcal mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm
their (<bold>5a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold>) antiviral potential
against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay and was found to be &#x0003c;100 &#x003bc;M. The compounds <bold>5c</bold> and <bold>5d</bold> showed their inhibitory potential for
CHIKV, which was determined
through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which
show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 &#x003bc;M concentration of
the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of <bold>5c</bold> and <bold>5d</bold> to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 &#x003bc;M
concentration
of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in
cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity
of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence
assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research
of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants,
leading to remedial management
to preclude CHIKV infection.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao9b02900</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao9b02900</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cases of chikungunya viral fever are
burgeoning every year. Infections are not only limited to Asia and
Africa; recently, the epidemics of chikungunya have been reported
from Central and South America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Concerning the data
obtained from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme
(NVBDCP, India), the number of infected people identified in April
2018 was 9175, 4875 from Karnataka following 1375 from Gujarat and
966 from Maharashtra. Earlier research studies have shown that there
is considerable resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, which
escalates in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Therefore, cases of
chikungunya viral fever have increased in the continent of Asia and
various parts of the world. The name chikungunya originates from &#x0201c;Makonde&#x0201d;,
meaning &#x0201c;to become twisted&#x0201d;. It denotes the &#x0201c;curved&#x0201d;
appearance of those going through joint ache as a result of chikungunya
infection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spreads by mosquito vectors <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. The common eukaryotic hosts are primates and humans. In humans,
the symptoms associated with CHIKV are nausea, fever, joint pain,
vomiting, rashes, and persistent arthralgia. Clinical manifestation
is one of the bases for the diagnosis of chikungunya infection, but
the confirmation of disease can only be made after laboratory tests.
Suspected cases are validated by positive anti-Chikungunya virus IgM
or IgG results or by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup></p><p>In Togaviridae family, CHIKV comes under the genus Alphavirus.
Alphaviruses are configured as enveloped positive-sense single-stranded
RNA viruses. There are 29 members in the alphavirus genus; some members
of the genus contain several animal and human viruses like Ross River
virus, Sindbis virus (SINV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV),
Semiliki Forest virus (SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
(VEEV), etc. They are furthermore categorized into Old World and New
World viruses reliant on the changes that occurred in their life cycle,
fatality, and clinical manifestations. Basically, the Old World viruses
CHIKV, SINV, SFV, etc. engage the protein nsp2 to downregulate the
host cell transcription, have less demise percentage, and stimulate
arthralgia. The New World viruses VEEV, WEEV, etc. use virus capsid
protein (CP) to downregulate the host cell transcription, have high
casualty frequency, and generate encephalitis.</p><p>Crystallographic
studies and cryoelectron microscopy of different alphaviruses and
their proteins deliver vital information regarding the molecular organization
and the distribution of the virion structural portions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Encapsidated by 240 copies of CP, the RNA genome of CHIKV makes
the nucleocapsid core.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> The grown-up alphavirus virion
(70 nm in diameter) has an envelope, which is derived from the host,
having <italic>T</italic> = 4 icosahedral symmetry embedded with 80
spikes. Trimers of E1 and E2 (surface glycoproteins) heterodimers
build up every spike.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> CHIKV bears a genome
of almost &#x0223c;11.7 kb, polyadenylated at the 3&#x02032; end and
capped at the 5&#x02032; end. The non-structural polyproteins (nsP1234)
are encoded by the 5&#x02032; two-third open reading frame (ORF) of
the genome. The three chief structural proteins (capsid (C), E1, and
E2) are encoded by the 3&#x02032; one-third ORF of the genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> The functioning of non-structural protein (nsP)
promotes the construction of distinct mature non-structural proteins
(nsp1&#x02013;4). nsP1 is the capping enzyme, nsP2 is the viral helicase
and protease, and nsP4 is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has
an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> The role of nsP3 was not very well defined. However, recently,
McPherson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> have reported that CHIKV&#x02019;s
nsP3 macrodomain hydrolyzes ADP-ribose groups from mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated
proteins and the activity of nsP3 mono(ADP-ribosyl)hydrolase is somewhere
decisive for CHIKV replication and virulence in mice. At the N-terminus,
nsP3 encompasses a very preserved MacroD-type macrodomain. The protein
fold in the macrodomain is remarkably conserved, which is present
in numerous plus-strand RNA viruses, and it attaches to ADP-ribose.
Mutant viruses missing hydrolase activity were incapable of replicating
in mammalian BHK-21 cells or mosquito, <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, cells and quickly regressed the catalytically inactivated mutants.</p><p>Despite the increasing number of chikungunya patients, haplessly,
to date, no antiviral remedy or vaccine is available in the market
for the cure of CHIKV-infected patients. Some CHIKV vaccine approaches
have been analyzed, together with inefficient, live weakened, and
DNA chimeric vaccines. However, questions associated with protection
and efficiency have stalled the development of current vaccine entrants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> Besides, drugs testified via in vitro screening of chloroquine,
ribavirin, and arbidol to curb CHIKV progress have failed to produce
noteworthy therapeutic aids in clinical samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> In the recent past, high-throughput
assays have been established to figure out probable inhibitors of
CHIKV. Literature search has provided the information regarding analysis
of 356 natural product molecules and clinically recommended medicines
to counteract CHIKV replicon, and an accompanying test with the surrogate
infection model of Semliki Forest virus (SFV),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> during analyses of 3040 small compounds as inhibitors of
CHIKV nsP2, was also tested by the phenotypic assay protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Still, the problem for the prevention and treatment
of
CHIKV fever is recalcitrant. Therefore, it is necessary to work in
a streamlined manner to overcome this severe menace.</p><p>Flavones
are naturally occurring polyphenolic secondary metabolites that exist
all over in plants. They have shown enormous potential in the field
of medicinal chemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> They are very
beneficial in our daily life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> to boost
up immunity and can be used as a preventive measure for various ailments,
by consuming flavone-rich products such as green tea, fruits, etc.
In our laboratory, we had prepared naturally occurring rugosaflavonoid
and its derivatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Before formation of rugosaflavonoids,
we had
obtained dihydrorugosaflavonoids (<xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> We had screened these
compounds for tuberculosis in our previous studies, and we found that
halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids were much better antitubercular
agents than rugosaflavonoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup></p><fig id="sch1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><title>Schematic

against CHIKV, mostly natural compounds have been subjected to screening
for antiviral activity to obtain lead molecules using high-throughput
assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> Therefore, in this study, we have checked the antiviral potential
of our compounds against the CHIKV. First, using molecular docking,
the target site for the compounds was identified in CHIKV. The non-structural
viral proteins have a crucial role in the replication and survival
of CHIKV. Among nsP1&#x02013;nsP4, nsP3 has a natural ligand ADP-ribose
that binds to its macrodomain, which is highly conserved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> The docking of these compounds into the nsP3
macrodomain indicated that the halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids
interacted and fitted more effectively in its pocket. This binding
property of halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids with nsP3 invigorated
us to screen these compounds for antiviral efficacy against CHIKV.</p><p>In this study, the docking potential of dihydrorugosaflavonoid
derivatives with the macrodomain of nsP3 and their antiviral potential
against CHIKV are reported. Based on the outcomes of antiviral screening
using CHIKV-infected Vero cells, the dihydrorugosaflavonoids were
assessed with several assays. The cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition
and plaque reduction assays were conducted to determine the inhibitory
potential of compounds on CHIKV replication, and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to assess the reduction
of viral RNA levels in the infected cells. An immunofluorescence assay
(IFA) was carried out to investigate the reduction in CHIKV antigen
upon treatment with the screened compounds.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Chemistry</title><p>The dihydrorugosaflavonoid moiety has three

a very conserved N-terminal macrodomain, and a poorly conserved, not
properly structured acidic and highly phosphorylated C-terminal domain.
The functions of various cellular proteins to influence signaling,
stress granule assembly, and viral replication are controlled by the

various rules were considered but suffered various limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> Therefore, a combination of pharmacodynamics
(PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), which explains the interaction of
an organism with the drug, is important to be studied. PD evaluates
what the drug does to the body, and PK explains how body responds
to the drug. The main
components of PK are absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
(ADME), finally associated with toxicity (ADMET). Although ADME properties
explain the utmost pharmacological performance of small molecules,
the toxicology study
ensures no injury to the organism with no side effects. According
to Hodgson, &#x0201c;A chemical cannot be a drug, no matter how active
nor how specific its action, unless it is also taken appropriately
into the body (absorption), distributed to the right parts of the
body, metabolized in a way that does not instantly remove its activity,
and eliminated in a suitable manner&#x02014;a drug must get in, move
about, hang around, and then get out&#x0201d;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> Haplessly, to address all of these parameters is time-consuming
and cumbersome due to the intricacy of human body, where all of these
parameters affect each other. It has not only limitations to interactions
within the body but also several restrictions due to gender, age,
genetic state, disease, etc. In this case, in silico technologies
can be helpful to compute these calculations based on the mathematical
algorithm used in the in silico software. Although it does not give
full guaranty that it is going to work 100% in the living system,
it saves our time in the selection of molecule to be considered for
further studies. Therefore, ADME/T properties were studied using Qikprop
software of Maestro.</p><p>In <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> values of parameters

vaccine against CHIKV, various approaches have been considered all
over the world to identify the lead molecules restricting CHIKV infection
or replication. In this piece of work, molecular docking of dihydrorugosaflavonoids
with nsP3 showed their interaction with the key residues of nsP3 that
bind ADP, which supports the possibility and indicates that these
compounds are potential antivirals for CHIKV. This is confirmed in
this study by performing various antiviral assays. The CPE and plaque
reduction assay displayed that compounds <bold>5c</bold> and <bold>5d</bold> potentially inhibit CHIKV infection. Further, qRT-PCR assay
results clearly show the potential of these two compounds in the suppression
of viral RNA levels in infected cells. Furthermore, the antiviral
activity of dihydrorugosaflavonoids toward CHIKV is also well delivered
by IFA.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Flavonoid compounds have received many
rewards
by showing their potential in medicinal chemistry. Dihydrorugosaflavonoids
belong to the same class and display their potential to inhibit CHIKV
replication. In conclusion, it could be explicated that halogenated
dihydrorugosaflavonoids with the appropriate modifications are deserving
candidates for additional study to find out the accurate facts of
their mechanism of action and effective anti-CHIKV therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>General Remarks</title><p>All of the chemicals utilized during

(DMSO), and the working concentration was prepared by further diluting
in culture media. At 90% confluency, the media were removed, and media
containing different dilutions of compounds were added into each well.
Wells with 0.1% DMSO were considered as control. After 24 h, MTT was
added to each
96-well in a volume of 20 &#x003bc;L of 5 mg mL<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> stock
and
incubated for 4 h at 37 &#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Upon completion

Cells were treated with compounds 12 h prior to infection (before
infection). At MOI of 1, the cell monolayer was infected with CHIKV
with gentle shaking after every 15 min for 90 min. The inoculum was
discarded, and the cell monolayer was washed twice to ensure that
there is no chance of secondary infection. Compounds were also added
in the post-infection media containing DMEM with 2% FBS for 24 h (after
infection). Infected cells were incubated with 0.1% DMSO as the negative
control. After 24 hpi, the supernatant was collected for determining
virus titer by plaque-forming assay. After collecting the supernatant,
TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added (as per manufacturer&#x02019;s
