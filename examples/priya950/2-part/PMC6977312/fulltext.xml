It was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The virus infects also humans through inoculation after contact with infected animals or through ingestion of unpasteurized or uncooked by-products of infected animals, or also through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals. However, human infections occurred also from the bites of infected mosquitoes, mainly <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic> but also <italic>Anopheles</italic> or <italic>Mansonia</italic>, and other blood-feeding vectors such as flies and ticks have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVFV has been documented.</p><p id="Par42">RVFV belongs to the <italic>Phenuiviridae family</italic> (<italic>formerly Bunyaviridae</italic>), member of the phlebovirus genus. The enveloped virion contains a tripartite, predominantly negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, which codes for structural and non-structural proteins the virus needs to replicate both in mammalian hosts and insect vectors. RVFV attach to cells via the interaction between the viral structural proteins Gn and Gc and C-type lectins, DC-SIGN and I-SIGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cells become infected with RVFV by receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by pH-mediated fusion of virus-endosomal membranes to release nucleocapsids into the cell cytoplasm. Transcription, translation, and genome replication occur in the cytoplasm. The non-structural protein NSs is known to be a major virulence factor allowing the virus to escape host innate immune response. Only one serotype is recognized but strains exist of variable virulence. Moreover, RVFV is classified as a Risk Group 3 agent, and biosafety level (BSL)-3 containment requirements are needed to work with the virus in the laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">As other arboviral infections including dengue, chikungunya and zika, RVF is emerging worldwide, due to the globalization of arthropod vectors, mainly mosquitoes, which efficiently transmit an increasing number of old, unrecognized and new viruses. Arboviruses pose a major threat of introduction to several continents, including Europe and North America, with the possibility of co-circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The widespread presence of competent vectors, the high viral load in infected animals, trade and global travel, all increase the likelihood of RVFV exportation and establishment outside endemic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cases have already been imported to Europe and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and concerns have raised about its potential to extend to other parts of Asia, Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such an introduction would cause significant losses to the livestock industry and substantial human morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Clinicians need to consider RVF in the differential diagnosis for febrile illnesses in a suitable context, however manifestations of RVFV in humans are varied and unspecific including hepatitis, encephalitis, hemorrhagic disease, and retinitis with potential dramatic consequences. The overall case fatality rate is estimated from 0.5 to 2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], but higher mortality rates were recorded, as for example 18% by the Saudi Health Ministry in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], around 22% in East Africa, West Africa, South Africa and Madagascar from 2006 to 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and 28% in Tanzania in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">In 2019 RVFV emerged in Mayotte, a French overseas department and region and gave growth to this work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Strategies of RVFV control appeared us challenging because of its complex biological cycle and its multiple routes of transmission to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Besides, the wide clinical spectrum over a long-period of time made very difficult the establishment of standard definitions of human cases and recommendations for their management. We conducted a literature review on the RVF clinical disease and treatments in humans. We identified the state and frontiers of knowledge. Lacking guidelines on the RVF human disease, we proposed an algorithm to assist physicians on the field in the evaluation of cases. This algorithm could help and be improved during next epidemics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par45">We based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct this clinical review and build the flow diagram (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Literature search and study selection</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12941_2020_346_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

General signs may occur in 50 to 95% of infected cases after an incubation period of 2 to 6&#x000a0;days. The typical presentation includes headache, fever, backache and generalized aches in muscles and joints, lasting 4 to 7&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

RVF differs from influenza, dengue and chikungunya as to whether cough, skin involvement (i.e. rash or pruritus) and arthritis are respectively uncommon signs. A slight meningism at the acute stage is not rare, however its prognosis value has never been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Globally, since the first description of the spectrum of RVF in humans by Laughlin et al. during the major outbreak in Egypt in 1977, it is considered that less than 5% of symptomatic cases will present complications including ocular, neurologic and hemorrhagic symptoms, while favorable outcome will occur within 1&#x000a0;week for the others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this historical series, the different known complications occurred in equal proportions (30&#x02013;35%), but hepatic or renal failures were not identified.

Severe illness included hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or hepatic/renal failures requiring intensive cares. Ocular signs were classified as complications. Ophthalmologic examination should be prospectively performed in all confirmed cases to detect early asymptomatic RVFV ocular signs and evaluate their potential ability to predict the occurrence of neuro-ophthalmologic complications. This should at least include visual acuity determination, intra-ocular pressure measurement, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and funduscopy by indirect ophthalmoscopy. In case of RVF signs, a fluorescein angiography should be performed as well as fundus photography if available. Indocyanine Green angiography has not been evaluated yet in FVR ocular manifestation but could possibly bring arguments for a choroidal involvement since a delayed peripapillary choroidal filling in the arteriovenous phase of fluorescein angiography has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].

There is a global concern about the risk of RVFV exportation in areas where competent vectors are present including Europe and North America. Economic losses, human morbidity and mortality may be significant during epidemics. Infection with RVF has a wide clinical spectrum and may result in delayed complications. There are no commercially licensed vaccines nor antiviral treatment for humans. Human cases are often detected when the virus has already spread among livestock and people, hence outbreak control is challenging. Thus, human case surveillance systems for early detection and correct management are essential to reduce global morbidity and mortality. We proposed a tool for physician guidance on the field. This algorithm should be evaluated during ongoing and coming outbreaks, and could help neighboring places in the detection of cases. We identified frontiers of knowledge and remaining uncertainties concerning RVF which deserves more interest. In particular, therapeutic trials on specific supportive care, antiviral molecules or immunotherapies, should be anticipated to be implemented at the start of future epidemics.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADAMTS13</term><def><p id="Par2">a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARN</term><def><p id="Par3">acute retinal necrosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASPPC</term><def><p id="Par4">acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinopathy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSL</term><def><p id="Par5">biosafety level</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par6">Center for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMV</term><def><p id="Par8">cytomegalovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRP</term><def><p id="Par9">C reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSF</term><def><p id="Par10">cerebrospinal fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT-scan</term><def><p id="Par11">computed tomography scan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EBV</term><def><p id="Par12">Epstein Barr virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p id="Par13">enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par14">human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSV</term><def><p id="Par15">herpes simplex viruses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HVFs</term><def><p id="Par16">hemorrhagic viral fevers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ig</term><def><p id="Par17">immunoglobulin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPC</term><def><p id="Par18">infection prevention and control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IP-10</term><def><p id="Par19">interferon-y induced protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAVS</term><def><p id="Par20">mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCP-2</term><def><p id="Par21">monocyte chemottractant protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p id="Par22">magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MyD88</term><def><p id="Par23">myeloid differentiation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCT</term><def><p id="Par24">optic coherence tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ONH</term><def><p id="Par25">optic nerve hypoplasia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPE</term><def><p id="Par26">Personal Protective Equipment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PORN</term><def><p id="Par27">progressive outer retinal necrosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>qRT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par28">quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RIG-I</term><def><p id="Par29">retinoic acid-inducible gene</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RNA</term><def><p id="Par30">ribonucleic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p id="Par31">retinal pigment epithelium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RVF</term><def><p id="Par32">Rift Valley Fever</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RVFV</term><def><p id="Par33">Rift Valley Fever virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sICAM-1</term><def><p id="Par34">soluble intracellular adhesion molecule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSPE</term><def><p id="Par35">subacute sclerosing panencephalitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLR8</term><def><p id="Par36">toll-like receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>tPA</term><def><p id="Par37">tissue plasminogen activator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TRIF</term><def><p id="Par38">TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-&#x000df;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VZV</term><def><p id="Par39">varicella zoster virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par40">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are very thankful to Julien Ripamonti for his precious help in figures.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EJ made the literature review and wrote the first draft.
