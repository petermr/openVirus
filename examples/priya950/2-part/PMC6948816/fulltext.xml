The timing and burden of the next Zika virus outbreak remains unclear. We used an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of age-specific immunity to ZIKV, and predict the future age-specific risk using data from Managua, Nicaragua. We also investigated the potential impact of a ZIKV vaccine. Assuming lifelong immunity, the risk of a ZIKV outbreak will remain low until 2035 and rise above 50% in 2047. The imbalance in age-specific immunity implies that people in the 15&#x02013;29 age range will be at highest risk of infection during the next ZIKV outbreak, increasing the expected number of congenital abnormalities. ZIKV vaccine development and licensure are urgent to attain the maximum benefit in reducing the population-level risk of infection and the risk of adverse congenital outcomes. This urgency increases if immunity is not lifelong.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Zika virus (ZIKV) caused a major outbreak in the Americas between 2015&#x02013;2017. It remains unclear if immunity after infection offers life-long protection at an individual level and how long herd immunity can protect a population against a new ZIKV outbreak. Data from Managua, Nicaragua showed an imbalance in protective immunity after ZIKV infection across different age-strata. We used this data to parameterize an individual based mathematical model to predict the future risk of a new ZIKV outbreak and to evaluate the effect of loss of immunity and the introduction of vaccination. We found that the 15&#x02013;29 age range will be at highest risk of infection during the next ZIKV outbreak, increasing the expected number of congenital abnormalities. We show that vaccination could curb the risk of infection and could extend the herd immunity, but introduction within the next decade is crucial to provide the most benefit.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320030_176233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1039-6873</contrib-id><name><surname>Counotte</surname><given-names>Michel J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>MJC received salary support from the Swiss National Science Foundation (project grant 320030_176233).

Before 2007, circulation of the virus only occurred sporadically in African and Asian countries [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Between 2007 and 2013, ZIKV caused large-scale epidemics in the populations of Micronesia [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], French Polynesia [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and other Pacific islands [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ZIKV probably became established in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in the Americas between 2013-2014, [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and then spread rapidly across the continent. In 2015, doctors in Brazil started reporting clusters of infants born with microcephaly, a severe congenital abnormality, and of adults with Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, a paralyzing neurological condition, resulting in the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. WHO stated, in September 2016, that ZIKV in pregnancy was the most likely cause of the clusters of microcephaly, and other adverse congenital outcomes [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The risk of an affected pregnancy appears highest during the first trimester, with estimates between 1.0 and 4.5% [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. By the beginning of 2018, over 220,000 confirmed cases of ZIKV infection had been reported from Latin America and the Caribbean [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is estimated to be only 1.02% (&#x000b1; 0.93%) of the total number of cases, based on mathematical modelling studies [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Protective immunity conferred by infection, combined with high attack rates and herd immunity, can explain the ending of epidemics and the lack of early recurrence [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], as has been seen with ZIKV [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The duration of protective immunity induced by ZIKV infection remains uncertain, since immunity to ZIKV infection was not studied extensively before the 2013 outbreaks. Evidence from seroprevalence studies in French Polynesia and Fiji found that levels of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies decrease with time [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. If the fall in antibody levels means that people become susceptible to infection again, population level ZIKV immunity might be declining already. Even if protective immunity is lifelong, the risk of a new ZIKV outbreak will rise as susceptible newborns replace older individuals, lowering the overall proportion of the population that is immune. A modelling study, based on data from the 2013 epidemic in French Polynesia, estimated that ZIKV outbreaks are unlikely to occur for 12 to 20 years, assuming lifelong immunity [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>A direct consequence of population renewal will be an unequal distribution of immunity by age group, with younger age groups at higher risk from a new epidemic than older people [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. That effect will be amplified if ZIKV attack rates are lower in children than adults. Assessing the risk of ZIKV infection in women of reproductive age is essential because ZIKV infection in pregnancy, leading to adverse congenital outcomes, has such important implications for individuals, for public health and for investment in surveillance and mitigation strategies, including vector control, early warning systems, and vaccines [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, no vaccine is currently available against ZIKV. Phase I clinical trials of ZIKV candidate vaccines have shown levels of neutralizing antibody titers that were considered protective against reinfection [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Some vaccines have already entered phase II trials [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but some companies have stopped vaccine development [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Researchers in Managua, Nicaragua were the first to report the age-stratified seroprevalence of ZIKV antibodies in population-based surveys [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The first cases of autochthonous ZIKV infection in Nicaragua were reported in January, 2016, and an epidemic was observed between July and December of that year. Through case-based surveillance, the public health authorities of Nicaragua reported a total of 2,795 people with ZIKV detected by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR over this period [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The number of symptomatic infections is likely much higher, owing to under-reporting. Furthermore, ZIKV infection is asymptomatic in 33 to 87% of cases [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which are generally not identified by surveillance systems. Shortly after the end of the 2016 epidemic, Zambrana et al. analyzed sera from two large population-based surveys in Managua to measure the prevalence of IgG antibodies against ZIKV in 2- to 14-year olds (N = 3,740) and 15- to 80-year olds (N = 2,147) [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The authors reported ZIKV seroprevalence of 36.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34.5; 37.8%) among the 2-14 year age group and 56.4% (95% CI: 53.1; 59.6%) among the 15-80 year age group [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The observed post-outbreak seroprevalence in adults is in line with findings from seroprevalence studies from French Polynesia, Brazil, and Bolivia [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we used published data from the 2016 ZIKV epidemic in Managua and developed an agent-based model (ABM) to predict the evolution of age-specific protective immunity to ZIKV infection in the population of Managua, Nicaragua during the period 2017&#x02013;2097. We assessed: 1) the risk of a future ZIKV outbreak; 2) the consequences of a future ZIKV outbreak on women of reproductive age; 3) the influence of loss of immunity on future attack rates; and 4) how vaccination could prevent future ZIKV outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Modelling strategy</title><p>We assessed the consequences of future outbreaks of ZIKV infection in Managua, Nicaragua using a stochastic ABM.

We assigned agents&#x02019; age and ZIKV infection status (susceptible <italic>S</italic>, infected <italic>I</italic> or immune <italic>R</italic>). Initial conditions reflected the situation in Managua, Nicaragua in 2017, when there was no documentation of active transmission. In the outbreak-free period, we only considered demographic and immunity processes: births, deaths, ageing and, if applicable, loss of immunity and vaccination. Given the scarcity of these events at the individual level, we selected a long time-step of seven days and stochastically applied the transition probabilities at each time step for each agent. After a given time, ZIKV-infected cases were reintroduced in the population. Upon reintroduction, the time step was reduced to 0.1 days, and we evaluated the epidemic-related transition probabilities: Susceptible agents may become infected at a rate <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub><italic>I</italic>/<italic>N</italic>, where <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> is the age-dependent transmission rate and N the total population size. Infected individuals may recover with a rate <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>. We ignored the influence of the vector population and assumed that the force of infection is directly proportional to the overall proportion of infected individuals. We allowed six months for the outbreak to finish after introduction. Simulations were conducted independently for each combination of scenarios and repeated 1,000 times. In the baseline scenario, we assumed no vaccination, no loss of immunity and a reintroduction of 10 infected individuals.</p><p>We implemented the model in &#x02018;Stan&#x02019; version 2.18 [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and we conducted analyses with R version 3.5.1 [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

The risk of a new ZIKV outbreak in Nicaragua, after reintroduction, will remain low before 2035 because of herd immunity, then rise to 50% in 2047. If protective immunity to ZIKV decays with time, ZIKV recurrence could occur sooner. Timely introduction of targeted vaccination, focusing on females aged 15 years would both reduce the risk of adverse congenital outcomes and extend herd immunity, mitigating the overall risk of an outbreak and resulting in lower attack rates if an outbreak occurs.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>A strength of our approach is that it allows for the propagation of uncertainty from the initial data into the risk assessment, by transferring the posterior distributions of the parameters from the deterministic model fitted to surveillance and seroprevalence data on the 2016 epidemic into the ABM used for simulations. Roche et al. showed that, when a sufficiently small time step was chosen, stochastic and deterministic models using the same parameter values led to similar results [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Additionally, we benefited from the availability of high quality data from population-based surveys that included participants from age 2 to 80 years in Managua, Nicaragua. The age-stratified seroprevalence data allowed us to investigate the risk in different age groups and better assess the evolution of the age-specific immunity, which is crucial when studying adverse congenital events caused by ZIKV infection during pregnancy.</p><p>We chose a simple approach based on an SIR structure, similar to the model used by Netto et al. (2017), to focus on the dynamics of infection and immunity in the human population [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We did not model vector populations and behavior explicitly, as in some other studies [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This simplification limits the mechanistic interpretation of the epidemic parameters, but provides a phenomenological description of the transmission dynamics. We believe that this approach is appropriate because our main objective was to determine the risk of an outbreak after reintroduction of ZIKV, which is mostly influenced by the level of protective immunity in the human population. We acknowledge that the future occurrence of ZIKV in the area also depends on the presence of a competent vector. Our choice is supported by sensitivity analyses that show that more complex model structures (delayed SIR and Ross-MacDonald-type models) were not superior to a simple SIR structure in describing the 2016 ZIKV epidemic of Managua (Supporting information S1). Similarly, Pandey et al. (2013) showed that additional model complexity does not result in a better description of the dynamics of transmission of dengue virus (another Aedes-borne virus) in a human population compared with a SIR model [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our model, the transmission rate (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>) captures both human-mosquito and mosquito-human transmission; we assumed a constant transmission rate, as observed in the 2016 outbreak.</p><p>Despite having modeled the effect of migration on our predictions, uncertainty remains; factors such as the political instability in Nicaragua could drive migration and influence disease transmission, as we currently observe in Venezuela and bordering countries [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Interpretation in comparison with other studies</title><p>This study shows that the lower attack rate of ZIKV in children than in adults will hasten the emergence of a population that will be fully susceptible to infection, especially if immunity is not lifelong. The advantage of our approach is that we used the age-specific attack rates to model the processes of ageing in relation to protective immunity to ZIKV explicitly. Even with lifelong immunity, our model predicts that children aged 0&#x02013;14 years will become entirely susceptible by 2031 and 15&#x02013;29 year olds by 2046. In future outbreaks, the attack rate will then be highest amongst 15&#x02013;29 year olds, including women who will be at risk of ZIKV infection in pregnancy. If immunity wanes, the time until the next ZIKV outbreak will be reduced and, in that case, the distribution of infection risk would be more equal across age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007978.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Several authors have studied the time to a next ZIKV outbreak, but none studied the effect of the loss of immunity over time in relation to age. Assuming lifelong immunity, our estimates of the time until the risk increases are similar to the 12&#x02013;20 years before re-emergence estimated for French Polynesia [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Netto et al. (2017) used an SEIR model to show that in Salvador, Brazil, the effective reproduction number was insufficient to cause a new outbreak during the &#x0201c;subsequent years&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Louren&#x000e7;o et al. (2017) showed the same for the whole of Brazil: herd immunity should protect the population from a new outbreak in the coming years [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Ferguson et al. (2016) concluded that the age distribution of future ZIKV outbreaks will likely differ and that a new large epidemic will be delayed for &#x0201c;at least a decade&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Other ZIKV vaccination studies confirm our findings. However, they do not show the effect in risk groups nor assume herd immunity from previous outbreaks as we did; Durham et al. (2018) showed that immunizing females aged 9 to 49 years with a 75% effective vaccine and a coverage of 90%, would reduce the incidence of prenatal infections by at least 94% [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Similarly, Bartsch et al. (2018) showed that women of childbearing age or young adults would be an ideal target group for vaccination [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Valega-Mackenzie et al. (2018) formulated a vaccination model for ZIKV transmission that included mosquito and sexual transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. They found that vaccination works if high coverage is achieved, both when sexual transmission or vector-borne transmission is most important.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Implications and future research</title><p>Our finding that people in the 15&#x02013;29 year age range are more at risk of infection implies that we expect a higher number of congenital abnormalities due to ZIKV infection. Thus, vaccine development efforts should be increased. Our conclusions are drawn based on data from Managua, Nicaragua, but should be relevant to many regions in the Americas and the Pacific that have documented high post-epidemic levels of seropositivity [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In regions where ZIKV has not yet caused an epidemic but competent vectors are present, vaccination would be in place as well. Further age-stratified seroprevalence studies, using sensitive and specific tests and with longitudinal follow-up, are needed to improve our understanding of ZIKV antibody distribution in populations and to quantify the duration of immunity. This information will provide important information to improve mathematical modeling of ZIKV risk.</p><p>ZIKV vaccine development faces considerable hurdles. First, the evaluation of vaccine efficacy has stalled because the reduced circulation of ZIKV has reduced the visibility of ZIKV-associated disease [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Second, it remains unclear if neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination are sufficient to protect women against vertical transmission and congenital abnormalities [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Third, it is not clear whether or how vaccine-induced antibodies against ZIKV will cross-react with other flaviviruses. To move vaccine development forward, we need to find regions where disease will occur to be able to conduct trials. This requires identifying populations that are at risk, and implementing surveillance there. These can either be regions where ZIKV is endemic, or where ZIKV outbreaks are likely to occur; throughout the Americas, there might be regions that did not experience an outbreak, but do have suitable conditions such as competent vectors. Conducting vaccine trials in disease outbreaks is complex, but there are tools to facilitate planning [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. ZIKV in an endemic setting, such as in Africa and Asia, could prove a suitable setting as well. However, ZIKV circulation in endemic setting is not well described and the occurrence of adverse outcomes in this context is less documented [<xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further research in understanding the transmission of the virus in an endemic context is therefore needed. Similarly, we need to increase the understanding of changes over time in vector abundance and population composition, since these influence the risk of new outbreaks.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Preparedness is vital; the time until the next outbreak gives us the opportunity to be prepared. The next sizeable ZIKV outbreak in Nicaragua will likely not occur before 2035 but the probability of outbreaks will increase. Young women of reproductive age will be at highest risk of infection during the next ZIKV outbreak. Vaccination targeted to young women could curb the risk of a large outbreak and extend herd immunity. ZIKV vaccine development and licensure are urgent to attain the maximum benefit in reducing the population-level risk of infection and the risk of adverse congenital outcomes.
