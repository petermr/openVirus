When tested for, the diagnosis and treatment of influenza are often delayed due to the slow turnaround times of centralised laboratory PCR testing. Newer molecular systems, have comparable accuracy to laboratory PCR testing, and can generate a result in under 1 hour, making them potentially deployable as point-of-care tests (POCTs). High-quality evidence for the impact of routine POCT for influenza on clinical outcomes is, however, currently lacking. This large pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial aims to address this evidence gap.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The FluPOC trial is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial evaluating adults admitted to a large teaching hospital and a district general hospital with an acute respiratory illness, during influenza season and defined by Public Health England. Up to 840 patients will be recruited over up to three influenza seasons, and randomised (1:1) to receive either POCT using the FilmArray respiratory panel, or routine clinical care. Clinical and infection control teams will be informed of the results in real time and where influenza is detected clinical teams will be encouraged to offer neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment in accordance with national guidelines. Those allocated to standard clinical care will have a swab taken for later analysis to allow assessment of missed diagnoses. The outcomes assessment will be by retrospective case note analysis. The outcome measures include the proportion of influenza-positive patients detected and appropriately treated with NAIs, isolation facility use, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, complications and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Prior to commencing the study, approval was obtained from the South Central Hampshire A Ethics Committee (reference 17/SC/0368, granted 7 September 2017). Results generated from this protocol will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at national and international conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>

</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Influenza: widespread but underdiagnosed</title><p>Estimates of the burden of influenza virus infection in hospitalised adults have traditionally been based on the incidence of the influenza-like-illness syndrome (ILI, defined as fever of &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C and new respiratory symptoms) which has poor sensitivity (around 50%) and specificity (0%&#x02013;63%), rather than on laboratory-confirmed influenza.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref> Patients may also present as decompensated cardiovascular disease, collapse or diabetic emergencies.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> A recent Canadian study estimated that only around 1 in 14 emergency department (ED) visits due to influenza virus infection was correctly attributed to influenza.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p><p>Sampling for respiratory viruses is generally performed on upper respiratory tract samples; however, several recent studies suggest that in lower respiratory tract syndromes (such as pneumonia and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) testing of upper respiratory tract samples for viruses is insensitive compared with testing lower respiratory tract samples.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref>
</p><p>For these reasons, it is likely that the burden of influenza and other respiratory viruses among hospitalised adults and its economic impact have been vastly underestimated.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Neuraminidase inhibitors</title><p>Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are recommended by Public Health England (PHE) and WHO guidelines for all hospitalised adults with suspected and proven influenza infection.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although there have been no randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of NAIs in this group, well-controlled observational data suggest that the treatment of influenza with NAIs reduces mortality in hospitalised adults, especially when commenced rapidly.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Therefore, it is important that hospitalised patients with influenza are all identified and treated as soon as possible after presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Previous point-of-care tests (POCTs) for influenza</title><p>Rapid diagnostic tests for influenza, based on antigen detection in upper respiratory tract samples, have been available for many years but have poor diagnostic accuracy in adults, where sensitivity is around 50%.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> The poor sensitivity of these antigen-based tests has limited their clinical utility and their use was not associated with clinical or health economic benefits in a large randomised controlled trial in hospitalised adults.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The current gold standard diagnostic test for respiratory viruses is laboratory-performed PCR which is highly sensitive and specific but has a typical turnaround time for results of 24&#x02013;48&#x02009;hours.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> New rapid, molecular tests have recently been developed, including the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel. These molecular platforms are broadly equivalent in accuracy to laboratory PCR, without the need for specialist laboratory support and expertise, can provide a result in under 1&#x02009;hour and can potentially be used as a POCT.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>FilmArray respiratory panel</title><p>The FilmArray respiratory panel 2 (BioFire Diagnostics, Utah, USA) uses nested real-time PCR to detect around 20 respiratory viruses. The FilmArray requires only 2&#x02009;min of &#x02018;hands on&#x02019; time and produces a test result in around 45&#x02009;min.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The FilmArray respiratory panel 2 is both Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared and CE in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) marked. The viral pathogens detected by the FilmArray respiratory panel 2 include: influenza A (H1 and H3), influenza B, adenovirus, coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43) human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza (types 1&#x02013;4) and respiratory syncytial virus.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> The FilmArray respiratory panel is broadly equivalent in accuracy to laboratory PCR, and has been validated on nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, lower respiratory tract samples and on samples from immunocompromised patients.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;30</xref> These studies also show high reliability, ease of use and short turnaround times.</p></sec><sec id="s1-6"><title>Clinical impact of POCT for respiratory viruses</title><p>Though viruses are the most commonly detectable pathogen in adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness, antibiotic use is near universal.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Antibiotic overuse for acute respiratory illness is partly driven by clinical uncertainty regarding the underlying aetiology; therefore, early identification of viruses may prevent or shorten unnecessary antibiotic use. Previous small studies have suggested that rapid molecular viral testing might reduce antibiotic use and improve influenza antiviral use.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> We have recently shown in a large pragmatic randomised controlled trial (ResPOC)<sup>33</sup> that routine syndromic molecular POCT for respiratory viruses (using the FilmArray respiratory panel) in adults presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness was associated with a number of clinical benefits compared with routine clinical care including a reduction in unnecessary antibiotics use, and a reduced length of hospital stay. It also suggested improved influenza detection and antiviral use and better side room utilisation, although the number of patients infected with influenza was small and the study was not powered to evaluate outcomes in this subgroup.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This follow-on study seeks to definitively evaluate the impact of routine molecular POCT for influenza on the detection of patients infected with influenza, their clinical care and outcome. Accepting the unpredictability of influenza activity year on year, this study is designed to recruit larger numbers of patients infected with influenza, and powered to evaluate the impact of POCT on national guideline recommended antiviral use. In addition, the novel use of sampling and deferred viral testing in the control group allows a direct assessment of missed diagnosis of influenza in hospitalised adults.</p></sec><sec id="s1-7"><title>Alignment with global research priorities</title><p>In addition to being focused on patient and healthcare organisation outcomes, this clinical research is strongly aligned with several global research priority initiatives including WHO&#x02019;s Battle against Respiratory Viruses (BRaVe) initiative<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and the UK national report into antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The BRaVe initiative aims to catalyse multidisciplinary research on strategies to prevent and treat medically important respiratory virus infections with the goal of timely integration of research advances into public health practice. Priority areas identified include improving diagnostic tests for viral respiratory illness and improving the clinical management of patients with acute respiratory viral illness, both addressed by this study. With the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance to global public heath, there is increasing need for the research and development of interventions which can help avoid unnecessary antibiotics use.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The data that will be generated by this trial regarding the impact of influenza POCT on antibiotic prescribing is highly aligned with this global initiative.</p></sec><sec id="s1-8"><title>Added value</title><p>In addition to evaluating the clinical benefit of routine molecular POCT for influenza, we will also use this opportunity to answer other important research questions including the ideal specimens for respiratory virus testing (upper vs lower respiratory tract specimens) in patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), the difference in viral load between these two specimen type and whether changes in viral load over time (kinetics) in respiratory samples or the presence of viral RNA in the blood is related to and predictive of clinical outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Study aims and objectives</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aims</title><p>This study aims to prospectively evaluate the impact of a routine molecular point-of-care (POC) &#x02018;test-and-treat&#x02019; strategy for influenza in adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness during influenza season.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Objectives</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To evaluate the impact of routine molecular POCT on the clinical management of influenza including: the detection rate of influenza, the adherence to national (PHE) influenza guidelines, the speed and appropriateness of NAI use and the speed and appropriateness of isolation facility use.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To evaluate the impact of routine molecular POCT on measures of clinical effectiveness in adults hospitalised with influenza including: time to clinical stability, time on supplementary oxygen, duration of hospitalisation, adverse events and mortality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore the differences in viral detection between upper and lower respiratory tract samples and the changes in viral load that occur over time in NAI-treated and NAI-untreated patients.</p></list-item></list><p>Study processes that patient&#x02013;participant will undergo are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Participant flow through the study.

Further nose/throat swabs, sputum samples and blood tests may be collected from patients who remain inpatients on serial follow-up visits up to day 14.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Sample size</title><sec id="s3-7-1"><title>Proposed sample size</title><p>The study will recruit up to 840 patient&#x02013;participants: about 280 per season for three consecutive influenza seasons. With 1:1 allocation to groups, there will be 420 patients per group. On the conservative assumption of a 25% positivity rate for influenza during influenza season (ie, ~100 influenza-positive patients in each group), the group sizes would give a 90% power at a 0.05 significance level to detect a difference of 20% in appropriate NAI use (from 65% to 85%) and an 80% power to detect a difference of 17%. In our previous work, 91% of influenza-positive patients randomised to POCT were appropriately treated with NAI versus 65% with routine clinical care, a difference of 26% (95%CI 10 to 43). We suspect that the difference may be larger in this study as there will likely be a number of undiagnosed (and therefore untreated) cases in the control group revealed by testing them with the FilmArray at a later date. In the event of higher numbers of influenza-positive patients being recruited in the first two seasons, the study may be stopped prematurely (once ~100 influenza-positive patients have been recruited to the intervention group).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Recruitment and screening</title><sec id="s3-8-1"><title>Screening</title><p>Eligible patients in the AMU and the ED will be identified by research staff via regular review of the comprehensive admissions information technology (IT) systems daily. Recruitment will run for up to 3 years to include three seasonal influenza seasons between December 2017 and May 2020.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8-2"><title>Consent</title><p>The study team (research nurse, research fellow or the principal investigator) will obtain informed consent for those fulfilling eligibility criteria and willing to be recruited for those with capacity, or assent via consultee for those without capacity, as per the dedicated study forms. In view of the acute nature of patients&#x02019; illnesses, the potential benefits of rapid identification of viruses including prompt NAI use for influenza, the usual 24&#x02009;hours consideration period for a participant or consultee, will not apply.</p><p>Discussion of the study will be provided to patients, or their consultee for those lacking capacity, by study staff. This includes supply of a participant information sheet for the participant or witness to read and retain. Consent is also acquired to obtain and store specimens (nose/throat swab, sputum sample, blood tests) for future research studies.</p><p>Each patient will be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that they lack capacity. For patients unable to consent for themselves, this study complies with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and in such cases, the patient&#x02019;s family member, carer or friend may be asked to act as the personal consultee and provide assent. In the event of a personal consultee not being available, a nominated consultee (usually the consultant caring for the patient and independent from the study) will be asked if they would provide assent. Both the person taking assent and the consultee must personally sign and date the relevant form.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><sec id="s3-9-1"><title>Sequence generation, allocation concealment and implementation</title><p>Following screening and obtaining informed written consent from an eligible patient, a unique identification number will be assigned consecutively. A research team member will then use this identification number to randomise the participant to either the intervention or control group, via an internet-based randomisation service (sealedenvelope.com). This service uses permuted blocks of varying sizes and generates a randomisation code which corresponds to one of the study arms. Research staff will use the allocation code generated from sealedenvelope.com to assign the patients to the intervention or control group.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9-2"><title>Blinding</title><p>As this is a pragmatic trial of a diagnostic strategy where the results of the test must be communicated to clinical and infection control teams, no attempt at blinding trial participants, research staff or care providers will be made.

Data will be recorded on a standardised case report form (CRF) and transferred to a secure electronic database. Once patients have been discharged or after 30 days (whichever is soonest), outcome data will be collected retrospectively from electronic and physical case notes, electronic prescribing systems and laboratory and radiological results systems including: use of antivirals, duration of antivirals, time from assessment to antiviral use, use of antibiotics, duration of antibiotic use, use of side room facilities, time from assessment to isolation facility use, time to clinical stability, duration of supplementary oxygen use, duration of hospitalisation, complications including ICU and HDU admission, representation and readmission to hospital within 30 days, final diagnosis and mortality. The number of diagnostic tests and procedures performed will also be recorded and data will also be collected on the turnaround time of respiratory virus test results in each group. Patients withdrawn from the study will have no further data collected.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9-3-2"><title>Data management</title><p>The study will be conducted in compliance with the approved protocol, relevant International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations and standard operating procedures.

The study team will keep a log of each subject&#x02019;s name, hospital identification (ID) number, date of birth and unique participant trial number. The participant details will be recorded on the secure NHS Edge system in a similar manner, including NHS number. This participant trial number is used on documents after screening to maintain confidentiality. Documents that are not anonymous (eg, signed informed consent forms) will be maintained separately, in strict confidence and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. A secure database will be used to enter data from the CRFs at the completion of the study, followed by data lock.</p><p>The study staff will be responsible for entering study data in the CRF. It is the investigators&#x02019; responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the data entered in the CRF.</p><p>Only the research study team will know the identity of subjects and have access to the list linking participant details to the participant trial number.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Analysis will be by intention to treat (ITT).

</p><p>Statistical analysis will be performed by a dedicated medical statistician from the University of Southampton, independent from the study team. No interim analysis is currently planned.

Difference in proportions and unadjusted ORs will be used to compare the groups. The effect of group on the primary outcome will be further assessed using multiple logistic regression to control for the following covariates: age, sex, influenza vaccine status, receipt of antibiotics prior to admission, duration of illness, comorbidity, temperature, C reactive protein, severity of illness and clinical group.</p><p>Certain secondary outcome measures will be measured both in the entire cohort (ITT population) and in the influenza-infected cohort (the ITTI population) while others will only be measured in the ITTI population, as detailed in the outcome section. The intervention and control groups will be compared as per the primary outcome for equality of proportions for binary data and using t-tests and non-parametric equivalent tests for continuous data (eg, turnaround time) as appropriate.</p><p>In view of the clinical heterogeneity of patients infected with influenza, heterogeneity of effect among different clinical subgroups is anticipated a priori and therefore a preplanned subgroup analysis for key secondary outcome measures may be undertaken based on clinical group (exacerbation of asthma, exacerbation of COPD, pneumonia, ILI, non-pneumonic LRTI and &#x02018;other&#x02019;) and also based on receipt or otherwise of antiviral treatment (the receipt of NAIs within 5 days of admission). The interaction between clinical subgroups and allocation group will be assessed in the multiple regression models detailed above.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Monitoring</title><p>This trial was reviewed by the sponsor.

We expect increased, timely detection of influenza and that this will lead to improved use of NAI treatment. Rapid and appropriate use of NAI treatment in influenza may also lead to decreased complication and mortality and may shorten length of stay in hospital. The rapid detection of viruses may improve isolation facility use within the NHS with subsequent reduction in nosocomial transmission of viruses and improvements in patient flow through acute areas. The use of a POCT for respiratory viruses may also identify patients where unnecessary antibiotic use can be safely discontinued, promoting antibiotic stewardship and reducing antimicrobial resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e213"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2019-031674.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e214"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2019-031674.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank patients and staff in the emergency department and acute medical unit and other inpatient wards at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust for making the study possible.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TC conceived the study and is the chief and principal investigator.
