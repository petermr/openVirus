 <p>In December, 2015, 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito-transmitted Zika outbreaks started in the French West Indies, about two years after chikungunya epidemics, spread by the same mosquito, hit the same region. Building on the similarities between these epidemics—regarding the route of transmission, the surveillance system, the population and the location—we show that prior information available at the time could have improved the forecasting of relevant public health indicators (i.e. epidemic size, maximal incidence, peak date and epidemic duration) from a very early point. The method we describe, together with the compilation of past epidemics, improves epidemic forecasting.
