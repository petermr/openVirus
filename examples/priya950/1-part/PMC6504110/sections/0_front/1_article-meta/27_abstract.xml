 <p>Dengue viruses 1–4 (DENV1-4), Zika virus (ZIKV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are tropical and subtropical viruses that share a common arthropod vector, and have very similar clinical presentations that are difficult to distinguish. With the recent outbreaks of DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV globally, a single methodology able to simultaneously distinguish these viruses and provide full-genome information would greatly increase our capacity to rapidly characterize outbreaks. As a proof of principle, we have applied this methodology to two large cohorts in Sri Lanka and Singapore taken during recent dengue and Zika outbreaks, respectively. Herein, we present the results of this application to these cohorts and provide the tools to replicate these methodologies for other cohorts.</p>
