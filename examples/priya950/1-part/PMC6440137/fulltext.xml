Thus, investigating spatiotemporal patterns and potential influencing factors of DF epidemics in typical regions is critical to consolidate effective prevention and control measures for these regional epidemics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to identify potential contributing factors that influence spatiotemporal epidemic patterns in typical DF epidemic regions of China (e.g., the Pearl River Delta [PRD] and the Border of Yunnan and Myanmar [BYM]). In terms of influencing factors, environmental factors including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), temperature, precipitation, and humidity, in conjunction with socioeconomic factors, such as population density (Pop), road density, land-use, and gross domestic product, were employed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">DF epidemics in the PRD and BYM exhibit prominent spatial variations at 4&#x02009;km and 3&#x02009;km grid scales, characterized by significant spatial clustering over the Guangzhou-Foshan, Dehong, and Xishuangbanna areas. The GAM that integrated the Pop-urban land ratio (ULR)-NDVI-humidity-temperature factors for the PRD and the ULR-Road density-NDVI-temperature-water land ratio-precipitation factors for the BYM performed well in terms of overall accuracy, with Akaike Information Criterion values of 61&#x02009;859.89 and 826.65, explaining a total variance of 83.4 and 97.3%, respectively. As indicated, socioeconomic factors have a stronger influence on DF epidemics than environmental factors in the study area. Among these factors, Pop (PRD) and ULR (BYM) were the socioeconomic factors explaining the largest variance in regional epidemics, whereas NDVI was the environmental factor explaining the largest variance in both regions. In addition, the common factors (ULR, NDVI, and temperature) in these two regions exhibited different effects on regional epidemics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The spatiotemporal patterns of DF in the PRD and BYM are influenced by environmental and socioeconomic factors, the socioeconomic factors may play a significant role in DF epidemics in cases where environmental factors are suitable and differ only slightly throughout an area. Thus, prevention and control resources should be fully allocated by referring to the spatial patterns of primary influencing factors to better consolidate the prevention and control measures for DF epidemics.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40249-019-0533-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Spatiotemporal pattern</kwd><kwd>China</kwd><kwd>Dengue fever</kwd><kwd>Generalized additive model</kwd><kwd>Socioeconomic factor</kwd><kwd>Environmental factor</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41571158</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFC1201305</award-id><award-id>2016YFC1302602</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Innovation Project of LREIS</institution></funding-source><award-id>O8R8B6A0YA</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning</institution></funding-source><award-id>15GWZK0201</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Multilingual abstracts</title><p id="Par24">Please see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for translations of the abstract into the five official working languages of the United Nations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par25">Dengue fever (DF) is an acute infectious disease caused by the dengue virus, which is transmitted by <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately one-third of the global population is exposed to DF, which is widely endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, especially in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, and southern Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In recent years, the increasing incidence and range of DF epidemics have had a serious impact on people&#x02019;s health and lives, and DF has become a public health problem that should not be underestimated.</p><p id="Par26">In the mainland of China, DF is currently a localized epidemic caused by imported cases.

However, additional knowledge is needed regarding the spatial-temporal characteristics of the epidemic in China&#x02019;s typical DF epidemic areas and the differences in influencing factors. Our study was performed to 1) analyse the spatial-temporal pattern of DF epidemics in two regions and 2) use a generalized additive model (GAM) to analyse and compare the main influencing factors affecting the spatial disparities of DF in the two regions. The results of this study will provide important support for strengthening the prevention and control of DF outbreaks in the PRD and BYM and raising the level of prevention of DF risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par28">The PRD (111&#x000b0;28&#x02032;&#x02013;114&#x000b0;42&#x02032;E, 22&#x000b0;16&#x02032;&#x02013;23&#x000b0;57&#x02032;N) in the Guangdong Province is located at the Pearl River estuary and includes nine cities, such as Guangzhou and Foshan (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Strengthening our understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns and differences between the influencing factors of DF epidemics in China&#x02019;s typical DF epidemic areas is of considerable significance because such data can improve our ability to prevent and control the DF risk in high-incidence areas.</p><p id="Par45">The epidemic characteristics of the PRD and BYM have quite a few similarities in environmental and socioeconomic factors. Regarding environmental conditions, previous studies have shown that suitable meteorological conditions (Temp at 20&#x02013;30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and Hum of 75%) were conducive to mosquito breeding and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], thereby promoting dengue virus activity and increasing the risk of DF epidemics and transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. According to the basic data of this study, the monthly mean Temp in the PRD and BYM is between 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 27&#x02009;&#x000b0;C from April to November, the monthly mean Pre is 0&#x02013;360&#x02009;mm, and the relative Hum is 63&#x02013;84%. These warm and humid weather conditions are conducive to DF transmission. In addition, the vegetation conditions in these two regions are good (the average NDVI is 0.57 to 0.81). Higher or lower NDVI values will reduce the risk of DF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. High NDVI values generally indicate sparsely populated areas that are unable to meet the conditions of human and mosquito contact for DF. The appropriate vegetation conditions provide not only excellent conditions for the breeding and activity of mosquitoes (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is primarily observed in the PRD, and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is primarily observed in the BYM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] but also cool locations in summer for humans, thereby increasing the probability of contact between humans and mosquitoes and promoting DF epidemic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The warm and humid environmental conditions in the BYM and PRD are suitable for mosquito breeding and activity, which is an important reason for the rapid and widespread prevalence of DF and presents the first similarity of DF epidemics in these two regions.</p><p id="Par46">As for the second similarity of the characteristics of DF epidemic in these two regions, Ren et al. considered that socioeconomic factors might play a significant role in DF epidemics in cases where environmental factors were suitable and differed slightly in regional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This finding is consistent with our results. Although the socioeconomic status (Pop, ULR, and Road) of the PRD is significantly greater than that of the BYM, these two regions present similar differences in development, and this finding can also be confirmed that the coefficient of variation of socioeconomic factors is significantly higher than that of environmental factors. In addition, Zhu et al. noted that a certain degree of population aggregation was an important condition for DF transmission and prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The population is relatively clustered in towns of the BYM (such as Dehong and Xishuangbanna) and the highly urbanized regions of the PRD (such as Guangzhou-Foshan). Therefore, this condition gives a reasonable explanation for the relatively serious epidemic in these areas. In recent years, the PRD has implemented active prevention and control measures, such as water retention and mosquito prevention, and DF epidemics have been effectively controlled. Therefore, based on the similarities between the two regions regarding the spatial patterns and main influencing factors underlying DF epidemics, we suggest that the BYM can draw on the experience of the PRD when formulating DF epidemic prevention and control strategies at the regional level.</p><p id="Par47">Compared with the similarities listed above, the differences in the DF epidemic characteristics between the PRD and the BYM should be further investigated. Regarding the socioeconomic factors, previous studies have shown that a higher ULR corresponded to a larger population, while developed transport networks increased the mobility of people in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The extent and concentration of DF epidemics in the PRD are higher than those in the BYM, which is closely related to the higher Pop, higher ULR, uniform road network distribution, and stronger population mobility. The ULR of the BYM is high only in the central town areas of Dehong and Xishuangbanna (but still lower than that of the PRD), as are Pop and Road. The accessibility of roads throughout the region is not as good as that in the PRD, which can also explain why DF epidemics in the PRD are significantly greater than those in the BYM.</p><p id="Par48">As for the regional environmental factors, the overall vegetation coverage in the BYM is relatively high. Therefore, the NDVI fitting curve of the more serious epidemic areas is shifted to the left compared with that in the PRD. Furthermore, the terrain within the BYM is complex, including large numbers of mountains and valleys. Therefore, regional differences and vertical changes in climate are obvious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], which is different from the decreasing trend of temperature and precipitation in the PRD from south to north and from coast to inland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The coefficient of variation of the environmental factors in the BYM is also slightly higher than that in the PRD. Meanwhile, the risk of DF tends to be higher in Dehong and Xishuangbanna Prefectures due to their higher annual average Temp and Pre, thus providing a favorable living environment for the <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito, which is widely distributed throughout Ruili City (Dehong Prefecture) and Xishuangbanna Prefecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">As for imported cases of DF, the BYM has several ports through which DF is mainly imported by &#x0201c;ground&#x0201d;, including Jinghong Port, Simao Waterway Port, and the busiest port of Rili to Myanmar. These wide ranges of trade ports promote local economic development but also increase the risk of imported DF cases because DF is highly prevalent in areas adjacent to Laos and Myanmar. In addition, Wang et al. confirmed that the local DF epidemic in the BYM in 2013 was caused by imported cases from the neighbouring countries of Southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The developed economy of the PRD results in the majority of imported DF cases being brought by relatively long-distance commercial travel. Meanwhile, as one of the most densely populated areas in China, more than one million migrant workers travel to the PRD each year. These people live in crowded and poor sanitary conditions and less rectified living areas, which are conditions conducive to human-mosquito contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The BYM and PRD are both important ports of land and sea-air entry and exit in China, and they are popular locations for tourists and migrant workers in China. If DF epidemics develop explosive outbreaks in both regions without being effectively controlled, they will spread to adjacent inland areas, which will cause serious impacts to the life and health of people in inland areas. Therefore, the health departments must consider the spatial differentiation characteristics of the main factors affecting DF epidemics in the region and utilize these data to formulate more specific prevention and control strategies.</p><p id="Par50">Several limitations are worth noting. (1) The difference in the severity of the two regional epidemics leads to a significant difference in the confidence interval of the fitting curve, although it does not affect the research paradigm. (2) The effects of mosquito vector and control measures have not been sufficiently considered, and these data should be included in our future work. (3) The spatial correlation between DF epidemics and various influencing factors has not been properly considered in the model, and models such as the GWR, which can consider such spatial correlations, should be included in future studies. (4) This study used the number of DF cases from 2010 to 2014 as the dependent variable, without carefully analysing the lagging effect and temporal effect between DF and its influencing factors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par51">The environmental and socioeconomic factors in the PRD and BYM may affect the spatial-temporal differentiation of DF epidemics, and the influencing mechanisms have their own regional characteristics. The differences in socioeconomic factors are more obvious in cases where environmental factors are suitable and differ slightly throughout areas. This study has improved our understanding of the spatial distribution of DF epidemics and their influencing factors in typical regions of China. We suggest that the epidemic prevention and control strategies for the BYM should be developed in reference to those for the PRD, combined with the characteristics of the main factors influencing the regional epidemic to effectively strengthen the prevention and control measures for DF epidemics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
