This study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the occurrence of CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks throughout the major international seaport city of Barranquilla, Colombia in 2014 and 2016 and the potential for clustering. Incidence data were fitted using multiple Bayesian Poisson models based on multiple explanatory variables as potential risk factors identified from other studies and options for random effects. A best fit model was used to analyse their case incidence risks and identify any risk factors during their epidemics. Neighbourhoods in the northern region were hotspots for both CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks. Additional hotspots occurred in the southwestern and some eastern/southeastern areas during their outbreaks containing part of, or immediately adjacent to, the major circular city road with its import/export cargo warehouses and harbour area. Multivariate conditional autoregressive models strongly identified higher socioeconomic strata and living in a neighbourhood near a major road as risk factors for ZIKV case incidences. These findings will help to appropriately focus vector control efforts but also challenge the belief that these infections are driven by social vulnerability and merit further study both in Barranquilla and throughout the world&#x02019;s tropical and subtropical regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chikungunya virus</kwd><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>spatial clustering</kwd><kwd>Bayesian Poisson models</kwd><kwd>conditional autoregressive models</kwd><kwd>socioeconomic risk factors</kwd><kwd>environmental risk factors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijerph-16-01759"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Since 2013, the two emerging arboviruses, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by the same vector species (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) as the dengue viruses (DENVs), have caused major outbreaks throughout the Americas. CHIKV is thought to have first arrived in the Caribbean region in 2013, and in 2014, it expanded to the mainland regions of Central and South America [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The first autochthonous ZIKV cases were reported in the northeastern region of Brazil in late 2014 [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. By February 2016, local transmission of ZIKV was reported in over 20 countries in the Americas, including a major outbreak in Colombia, for which 65,726 cases were reported by April 2016 [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both of these arboviral infections can lead to significant disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in the affected populations [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CHIKV infections are characterised by a high fever and debilitating symmetrical polyarthralgia/rheumatic disease in nearly all (&#x0003e;80%) cases, many of which result in subchronic or chronic joint disease [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. By stark contrast, 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, and symptomatic patients display lower fevers and milder peripheral symptoms, such as rash, nonpurulent conjunctivitis and oedema [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, in the Americas, ZIKV infections have been implicated in causing severe congenital abnormalities, such as foetal microcephaly, and serious autoimmune neurologic conditions in children and adults, such as Guillain&#x02013;-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as well as dual-gender sexual transmission [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Numerous studies have assessed the local determinants of transmission for the DENVs that in turn led to key discoveries that helped to guide public health and vector control programmes in their efforts to curb epidemics [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Studies have found similar transmission dynamics in CHIKV prevalence. For example, Sissoko et al. found that seroprevalence of CHIKV antibodies in Mayotte was mainly associated with lower socioeconomic status, lower education and makeshift housing [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Perkins et al. found that the seasonal and regional transmission patterns were similar in CHIKV compared with DENV [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, the spread of ZIKV through the Americas was predicted by models that accounted for the suitable environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the regions [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Barranquilla is a major seaport city located on the Caribbean coast and the fourth largest city in Colombia, with a population of nearly 1.4 million individuals and a population density of 7017 persons per square kilometre [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The city, divided into six (1&#x02013;6) socioeconomic strata (SES) [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], is estimated to house 56% of its population in the poorest of those strata [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

The incidence rates were based on both clinical criteria (described below) and laboratory test confirmations. The clinical criteria for CHIKV and ZIKV infections have been regularly used along with confirmatory laboratory tests to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics of these viral infections in Latin America [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

CHIKV- and ZIKV-Infected Case Definitions</title><p>For the Colombian public health system, CHIKV or ZIKV infections were identified based on clinically-assessed criteria with or without laboratory-test confirmations. The criteria for clinical confirmation of CHIKV infection included having a fever (&#x0003e;38 &#x000b0;C), sudden onset of severe arthralgia or arthritis and rash, not explained by other medical conditions, and living in a municipality where diagnosis of circulation by virological methods had previously occurred [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As such, laboratory confirmed CHIKV cases included viral isolation or an RT-PCR positive result for CHIKV cDNA, an anti-CHIKV IgM antibody positive result in an ELISA, or a four-fold increase in the IgG titres between paired (acute and convalescent phase) samples in the ELISA obtained within 2&#x02013;14 days of each other, as described [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>The criteria for clinical diagnosis of ZIKV infections included exanthema (rash) and fever (38 &#x000b0;C), and residence in a municipality with confirmed ZIKV transmission [<xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Additionally, ZIKV infection was considered when the patient had visited a high-risk area 15 days before the onset of symptoms, defined as zones below 2200 metres above sea level in Colombia with confirmation of local ZIKV circulation, and had one or more of the following symptoms: Pruritus (itchiness), arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), headache, or malaise. Laboratory confirmation was achieved by obtaining a RT-PCR positive result for ZIKV cDNA, as described [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>For both CHIKV and ZIKV, we included all clinically suspected cases, epidemiologically suspected or laboratory confirmed cases.

To increase the spatial resolution of multispectral bands (provided at 30 m resolution), a pan-sharpening process was applied, excluding thermal infrared bands, using the 15 m panchromatic band. Atmospheric corrections were then conducted for bands one to eight using the DOS model-based algorithm and assuming 1% minimum reflectance [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Radiance and ground reflectance were subsequently obtained for each band [<xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Band combinations for ideal enhancement of vegetation were obtained from openweathermap.org [<xref rid="B56-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. A traditional infrared colour map with the band combinations of 5-4-3 was used to highlight areas of vegetation.

These raster images were combined to define areas of vegetation, building and water coverage. Finally, zonal histogram statistics were extracted from the raster to calculate the percentage surface area of each neighbourhood that was occupied by vegetation, buildings or water. Next, the MNDWI image was used to calculate the average distance of each neighbourhood from large bodies of water identified in the raster. The Euclidian (straight-line) distance tool in ArcGIS was used to calculate the straight-line distance from the centroid of each neighbourhood to the nearest pixel of water identified in the MNDWI. All geographical processing was performed in ArcGIS 10.3 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) [<xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>A map layer in shapefile format that identified parks, forests and cemeteries throughout the city was downloaded from the bbike.org website [<xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

The Euclidian distance of these identified parks, forests or cemeteries throughout the city was then calculated using the same approach employed to estimate distance of the residents&#x02019; dwellings from water bodies. We then referred to this variable as &#x02018;distance to parks or cemeteries.&#x02019; Each of the covariates listed above were then linked to the map of neighbourhoods in Barranquilla along with the monthly incidence of CHIKV and ZIKV cases.

The hotspot area expanded from a single neighbourhood (1206: El Pueblo), located immediately adjacent to the main warehouses used for delivery and export of cargo to and from the city by road and sea, from August to September to three neighbourhoods (1204, 1205, and 3704) in October to November (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01759-f003">Figure 3</xref>).

Looking at the posterior predictive distributions and the posterior predictive <italic>p</italic>-value, there were clear signs of over-dispersion, since the high degree of variability in the observed SIR values was not accounted for by the model. We therefore introduced a set of independent random effects using the model 2 approach (Text S2) to capture the remaining variability. Since the model 1 approach showed a spatial structure on the distribution of CHIKV SIR values across Barranquilla, we assessed the persisting spatial correlation on the residuals for the fitted model 2, controlling for spatially varying explanatory variables. Indeed, we still observed significant global residual dependence (Moran&#x02019;s I statistic: 0.0716, <italic>p</italic>-value: 0.04); thus, we opted to employ a set of spatially structured random effects that could cope with a global spatial correlation (model 3 approach).

The poorest neighbourhoods, based on three levels of SES (quantiles), were the most at risk for CHIKV infections (reference low SES, medium SES coefficient 0.40, 95% CI 0.22, 0.72; high SES 0.61, 95% CI 0.24, 1.52). In our model, population density, housing density, and percent of dwellings that were houses showed little effect on the incidence of CHIKV-infected cases, while infection risk was increased by 10% for a unit percentage increase of female residents.

Discussion</title><p>The global cluster analysis of the CHIKV-infected case incidences identified hotspots of transmission in the southwestern area of the city. The monthly analysis of local autocorrelation showed that the CHIKV epidemic began within hotspots in the northern area and then moved quickly to the southwestern region of this city, affecting mostly the poorest communities, following the main western circular route (circumvent roads) that was also connected via a road with the principal truck transport depot and the southern road route to the city of Cartagena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01759-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01759-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The epidemic then appeared to spread back to the north of the city and to the southeast of the city via the main circular road. However, it may have also been reintroduced via boats arriving in the international harbour area on the Magdalena River (neighbourhood 2103) or via the road route (southeast direction) to the city of Santa Marta, and finally being transported from those northern neighbourhoods to the adjacent ones in December to January 2015. While there was little global spatial autocorrelation for the ZIKV-infected case incidence, the monthly analysis of local autocorrelation showed a high-risk area in the northern neighbourhoods of the city as the outbreak began. As the outbreak intensified, the central&#x02013;eastern neighbourhoods of the city became important hotspots. It seemed that the ZIKV epidemic spread to the eastern part of the city probably through the main circular road, and a major road that crossed from the northwestern to the mideastern part of the city, in a clockwise direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01759-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01759-f005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Using Bayesian Poisson regression allowing for random effects and controlling for all the covariates (fixed effects) in <xref rid="ijerph-16-01759-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, we found weak evidence that lower SES was associated with higher SIR of CHIKV infection. We, however, found very strong evidence that higher SES and living nearer to main roads had a higher risk for ZIKV infection.</p><p>We believe this is the first report that provides strong evidence that living in higher SES is a risk factor for ZIKV case incidences. Furthermore, the northern neighbourhoods of Barranquilla are of these higher SES, and these neighbourhoods located there were the first to report high infection incidences and appeared to drive both the CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks. Unfortunately, the local health authority&#x02019;s vector surveillance and control teams stated that it has been difficult to implement their work in areas of higher SES due to them being walled and gated communities (&#x02018;conjuntos&#x02019;) with private security guards providing restricted access. Thus, limited, or lack of, access to identify and treat vector-breeding sites in these areas may have accounted for their higher ZIKV case incidence. </p><p>Alternatively, these findings may indicate a reporting bias resulting from these residents having better access to health facilities with resultant higher positive diagnosis rates. The issue of reporting bias was likely exacerbated during the ZIKV epidemic by the widespread media coverage drawn by the association of ZIKV with congenital defects, sexual transmission and severe autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Those with easier access to clinics would have been more likely to present to clinic with milder symptoms and receive the diagnosis of ZIKV as it was sweeping through the city. In addition, people living in higher socioeconomic strata would be more likely to be receiving regular prenatal healthcare, where there is already an over diagnosis of ZIKV [<xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This is in stark contrast to the presentation of CHIKV infection, which results in very high fever and debilitating arthralgias. Our findings may therefore be supported by finding that poverty was associated with reduced ZIKV case reporting in another recent study [<xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, the health authority team&#x02019;s access to these high-risk areas is urgently required to assess whether these results were due to the lack of vector surveillance and control or a higher incidence of case reporting. To our knowledge, higher incidences of vector-borne diseases have usually been associated with lower socioeconomic status [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], often due to poor sanitation and limited access to piped water leading to their need to store domestic water supplies in large water containers, which act as principal breeding sites for the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> vector species, as reported in our study sites [<xref rid="B68-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].

Much lower combined <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. premise indexes, an indicator of premises with active breeding sites, were reported in apartments rather than compound houses in Singapore [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Surprisingly, however, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was shown to have adapted to breeding in the &#x02018;ecosystems&#x02019; present on each floor of high-rise apartment buildings in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia [<xref rid="B75-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>Drawing spatial distinctions between the CHIKV and ZIKV cases assumed that the infected cases reported for these analyses were accurately identified. However, there are known limitations for accurate clinical discrimination amongst arboviral infections, especially since financial restraints made it impossible to perform laboratory confirmation on all suspected cases. Previous projects in Barranquilla further evaluated the frequency with which these methods were used and found that only 1% of ZIKV and 1.7% of CHIKV-infected cases were laboratory confirmed [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Since the CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks occurred in separate time periods, any possible misclassifications were more likely to have been due to the DENVs, of which all four serotypes were previously shown to be endemic in Barranquilla [<xref rid="B76-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. While some studies have been limited by the cross-reactivity of IgM and IgG antibodies generated by patients with DENV and ZIKV (both flaviviruses) infections [<xref rid="B78-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B79-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], all the laboratory-confirmed ZIKV cases in our study were identified by a positive ZIKV-specific RT-PCR.</p><p>We minimised the limitations of the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP) [<xref rid="B80-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] in our study by using neighbourhoods as the unit of analysis that was the smallest possible resolution available to us. However, while these analyses identified neighbourhood-level risk factors, the ecological fallacy prevented us from interpolating this to individual risk level. The statistical regression was limited by the possibility of residual confounding. There were several variables that we were unable to evaluate. The ethnicity of the people living in each neighbourhood may be important, as shown in other studies, where Afro-Colombians were shown to have lower DENV-infected case incidences [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B83-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Occupation, especially since it affects the movement of populations towards and away from neighbourhoods with various disease risk factors, may play an important role, as was reported for DENV-infected case incidences in poor neighbourhoods with high populations of young (&#x0003c;15 years old) [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B84-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], illiterate and unemployed people in Cali, Colombia [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Housing data were unavailable for 30% of the neighbourhoods, while the percentage of dwellings that were houses or apartments was unavailable for 19% of the neighbourhoods. We used a multiple imputation approach to mitigate the effect of unavailable data. This assumed that the unavailable data were missing at random and the imputation model was correctly specified [<xref rid="B85-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].</p><p>The findings in our study are novel in their attempt to correlate previous epidemiological patterns of DENV-infected case incidence neighbourhood risk factors discussed above with those of recent outbreaks of CHIKV and ZIKV. Our spatial exploration clearly identified neighbourhoods that had been hotspots responsible for driving the epidemic waves of CHIKV and ZIKV. It is therefore essential that these hotspots be constantly targeted by the local health authority to reduce <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> breeding sites to a minimum and quickly act to target all areas in and surrounding them when any cases of CHIV or ZIKV are reported. The risk factor analysis provided strong evidence that higher socioeconomic status and living in a residence closer to the main roads were risk factors for ZIKV case incidence. In Barranquilla, the Public Health Department should be empowered to commit more resources to these areas of the city. While it may seem counterintuitive to direct public resources to areas of higher SES, it is urgently required to determine whether higher <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> vector populations or increased residents&#x02019; reporting accounts for our findings. If the former case was responsible, then the public health authorities must identify and destroy the vector breeding sites through drainage or larvicidal treatment.</p><p>Further research also needs to be performed to account for differences in vector breeding, dispersal and disease transmission. During the CHIKV epidemic, the possible introduction of the virus into (a) the northern neighbourhoods and (b) the western neighbourhood (1206), located immediately adjacent to the import/export cargo warehouses via the main circular roads and further dispersal by the main road, as well as its possible later importation into (c) neighbourhood 2103 via cargo ships docking at the major international harbour, is consistent with both major roads [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B86-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,<xref rid="B87-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and seaports/rivers [<xref rid="B87-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B88-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] being important routes for the importation, movement and dispersal of arboviral-infected <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and humans.</p><p>More in-depth data about housing vulnerability could include type of building material, exposure to the outside, and presence of air conditioning, since home air conditioning was a major factor accounting for the much lower DENV sero-positivity for the residents in a study site in Texas, USA compared to that in a twined town in Mexico [<xref rid="B90-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Collecting this information could reduce the residual bias associated with our crude measure of housing type. Further analysis should assess these arboviral case incidences with the residents&#x02019; occupation and other forms of population movement. More detailed vector surveillance is also needed throughout the city to elucidate why the risk factors identified in this study are associated with higher transmission. Although adult <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> are known to fly up to 2 km if required, they usually fly much shorter distances (e.g., 10&#x02013;150 m) to find blood meals and breeding sites [<xref rid="B91-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and there were no natural barriers (e.g., large lakes, parks, hills or valleys) in this urban study site since we did not study any of the (only poor non-urban) neighbourhoods located on the opposite (eastern) bank of the Magdalena River. As no effective treatments or vaccines exist for CHIKV and ZIKV, prevention is still the primary method of control [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B92-ijerph-16-01759" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-16-01759"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study provided an evidence-based framework that public health programmes can use to efficiently target the drivers of future epidemics of CHIKV and ZIKV infections. Our spatial analysis identified key areas of Barranquilla that acted as hotspots during the outbreaks of CHIKV and ZIKV. Furthermore, we clearly showed that living in the high SES was a risk factor for ZIKV case incidence, though this may have been driven by biased case reporting. These richer areas were important hotpots of case incidence during both outbreaks. This novel finding challenges the logic that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-borne infections are driven by social vulnerability and merits further study both in Barranquilla and throughout the tropical and subtropical areas of the world.</p><p>The findings in this article have been relayed to the local health authority (<italic>Distrisalud</italic>) so that their surveillance and vector control teams can more effectively focus their efforts in the neighbourhoods which contain part of or lie immediately adjacent to these major city roads, particularly those also located in: (a) The western region of the city near the main international cargo storage warehouses, (b) the international harbour area and (c) the high SES areas within these northern areas of the city.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank all fellow authors for their contributions and dedication to this work.
