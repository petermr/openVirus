 <p>The aim of this study was to promote the rapid identification of the contacts of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and therefore the control of the pandemic. Different methodologies and recommendations on contact tracing for Primary Health Care (PHC) and Public Health Services (PHS), like articles in Pubmed about COVID-19 and contact tracing, official contact definitions, the classic contact tracing model in tuberculosis (TB), information about apps for contact tracing and the role of the diagnostic tests, were reviewed.</p>
 <p>To establish efficient prevention and control measures, it is always necessary to implement contact tracing based on clinical suspicion, early diagnosis and isolation of cases and contacts and their follow-up. The classic contact tracing model in TB can be applied to this new infection, but accelerating the process given its acute nature and its potential severity. Good coordination between PHC and PHS and having sufficient resources is essential.</p>
