 <p>SARS-CoV-2 is a new RNA virus which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). It triggers an atypical pneumonia that can progress to multiorgan failure. COVID-19 can cause dysregulation of the immune system, triggering an inflammatory response, and simulate haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Several studies have proposed that anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies, such as tocilizumab, play an important role in the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection associated with SARS-CoV-2. However, the role of anti-IL-1 receptor antibodies, such as anakinra, in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been established.</p>
 <p>We present a case report of a 51-year-old man diagnosed with severe respiratory infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 that was refractory to antiviral and anti-IL-6 treatment, with a favourable clinical outcome and analytical improvement after treatment with anti-IL-1 (anakinra).</p>
