Abstract</div> <p>A markedly increased demand for vascular ultrasound laboratory and other imaging studies in COVID-19 positive patients has occurred, due to most with markedly elevated D-dimer, and a presumed prothrombotic state in many of the very ill patients. This article summarizes a broad institutional consensus focusing on evaluation and recommended empirical therapy for COVID-19 positive patients. We recommend following the algorithms with the idea that as more data becomes available that this may well change. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="p0010">The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) traditionally relies upon assessment of the patient for history and physical exam findings consistent with the diagnosis, risk stratification, then imaging with duplex ultrasonography for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or with computed tomography (CT-PE) for pulmonary embolism. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> This common diagnosis and its work up are a familiar thread in the fabric of all emergency departments, inpatient wards and intensive care units across the country and the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive rent in this cloth as hospitals experience a surge of patients: CT PE is often delayed or not performed due to co-morbid renal failure precluding the use of intravenous contrast and cardiopulmonary instability leading to an unacceptable risk for transfer. Similarly, duplex ultrasonography (DUS) for the diagnosis of DVT is difficult to perform due to large number of patients, many of whom will be housed in field hospitals without diagnostic vascular unit labs (DVUs), a contracted registered vascular technician workforce, and length of time associated with and difficulty in completely disinfecting the machines in between patients. </p> <p id="p0015">Beyond the obligation of "do no harm" to our patient population, a global pandemic also shines light on the moral obligations of and to ancillary healthcare staff. For instance, while it is hotly debated on a national stage whether the physician "duty to treat" moral standard should be upheld without proper personal protective equipment, it is even less clear to what obligation the registered vascular technician (RVTs) should be held to when their services only indirectly impact morbidity and mortality. It is arguably both within the realm of physician capability and obligation to minimize exposure to RVTs in our DVUs, while minimizing harm to patients. Furthermore, with a dedicated skill set requiring the use of expensive equipment, RVTs represent a scare resource during a pandemic, that if depleted, would inhibit our ability to detect other life and limb threatening conditions that require urgent/emergent treatment such as acute limb ischemia, pseudoaneurysms and carotid disease leading to stroke. </p> <p id="p0020">Facing mounting requests for duplex ultrasonography (DVT scans) for VTE diagnosis during the exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in our community, we formed an ad hoc committee of venous thrombosis experts, vascular surgeons, hospitalists and critical care physicians, vascular medicine physicians and RVTs. This committee is charged with rapidly reviewing evidence for VTE diagnosis and treatment and adapt clinical algorithms for use during a time when imaging resources, such as ultrasound machines and sonographers with experience and expertise, are expected to be scarce, recognizing both our moral obligation to our patients and to our vascular sonographers. Underlying these algorithms is the absolute commitment at the institutional level to ensure appropriate diagnostic imaging, long term therapy recommendations and follow up once the surge has passed. As a frame of reference, we are expected to experience a volume of &amp;gt;3,000 patients at our peak in Michigan, and to be several fold in excess of our hospital capacity, utilizing field hospitals for approximately 8 weeks. </p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p id="p0025">A committee comprised of vascular thrombosis experts, vascular surgeons, vascular medicine physicians, and vascular technologist was convened. We also sought, via multiple conference calls, input from intensivists, pulmonologists, and hematologists for critique and vetting of the algorithms that resulted. Existing published protocols for diagnosis and management of VTE by our faculty practice group were reviewed, alongside current ACCP and National Institution for Health and Care Excellence. <a href="#bib1"> <sup>1</sup> </a> Our institutional experience with VTE events and utility of empiric low dose anticoagulation with H1N1 viral pneumonia were reviewed, as well as emerging evidence regarding VTE risk in COVID-19 infections. Feedback from content experts in vascular surgery, hematology, pharmacology, internal medicine, cardiology, anesthesiology and critical care was solicited. Implementation was rapidly achieved via dissemination in care bundles, computerized physician order entry (CPOE) sets, and best practice alerts. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p id="p0030">Consensus was achieved regarding 9 critical guiding principles ( <a href="#tbl1">Table I</a> ) based upon best evidence, available resources and ethical obligations to patients and staff. High priority was placed on treating suspected VTE without definitive imaging in the context of acceptable bleeding risk, recognizing the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality. Extreme pragmatism was applied, recognizing the well-being and scarcity of RVTs was paramount over obtaining a diagnosis when clinical management would not be altered. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" position="float" id="tbl1"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table I</span>  </div></p><p>Critical Guiding Principles</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <tbody> <tr> <td>1. All patients with COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 should be treated with thromboprophylaxis. This statement places value on avoiding the need to reassess VTE risk when a patient has a change in status, and accepts overall low bleeding risk associated with use of anticoagulants used at thromboprophylactic doses. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2. Elevated D-dimer is expected with severe COVID infection and should not be a determinant in the decision to obtain imaging. Negative D-dimer in combination with a low clinical risk score can still safely exclude VTE and may have limited utility for this purpose. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3. Current guidelines recommend empiric treatment of suspected PE if imaging is expected to take &amp;gt; 4 hours, or for DVT if imaging is expected to take &amp;gt; 24 hours. We expect that due to stress on the healthcare system that imaging may be delayed for up to a month or greater, but that patients may be safely empirically treated during this time by determining risk-benefit ratio. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>4. Duplex ultrasonography should be utilized when the three following conditions are met simultaneously: (1) bleeding risk is high, (2) the results will change management (3) clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism is high and CT PE is unobtainable <u>or</u> clinical suspicion of DVT is high (based upon modified Wells and Wells scoring systems). </td> </tr> <tr> <td>5. Most patients with confirmed or suspected VTE who are not at high bleeding risk should receive therapeutic doses of anticoagulation. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>6. In patients with ARDS, low dose non-nomogram heparin infusion may reduce risk of major bleeding while still protecting from thrombotic events. There is no data available for this treatment strategy in intubated patients without ARDS. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>7. Patients treated with low dose anticoagulation protocols should be transitioned to full dose anticoagulation when no longer ICU status. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>8. Referral for CT PE or duplex may be performed once patient has recovered as an inpatient, however, may need to be completed in the outpatient setting in a resource scarce setting. CVC venous clinics (or hematology, if a consulting service as inpatient) will provide continuity of care in reviewing these outpatient imaging tests and providing long term anticoagulation recommendations to the patient, thereby expediting discharges without the burden of additional testing and relieving inpatient providers of burden of follow up. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>9. Upper extremity duplex ultrasonography should be limited to patients with unilateral limb symptoms and criteria as listed in #4 and should not be performed routinely. </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> <div class="vteprophylaxis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
VTE prophylaxis</div> <p id="p0035">As an institutional standard, all patients are routinely risk assessed with the Caprini risk assessment model upon admission. <a href="#bib2"> <sup>2</sup> </a> The committee recognized that healthy patients with only a diagnosis may fall into a low risk category that would not warrant VTE prophylaxis. There is a paucity of data on VTE in COVID-19, however one study found a mortality benefit to thromboprophylaxis with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin amongst COVID-19 positive patients with highly elevated (&amp;gt;3x upper limit of normal) D-dimer and sepsis induced coagulopathy score. <a href="#bib3"> <sup>3</sup> </a> The true incidence of VTE is unknown, and likely variable across different patient populations, with the highest case reports of pulmonary embolism (PE) in up to 40% of patients with elevated D dimer undergoing CT PE. <a href="#bib4">4</a>, <a href="#bib5">5</a>, <a href="#bib6">6</a> These data suggest VTE or primary pulmonary thrombi may be an underlying etiology responsible for mortality in severe COVID-19 infections.

In patients meeting these criteria, the following protocol reduced the risk of VTE and primary pulmonary thrombi without increasing bleeding complications: initiation of non-nomogram heparin infusion with a goal Xa between 0.2-0.3; no bolus dose administered. The lower Xa is necessary given the risk of bleeding with hemorrhagic pneumonitis.

In the low bleeding risk patient (VTE-BLEED score &amp;lt;2), we suggest empiric full dose therapeutic anticoagulation for the non-intubated admitted patient.

This specific patient cohort may have additional risk factors that increase bleeding risk such as thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis and other anti-thrombotic use that should be taken into consideration by the clinician at the bedside. Furthermore, the VTE-BLEED scan is validated for bleeding risk over a longer time period than expected in most patients treated with this algorithm, therefore physicians may be comfortable with full dose anticoagulation if a patient has multiple risk factors, recognizing the less absolute number of days subjected to risk. If the DVT scan is negative, then thromboprophylaxis is recommended. If the study is positive, consideration should be given to full dose anticoagulation, or an IVC filter.

Discussion</div> <p id="p0100">It is said that necessity is the mother of innovation. Just a few short months ago, it was inconceivable that hospitals across the United States and the globe would be stretched far beyond capacity, that essential resources would be rationed, and that even the most mundane, everyday clinical diagnosis and treatment algorithms would be altered. This is the current status as only a small aliquot of hours stand between us and the overwhelming tide of patients throughout the nation and in many parts of the world. Proactive use of an algorithmic approach to care in this setting has the following advantages: (1) decreases variability in care across the healthcare system; (2) relieves stress on the individual provider on determining optimal treatment without appropriate and usual diagnostic tests; (3) harnesses existing healthcare infrastructure to ensure conscientious follow up for patients and restore confidence in the system; (4) protects scare resources; and (5) fulfills our moral obligation to our patients and staff. </p> <p id="p0105">As we move forward through the inevitable crush of patients, conserving clinicians’ mental energy for critical decisions should be of the highest priority given the expected emotional and mental exhaustion in the pandemic setting. As vascular specialists, using our knowledge of clinical scoring systems and risk-benefit ratio, we can extrapolate the current knowledge and standard of care to provide practical and pragmatic straightforward rules for treatment that alleviates the bedside clinician mired in the purgatory of diagnostic uncertainty. In this treatment paradigm, we emphasize preventing VTE related morbidity and mortality at the expense of bleeding complications over a short term while imaging is delayed, and also utilizing therapy that has shown benefit for other severe viral states (H1N1). While direct oral anticoagulants are now more readily available, and have improved bleeding profile, we expect that with such a large influx of patients, bleeding complications are a statistical certainty. With such an approach, the commitment to providing follow up – the DVT scan that would normally be obtained in 24 hours, now will be obtained in 2-4 weeks – must be absolute, meticulous and unwavering. </p> <p id="p0110">The lack of hospital system beds across the country alongside the press reports of temporary morgues and ventilator rationing may very well serve to undermine the confidence of Americans in the existing healthcare infrastructure. Using content experts and protocolizing treatment plans is one method that can allow us to maintain consistency in care delivery and restore faith in the local hospital system. Undoubtedly, there are areas beyond VTE where vascular surgeons can and are developing protocols that can help to streamline the care of patients during a time of crisis. During the time of crisis, we can further respond by collating data in an organized fashion, adapting protocols as more is learned and disseminating information rapidly. Vascular surgeons are often the quarterback in crisis; but in the current challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic our role is to use our expertise and tools to protect and aid those serving on the frontlines. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="references">
